,2008,The UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) Trial B of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial.,The Lancet,"Background: The international standard radiotherapy schedule for early breast cancer delivers 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks, but there is a long history of non-standard regimens delivering a lower total dose using fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation). We aimed to test the benefits of radiotherapy schedules using fraction sizes larger than 2·0 Gy in terms of local-regional tumour control, normal tissue responses, quality of life, and economic consequences in women prescribed post-operative radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1999 and 2001, 2215 women with early breast cancer (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) at 23 centres in the UK were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks or 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2·67 Gy over 3 weeks. Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged over 18 years, did not have an immediate reconstruction, and were available for follow-up. Randomisation method was computer generated and was not blinded. The protocol-specified principal endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse, defined as reappearance of cancer at irradiated sites, late normal tissue effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Findings: 1105 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group and 1110 to the 40 Gy group. After a median follow up of 6·0 years (IQR 5·0-6·2) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 2·2% (95% CI 1·3-3·1) in the 40 Gy group and 3·3% (95% CI 2·2 to 4·5) in the 50 Gy group, representing an absolute difference of -0·7% (95% CI -1·7% to 0·9%)-ie, the absolute difference in local-regional relapse could be up to 1·7% better and at most 1% worse after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments indicated lower rates of late adverse effects after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Interpretation: A radiation schedule delivering 40 Gy in 15 fractions seems to offer rates of local-regional tumour relapse and late adverse effects at least as favourable as the standard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions."

"Abdulkarim, B. S., et al.",2016,A phase III randomized control trial comparing skin-sparing helical tomotherapy versus 3D-conformal radiation therapy in early-stage breast cancer: Acute and late skin toxicity outcomes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adjuvant tangent field 3D-conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) to whole breast following breast conservation surgery in early-stage breast cancer (EBC) results in moist desquamation or grade 2 skin toxicity in about 30% of patients. The feasibility of skin-sparing 3DCRT and IMRT system (SST) for adjuvant breast radiation therapy has been confirmed dosimetrically by configuring skin as an organ at risk (OAR). The purpose of the study was to assess whether SST would reduce acute and long-term skin toxicity in EBC patient. Materials/Methods: A single institution phase III randomized control trial was conducted comparing SST to 3D-CRT adjuvant RT in EBC patients with acute and late skin toxicity as primary endpoints. The skin as OAR was defined as the 5-mm strip of ipsilateral breast skin and the skin volume, receiving dose, was restricted up to a max dose of 40 Gy. Treatment of 50 Gy was delivered over 25 fractions. Breast boost was not allowed in this trial. Patients were assessed weekly during RT and then every 3-6 months for a period of 5 years. Toxicity was assessed based on CTCAE v3.0. Results: A total of 177 patients were enrolled between May 2008 and January 2012; 90 to 3D-CRT and 87 to SST. The mean age was 59 years. SST achieved more homogenous coverage of the target than 3D-CRT. The SST arm had a lower incidence of acute toxicity. The incidence of erythema and moist desquamation were significantly higher in the 3D-CRT arm (erythema: 60 vs 39%; P = 0.005; moist desquamation: 33 vs 11%; P = 0.0003). Eleven percent of patients in the 3D-CRT arm had exudate compared with none in the SST arm (11 vs 0%; P = 0.0014). Patients in the 3D-CRT arm had increased incidence of grade 3 tenderness and discomfort of breast (tenderness: 54 vs 24%; P < 0.0001, discomfort: 9 vs 1%; P = 0.019). The independent prognostic factors that contributed significantly to acute toxicity in the multivariate analysis were large breast volume, adjuvant chemotherapy, and 3D-CRT. The median follow-up time was 62.8 months. There was no statistical difference between the two arms in the overall incidence of late toxicities (skin fibrosis, hypopigmentation, skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and pain) except for hyperpigmentation. The 5-year local relapse free survival (LRFS) probability was 95.6% in the 3DCRT arm and 96.0% in the SST arm. The 5-year overall survival probability was 97.7% in the 3C-CRT arm and 98.3% in the SSHT arm. Conclusion: Combining IMRT with explicit reduction in skin dose with 3D-CRT significantly reduced the incidence of moist desquamation compared with solely 3D-CRT. The low incidence of acute toxicity in SST arm did not translate into significant benefit with reduction of late toxicity. However, the SST concept is supported by equivalent LRFS rate in both arm of the trial."
"Abe, O., et al.",1996,Ovarian ablation in early breast cancer: Overview of the randomised trials.,The Lancet,"Background. Among women with early breast cancer, the effects of ovarian ablation on recurrence and death have been assessed by several randomised trials that now have long follow-up. In this report, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group present their third and yearly systematic overview (meta-analysis), now with 15 years' follow-up. Methods. In 1995, information was sought on each patient in any randomised trial of ovarian ablation or suppression versus control that began before 1990. Data were obtained for 12 of the 13 studies that assessed ovarian ablation by irradiation or surgery, all of which began before 1980, but not for the four studies that assessed ovarian suppression by drugs, all of which began after 1985. Menopausal status was not consistently defined across trials; therefore, the main analyses are limited to women aged under 50 (rather than 'premenopausal') when randomised. Oestrogen receptors were measured only in the trials of ablation plus cytotoxic chemotherapy versus the same chemotherapy alone. Findings. Among 2102 women aged under 50 when randomised, most of whom would have been premenopausal at diagnosis, 1130 deaths and an additional 153 recurrences were reported. 15-year survival was highly significantly improved among those allocated ovarian ablation (52.4 vs 46.1%, 6.3 [SD 2.3] fewer deaths per 100 women, logrank 2p = 0.001), as was recurrence-free survival (45.0 vs 39.0%, 2p = 0.0007). The numbers of events were too small for any subgroup analyses to be reliable. The benefit was, however, significant both for those with ('node positive') and for those without ('node negative') axillary spread when diagnosed. In the trials of ablation plus cytotoxic chemotherapy versus the same chemotherapy alone, the benefit appeared smaller (even for women with oestrogen receptors detected on the primary tumour) than in the trials of ablation in the absence of chemotherapy (where the observed survival improvements were about six per 100 node-negative women and 12 per 100 node-positive women). Among 1354 women aged 50 or over when randomised, most of whom would have been perimenopausal or postmenopausal, there was only a nonsignificant improvement in survival and recurrence-free survival. Interpretation. In women aged under 50 with early breast cancer, ablation of functioning ovaries significantly improves long-term survival, at least in the absence of chemotherapy. Further randomised evidence is needed on the additional effects of ovarian ablation in the presence of other adjuvant treatments, and to assess the relevance of hormone-receptor measurements."
"Abner, A. L., et al.",1991,"Cosmetic results after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for early breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) is increasingly being used in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of early stage breast cancer. To assess the effect of CT on the cosmetic outcome of the irradiated breast, we retrospectively reviewed the cosmetic results of patients who received either cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil (CMF) or doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in conjunction with breast irradiation between 1968 and 1985. The overall cosmetic results were evaluated by the physician as ''excellent,'' ''good,'' ''fair,'' or ''poor'' using a standardized scale. The CT group consisted of 170 patients treated with CT and RT administered either concurrently or sequentially (CT before RT, after RT, or both) with a minimum of 24 months of cosmetic follow-up. These were compared to an RT alone control group of 170 patients who did not receive CT and were matched by tumor size, radiation technique, and year of treatment. At 36 months, the cosmetic scores for the CT group compared to RT alone were 47% versus 71% excellent (p < 0.01), 36% versus 19% good, and 17% versus 9% fair or poor. For the 50 patients treated with concurrent CMF and RT, the scores were 31% excellent, 45% good, and 24% fair/poor, whereas for the 118 patients treated with sequential RT and CT they were 54%, 31%, and 14%, respectively. There was no difference between those patients who received sequential CMF and those treated with doxorubicin. We conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy adversely affects the cosmetic outcome of breast irradiation, but that this effect is not clinically significant unless CMF is administered concurrently with RT. Patients treated with either sequential CMF or doxorubicin-based CT had only a slight decrement in their cosmetic result compared to patients treated without CT."
"Abo-Madyan, Y., et al.",2013,Cosmetic outcome of hypofractionated breast cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy: A preliminary report of a prospective trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the cosmetic outcome and early side effects between hypofractionated (HF) and normofractionated (NF) tangential intensity modulated radiation therapy (tIMRT) as part of breast conserving therapy of early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: To date, 80 early breast cancer patients older than 60 years were stratified in two groups, 43 right-sided patients to 40 Gy in 15 fractions and 37 left-sided to 50 Gy in 25 fractions. A 16 Gy boost was added to patients younger than 70 years. tIMRT was performed according to strict dosimetric limits to ensure dose homogeneity. Weekly cone beam CT was performed to enhance treatment accuracy. Based on CTC-AE v3 and LENT-SOMA scales treatment related toxicity was prospectively documented. We report on early adverse effects at 1 and 6 weeks after end of RT compared to baseline pre-RT signs and symptoms. Results: Both groups had minor differences in average breast size (1105 cc right vs 1147 cc left) and number of patients receiving a boost (around 50% in each). Median age was 69 years in each group. Dose homogeneity did not differ significantly between both groups. In the HF and NF groups the peak incidence of acute dermatitis was at 1 week with 11.6 and 10.8% G2-dermatitis, respectively. At 6 weeks only maximum of G1-dermatitis in 20 and 16% was still observed. Hyperpigmentation was persistent between the 1st and 6th weeks and was higher in the NF group with G1+2 hyperpigmentation in 56.8% compared to 39.5% in the HF group. Breast edema reached a peak at 1 week and tended to be less incident in the HF group with G1+2 edema in 23.3% vs 32.4% in the NF group. Breast retraction was evident in around 8% of patients in both groups at baseline. It increased to 21% in the HF group at 1 week vs 16% in the NF group. However, at 6 weeks incidence was close again at 16.3% and 18.9%, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 adverse effects were observed in all previously mentioned outcome points. At 1 week G2 breast pain was doubled (to a total of 12.5%) in both groups then dropped again to baseline values (6.25%) after 6 weeks. A maximum of G3 breast pain was observed in 1 patient in each group (total 2.5%) at 6 weeks. Conclusions: tIMRT as part of breast conserving therapy causes minor acute side effects. The hypofractionated treatment schedule was generally better tolerated and caused relatively less cosmetic disfigurement in the early post therapeutic phase."
"Abo-Madyan, Y., et al.",2016,Intraoperative (IORT) versus whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) for early breast cancer: Single-center results from the randomized phase 3 targit-A trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): For a selected group of breast cancer patients, partial breast irradiation in the form of IORT added to breast conserving surgery is non-inferior to WBRT. Here we present the results of patients treated in our center as a part of the TARGIT-A trial. Materials/Methods: Patients ( ± 45 y) with cT1 (< 2 cm) cN0 cM0 and invasive ductal histology on biopsy were randomized between immediate post-resection IORT (Arm-A) or post-operative WBRT (Arm-B). IORT was delivered using a 50kV mini accelerator and spherical applicators up to 20 Gy. WBRT was delivered up to 50-56 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Postoperatively, patients in Arm-A with extensive ductal component, invasive lobular carcinoma, multifocality, lymph vessel invasion or small resection margins (< 1cm) received post-operative WBRT up to 46 Gy and those with lymph node metastases with 50 Gy to the breast and lymphatics. Results: Between 2002 and 2012, 185 patients were randomized, 91 in Arm-A and 94 in Arm-B. Two of the patients in Arm-B never showed for follow up and were removed from further analysis. Median follow up was 74 months (Arm-A: 74 month, Arm-B: 75 months). The median age at randomization was 65 years. At the last follow-up the median patients' age was 70 years. According to intention to treat analysis, the 5 year overall survival (OAS) was 94.9% in Arm-A and 92.7% in Arm-B ( P = 0.948). The 5 year local recurrence free survival was 100% in Arm-A and 98.8% in Arm-B with only one local recurrence diagnosed after 4.5 months of follow-up. The 5 year in-breast-recurrence/second primary free survival (out of index quadrant) was 98.9% with one recurrence in each study arm 86 and 43 months after surgery. Both patients had received WBRT as part of their treatment. Conclusion: The local recurrence rate after single dose IORT for early breast cancer in our local cohort with mature follow-up is extremely low."
"Acharya, S., et al.",2016,Distance to radiation facility and treatment choice in early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is a recommended alternative to mastectomy (MT) for early-stage breast cancer. Limited access to radiation therapy (RT) may result in higher rates of MT. We assessed the association between distance to the nearest RT facility and the use of MT, in a modern cohort of women. Methods and Materials Women with stage 0-II breast cancer eligible for BCT diagnosed from 2004 to 2010 were identified from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS). Distances from patient census tracts to the nearest RT facility census tract were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify explanatory variables that influenced MT use. Results Of the 27,489 eligible women, 32.1% (n=8841) underwent MT, and 67.8% (n=18,648) underwent BCS. Thirty-two percent of patients lived in a census tract that was >5 miles from an RT facility. MT use increased with increasing distance to RT facility (31.1% at ≤5 miles, 33.8% at >5 to <15 miles, 34.9% at 15 to <40 miles, and 51% at ≥40 miles, P<.001). The likelihood was that MT was independently associated with increasing distance to RT facility on multivariate analysis (P<.001). Compared to patients living <5 miles away from an RT facility, patients living 15 to <40 miles away were 1.2 times more likely to be treated with MT (odds ratio [OR]: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.35, P<.01), and those living ≥40 miles away were more than twice as likely to be treated with MT (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.48-3.17, P<.001). However, in patients younger than 50 years (n=5179), MT use was not associated with distance to RT facility (P=.235). Conclusions MT use in a modern cohort of women is independently associated with distance to RT facility. However, for young patients, distance to RT is not a significant explanatory variable for MT use."
"Agarwal, S., et al.",2015,Meta-analysis of standard versus hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy as part of breast conserving therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast conservation therapy (BCT) for early stage breast cancer involves tumor directed surgery, such as lumpectomy or segmental breast resection, followed by whole breast radiation therapy. Both standard radiation therapy (SRT) and hypofractionated, accelerated whole breast RT (ART) are acceptable options. This meta-analysis of randomized trials aims to determine whether SRT or ART offers improved disease control and/or less toxicity in the context of a large combined dataset. The primary objective was to assess the local (in breast) control of each radiation schedule. Secondary objectives included measures of regional/distant failure, disease-free survival, cause-specific survival, overall survival, acute and late cosmetic toxicity, as well as other measures of chronic toxicity. Materials/Methods: MEDLINE (1966-2014), all 7 databases of the Cochrane Library (1968-2014), and EMBASE (1974-2014) were searched for relevant clinical trials. In addition, Clinicaltrials.gov, ISRCTN, and WHO ICTRP, and meeting abstracts in theWeb of Science Core Collection (1900-2014) were included in the search. Searches were conducted from October 18, 2014 to November 28, 2014. RCTs comparing SRT versus ART among adult women undergoing BCT with stage T1-T2, nodenegative breast cancer or carcinoma in situ. Endpoint follow-up was specified as at least 30 days from the start of RT (acute toxicity) or 3 years from its completion, for assessment of disease control or late toxicity. Five independent reviewers examined 4,265 search results, and 14 trials met our inclusion criteria. Data were abstracted by two independent reviewers for each eligible study. Results: Fourteen trials with 8,712 participants were included. Based upon seven trials, we detected similar risk of local failure between the two arms (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.78-1.19, I2 = 0%). From eight trials, a similar risk of loco-regional failure (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.63-1.16, I2=0%), and from four trials, an equivalent risk of breast cancer death (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.85- 1.17, I2 = 0%) were determined. Based on five trials, ART trended toward less acute toxicity (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.16-1.11, I2 = 44%) though no differences were noted in late cosmesis (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.81-1.12, I2 = 54%). Conclusion: Evidence from a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials illustrates that ART use does not reduce local control, and may decrease the risk of acute toxicity as compared to SRT."
"Ahlawat, S., et al.",2014,"Accelerated, hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy in women with breast cancer: A phase 2 trial.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast conserving therapy has become standard of care in treating early stage breast cancer. Standard course whole breast irradiation (WBI) takes approximately 6 weeks. The promise of shortcourse WBI lies in the added convenience it may offer to patients. Given excellent cure rates and low morbidity with current adjuvant radiation therapy technique and fractionation, it is natural that subsequent improvements in the field take convenience and economic impact into account. We evaluated a short course of hypofractionated, accelerated whole breast irradiation (AWBI) in which the goal was to complete therapy in 3 weeks inclusive of a sequential boost. Our primary endpoint was freedom from locoregional failure; we incorporated early stopping criteria based on predefined toxicity thresholds. Cosmesis was examined as a secondary endpoint. Materials/Methods: We conducted a prospective, single arm study of patients with DCIS or early stage invasive carcinoma receiving AWBI and a tumor bed boost after lumpectomy. We delivered a whole breast dose of 36.63 Gy in 11 fractions of 3.33 Gy delivered over 11 days, 1 fraction per day (EQD2 = 45 Gy). Patients received a mandatory lumpectomy bed boost delivered in 4 fractions of 3.33 Gy delivered once daily (EQD2Z15 Gy). We allowed treatment of regional lymph nodes if indicated, as well as treatment in the prone position. Acute toxicities were scored using CTCAE v 4. Late toxicities were scored using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Cosmesis was scored using the Harvard Cosmesis Scale. Results: We enrolled 83 women between 2009 and 2012 with Stage 0-IIIa breast cancer. Median follow-up is 33 months. Median age at AWBI is 53.4 with a range of 33.1-79.1 years. Thirty percent of patients were less than 50 years old at AWBI. There were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. One patient experienced grade 3 and 2 patients had grade 2 toxicity. In regards to local control, there were 2 cases of isolated ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) (2/83, crude rate 2.4%). One patient had simultaneous IBTR and distant metastases, while another, had an in breast secondary malignancy (angiosarcoma). Breast cosmesis evaluation revealed that 89% of patients had good/excellent cosmesis. Conclusions: Our phase 2 institutional study offers one of the shortest courses of AWBI-delivered in 15 fractions with a boost. We demonstrated expected low toxicity and high local control rates with this novel fractionation scheme. Patients enrolled in this study had good-excellent cosmetic outcomes. We believe our fractionation scheme is feasible and offers women WBI in a highly convenient schedule. We have opened accrual to an expanded cohort of patients to this study for a descriptive analysis of long-term cosmesis."
"Ahlawat, S., et al.",2010,Riluzole increases ionizing radiation related cellular toxicity in metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 positive human breast cancer cells.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Abnormal glutamate signaling has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer. Riluzole, a drug used in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), decreases metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) activity via glutamate depletion. GRM1 is a member of the seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors for which glutamate is a ligand. Riluzole's action on GRM1 positive cancer cells results in cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase followed by apoptosis. Therapy targeting glutamate signaling may offer a new avenue in cancer treatment. We hypothesize GRM1 positive breast cancer cells will have increased cell kill when treated with ionizing radiation (IR) and riluzole. Materials/Methods: GRM1 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression was examined in a tissue microarray (TMA) of 504 patients with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy. GRM1 expression was correlated with clinico-pathologic factors and outcomes such as ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), nodal failure (NF), locoregional failure (LRF), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS). T47D, human breast cancer cells were used in clonogenic assays to assess cell survival following treatment with IR and riluzole. Western immunoblots were used to examine expression of GRM1 and to look for the apoptotic marker cleaved PARP in treated T47D cells. Double stranded DNA damage (DSD) marker gamma-H2AX (γ-H2AX) was detected using microscopic immunofluorescent visualization in treated T47D cells. Results: TMA analysis revealed that increased GRM1 expression was prognostic for IBTR by univariate and multivariate analysis (p = 0.0021), but did not predict for NF, LRF, DMFS, or OS. In T47D cells, riluzole increased cellular toxicity at 2, 4, 6, and 8 Gy with a 36% reduction in cell survival at 2 Gy (p = 0.002), a 15% reduction at 4 Gy (p = 0.006), and a 5.93% reduction at 6 Gy (p = 0.01). Western immunoblots confirmed GRM1 expression. Immunoblots probed with cleaved PARP showed increased apoptosis at 48 and 72 hours after IR and riluzole treatment. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed an increase in the average number of g- H2AX foci per cell in riluzole treated cells at 0 and 2 Gy (p<0.001). Conclusions: In our cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients, ectopic GRM1 expression by IHC was prognostic for IBTR. Furthermore, GRM1-expressing cells treated with IR and riluzole were found to have increased cellular toxicity and enhanced apoptosis with increased DSD as demonstrated by T47D survival curves, immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence, respectively. The glutamergic signaling pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for the enhancement of radiation-induced cytotoxicity."
"Ahmad, M., et al.",2017,Reduced mean cardiac dose: An additional benefit of hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Mean heart dose (MHD) has been widely accepted as a predictor of long term cardiac toxicity. Additionally, it is known that MHD from whole breast radiation is largely attributable to internal low-isodose scatter. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the impact of different whole breast radiation regimens on MHD on patients enrolled in a phase 2 institutional protocol. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with left-sided Stage 0-II breast cancer who were treated on an institutional protocol in which they received once-weekly whole-breast irradiation (WHBI) to a dose of 2850-3000cGy in 5 fractions were the subject of this analysis. These patients were subsequently re-planned, and MHD was re-calculated using two alternative radiation regimens: conventionally-fractionated (CFRT) and daily hypofractionated (HFRT) radiotherapy (5000cGy in 25 fractions and 4256cGy in 16 fractions, respectively). Ideal MHD was defined as less than 200cGy, which is consistent with established heart dose objectives. Results: A total of 228 plans were generated from 76 patients with left-sided Stage 0-II breast cancer who were treated on a phase 2 protocol. Most of these patients were postmenopausal females (87%) with ER positive tumors (75%) in the outer quadrant of the breast (69%). All patients underwent breast conservation surgery, and the majority did not receive systemic therapy (75%). Of the 76 patients treated with WHBI, 69 (91%) had a MHD less than 200cGy. When the same 76 patients were re-planned, only 58 (76%) of CFRT plans and 42 (55%) of HFRT plans had MHDs that were less than 200cGy. The average MHDs were 1.14Gy, 1.62Gy, 1.97Gy for the WHBI, HFRT, and CFRT regimens. Using the reported 7.4% increase in coronary event rate per Gy established by Darby et al, the detected increase in MHD for HFRT corresponds to a 3.5% (CI: 1.4% to 6.9%) elevated risk of coronary events and for CFRT a 6.1% (CI: 2.4% to 12.0%)elevated risk of coronary events, both relative to WHBI. Conclusion: WHBI is an emerging strategy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer that may offer improved MHD and thus theoretically reduced estimated risk of coronary event relative to traditional regimens. More study is needed to determine whether MHD vs. anatomic dose-volume metrics is the best method of estimating late-cardiac risk in the era of emerging alternative fractionation schemes."
"Akimoto, T., et al.",2001,Clinically evident fat necrosis in women treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy alone for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To investigate the incidence of and variables associated with clinically evident fat necrosis in women treated on a protocol of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy alone without external-beam whole-breast irradiation for early-stage breast carcinoma. Methods and Materials: From 6/1997 until 8/1999, 30 women diagnosed with Stage I or II breast carcinoma underwent surgical excision and postoperative irradiation via HDR brachytherapy implant as part of a multi-institutional clinical Phase I/II protocol. Patients eligible included those with T1, T2, N0, N1 (≤ 3 nodes positive), M0 tumors of nonlobular histology with negative surgical margins, no extracapsular lymph-node extension, and a negative postexcision mammogram. Brachytherapy catheters were placed at the initial excision, re-excision, or at the time of axillary sampling. Direct visualization, surgical clips, ultrasound, or CT scans assisted in delineating the target volume defined as the excision cavity plus 2-cm margin. High activity 192Ir (3-10 Ci) was used to deliver 340 cGy per fraction, 2 fractions per day, for 5 consecutive days to a total dose of 34 Gy to the target volume. Source position and dwell times were calculated using standard volume optimization techniques. Dosimetric analyses were performed with three-dimensional postimplant dose and volume reconstructions. The median follow-up of all patients was 24 months (range, 12-36 months). Results: Eight patients (crude incidence of 27%) developed clinically evident fat necrosis postimplant in the treated breast. Fat necrosis was determined by clinical presentation including pain and swelling in the treated volume, computed tomography, and/or biopsy. All symptomatic patients (7 of 8 cases) were successfully treated with 3 to 12 months of conservative management. Continuous variables that were found to be associated significantly with fat necrosis included the number of source dwell positions (p = 0.04), and the volume of tissue which received fractional doses of 340 cGy, 510 cGy, and 680 cGy (p = 0.03, p = 0.01, and p = 0.01, respectively). Other continuous variables including patient age, total excised tissue volume, tumor size, number of catheters, number of days the catheters were in place, planar separation, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and uniformity index (UI) were not significant. Discrete variables including the presence/absence of DCIS, sentinel versus full axillary nodal assessment, receptor status, presence/absence of diabetes, and the use of chemotherapy or hormone therapy were not found to have a significant association with the risk of fat necrosis. Conclusions: In this study of HDR brachytherapy of the breast tumor excision cavity plus margin, treatment was planned and delivered in accordance with the dosimetric parameters of the protocol resulting in a high degree of target volume dose homogeneity. Nonetheless, at a median follow-up of 24 months, a high rate of clinically definable fat necrosis occurred. The overall implant volume as reflected in the number of source dwell positions and the volume of breast tissue receiving fractional doses of 340, 510, and 680 cGy were significantly associated with fat necrosis. Future dosimetric optimization algorithms for HDR breast brachytherapy will need to include these factors to minimize the risk of fat necrosis. Copyright  Science Inc."
"Alco, G., et al.",2014,Replacement of tumor bed after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery with immediate latissimus dorsi mini-flap.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery satisfies oncologic principles of negative margins and improves cosmetic outcomes, even if excision of a considerably large breast volume is required. During this surgical procedure quadrantectomy cavity is filled by the latissimus dorsi mini-flap which might shift tumor bed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate geographic variability after this procedure and its relevance to radiation therapy planning. Materials/Methods: Between April 2013-January 2014, 22 consecutive patients with early stage breast cancer are enrolled in this prospective study. Two sets of planning computed tomography (CT) scans were performed preoperatively and postoperatively with patients in the treatment position. Both CTs were fused superposing the chest walls. Preoperative tumor bed or excisional biopsy cavity was contoured with the same radiologist under guidance of diagnostic mammography, ultrasonography, and/ or magnetic resonance images. Postoperative lumpectomy cavities were contoured using surgical clips by the same radiation oncologist. Conformity index (CI) was calculated as the ratio of overlapping volume to encompassing delineated volume. CI was defined between 0 and 1, meaning no overlap if 0 and 100% concordance if 1. Paired samples t-test was performed to evaluate the changes in breast volumes. Results: The median interval between two scans was 90 days (range, 14- 170 days). Median age was 44 years (range, 29-69 years). The tumor was situated in the upper outer, retroareolar, lower outer, and lower inner quadrants in 16, 2, 2, and 2 patients, respectively. In 7 cases multifocality was present. Seven patients had excisional biopsy before the preoperative CT. Median pre and postoperative breast CTVs were 442 cc (range, 276- 1061 cc) vs 516 cc (range, 243-917 cc), respectively (p = 0.132). A median of 4 surgical clips (range, 2-6) were inserted during the surgery. Median preoperative tumor volume and postoperative lumpectomy cavity volumes were 6.6cc (range, 0.4-49 cc) and 22.95 cc (range, 6.2-102.2 cc), respectively. Median CI was 0.07 (in 5 cases 1, and in 8 cases 0). Median shifts between the center of volumes were 1.02 cm (range, 0.4-4.43 cm) in x, 1.07cm (range, 0.05-5.67 cm) in y, and 1.12cm (range, 0-3.75 cm) in z directions. Conclusions: Our study shows that the tumor bed is remarkably replaced after oncoplastic surgery with latissimus dorsi mini-flaps. Only in 5 of 22 cases, preoperative tumor bed and postoperative lumpectomy cavity were fully superposed. In remaining cases there were remarkable shifts between two volumes. Special care should be given for defining lumpectomy cavity in radiation therapy planning."
"Algan, O., et al.",1998,Use of the prone position in radiation treatment for women with early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The prone position has been advocated for women with large pendulous breasts undergoing breast-conserving treatment with radiation therapy. However, there is no information in the literature regarding the coverage of the target volume with this technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the prone treatment position in including at least the biopsy cavity with a 2-cm margin. Methods and Materials: Eleven consecutive patients who underwent CT simulation in the prone position were included in this study. Patients underwent CT simulation in the prone position using a flat platform containing an aperture for the breast to hang through in a dependent fashion. CT slices were 5-mm thick taken at 3-mm intervals. The biopsy cavity was localized and outlined on sequential CT images using the surgical clips (when present) as well as the residual seroma. A 2-cm margin was included around the biopsy cavity to define the minimal target volume (mTV). Lateral fields were used for treatment planning. The beam arrangements were considered adequate if the mTV was totally included in the lateral fields. Results: Median age of the patient population was 55 years. Bra sizes ranged from 36A-44DD. The majority of patients had mammographically detected T1 lesions. Median volume of the biopsy cavity was 48 cm3. Five of 11 (45%) patients underwent reexcision of the biopsy cavity, and 6 of 11 (55%) had surgical clips placed in the biopsy cavity. Overall, 8 of 11 (73%) patients did not have the entire mTV included in the lateral opposed tangential fields in the prone position. This was especially true in patients whose biopsy cavity extended down to the chest wall. There were no other clinical factors that could predict for the adequacy of coverage in the prone position. Conclusion: Special attention must be paid to the location of the surgical clips to determine the proximity of the biopsy cavity to the chest wall, or CT simulation should be performed to determine the exact location of the biopsy cavity prior to selecting patients with large pendulous breasts for treatment in the prone position."
"Anderson, J., et al.",2019,Proton Beam Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation: Prospective Multi-Institutional PCG Registry Analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate toxicities and clinical outcomes after accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using proton beam therapy (PBT) for early breast cancer. Materials/Methods: In the prospective multi-institutional Proton Collaborative Group registry, 43 patients with 45 treated breasts (2 patients treated bilaterally) received proton APBI. Toxicities were prospectively evaluated using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Toxicities were considered acute if they occurred within 6 months after starting PBT and late if they occurred or persisted beyond 6 months after starting PBT. Clinical data was obtained directly from patient charts. Luminal A was defined as ER/PR-positive, HER2-normal, Ki-67 <14%. Luminal B was defined as ER/PR-positive, HER2-normal, and Ki-67 ≥14%. Kaplan Meier curves were used to measure clinical outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed using a data and decision management software. Results: Median follow-up was 11.8 months (range 0-36.6). Median age was 67 (range 47 – 81). Median body mass index (BMI) was 29.3 (range 18.4 – 44.9). Histologic subtypes included: 11 Luminal A, 18 Luminal B, 3 triple-positive, 7 unspecified ER/PR-positive HER2-normal, and 6 DCIS. TNM stage included: 3 pTisNx, 3 pTisN0, 36 pT1N0, 1 ypT1N0, 1 pT1N1a, and 1 pT2N0. All invasive margins were negative. DCIS margins were < 2 mm in 5 cases (4 of whom also had invasive disease). Surgery included 45 lumpectomies and 2 re-excisions. One patient had implants, and one patient had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER-2 therapy. Median PBT dose was 40 Gy Relative Biologic Effectiveness (RBE) in 10 fractions. One patient withdrew after 16 Gy RBE. Proton technology included 76.7% uniform scanning, 18.6% pencil beam scanning, and 4.7% unreported. Adjuvant endocrine therapy was employed in 85%. Maximum toxicity was grade 2. Grade 2 toxicities included 1 patient with acute grade 2 lymphedema and 2 patients with late grade 2 dermatitis. Grade 1 toxicities included 32 patients with dermatitis, 10 with fatigue, 10 with pain, 4 with cough, 3 with pruritus, 2 with hyperpigmentation, 2 with nipple deformity, 1 with lymphedema, and 1 with skin induration. Eight patients (18.6%) had no radiation-related toxicities at time of last follow-up. No patient experienced local recurrence, metastasis, or death. Conclusion: Proton APBI was safe and well-tolerated. Only 7% of patients experienced grade 2 toxicity. Over 18% of patients experienced no radiation related toxicities at time of last follow-up."
"Anderson, P. J., et al.",2010,Interstitial high dose rate brachytherapy for early stage breast cancer: Median 6 year follow-up of 268 cases using multi-catheter technique.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) has been the standard of care for breast conservation radiation therapy. Recent data indicates that Interstitial Implant and High Dose Rate (HDR) radiation afterloading compares very favorably to EBRT in selected patients. Materials/Methods: Patients with Tis, T1, and T2 tumors measuring < 4 cm, negative surgical margins, and < 3 axillary lymph nodes were judged to be candidates for Interstitial Implant. Implants were performed under Stereotactic Mammographic guidance with conscious sedation and local anesthesia. The implants were placed with a custom designed template using from 3 to 8 planes, and 8 to 74 needles. Catheters were subsequently threaded thru the needles, and the needles removed. Catheter spacing was 1.0 to 1.5 cm. Radiation Treatment planning was performed using CT Scanning and the Plato System. Treatment volumes ranged from 25 cm3 to 359 cm3. HDR treatment was given using the Nucletron afterloading system. The breast implant volume received 3400 c Gy in 10 fractions prescribed to the Planning Target Volume, given BID over 5 days. Results: Between 2000 and 2010, 268 patients underwent Interstitial HDR Implant. The procedure was well tolerated. No patient required hospital admission. With a median follow-up 72 months (range, 6-128 months), local recurrence occurred in 3.7% (10/ 268). Cosmetic results were good to excellent in 89.5% (240/268) of the patients. There were no infections. Wound healing complications developed in 3.0% (8/268). Three of these patients had received anthracycline based Chemotherapy. The other five had large (>200 cm3) implant volumes, catheter spacing of 1.5 cm, and V-150% of >30%. Two patients healed after 6 months of conservative treatment. Surgery was required in six patients who developed fat necrosis. Conclusions: With median 72 month follow-up, Breast Conservation radiation therapy utilizing InterstitialMulti-Catheter HDR Implant has yielded local recurrence rates and cosmetic results which compare favorably to EBRT in selected patients. Treatment with anthracycline based Chemotherapy, large (>200 cm3) implant volumes, and V-150% >30%, appear to be relative contraindications to Interstitial HDR Implant. Finally, catheter spacing of 1 cm yielded optimal dosimetry and minimized complications. Compared to Mammosite and Contura techniques, the InterstitialMulti-Catheter method offers greater flexibility of radiation delivery. Advantages, include no concern regarding surgical cavity shape irregularities, balloon conformality to surgical cavity, balloon rupture, balloonmovement, air gaps, hematoma, seroma, skin balloon proximity to skin, balloon shape distortion, and cathetermovement within the balloon."
"Anderson, P. R., et al.",2010,The influence of extensive intraductal component on outcome in patients with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation Therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of extensive intraductal component (EIC) on outcome in patients with early stage breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: From 1970 to 2009, 2461 patients underwent conservative surgery and radiation therapy. Three hundred sixty-three patients had EIC on pathologic evaluation (EIC positive) and 2098 patients had no EIC (EIC negative). EIC was defined as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) occupying 25% or more of the area encompassed by the invasive tumor and DCIS present in normal adjacent breast tissue. The median follow-up was 61 months for the EIC positive group and 80 months for the EIC negative group. The two groups were compared for differences in the clinical factors of age, race, tumor size, menopausal status; the pathologic factors of histology, grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), final margin status, nodal status, receptor status; and treatmentrelated factors of systemic chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Ten-year rates of local (LF), regional (RF) and distant failure (DF) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Comparisons were made using the log-rank test. Cox multivariate regression models (MVA) were used to determine independent predictors of outcome. Results: Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed for age, nodal status, LVI and final margin status. The median age was 59 yrs (range, 20-93) for the EIC positive group and 57 yrs (range, 28-89) for the EIC negative group. More patients with EIC were >45 years old (46% vs. 38%; p = 0.0006). More patients in the EIC positive group had negative lymph nodes (77% vs. 69%; p = 0.02), no LVI (53% vs. 41%; p = 0.0001) and smaller tumor size (88% T1 vs. 76% T1; p = 0.0001) compared to the EIC negative group. There were more patients in the EIC positive group with margins < 2 mm (21% vs. 14%; p = 0.0001) compared to the EIC negative group. The menopausal status, receptor status, and use of systemic therapy were comparable between the two groups. Statistically significant differences were observed between the EIC positive group and the EIC negative group for the actuarial 10-year rates of LF (8% vs. 4%; p = 0.0025), RF (8% vs. 5%; p = 0.013), and DF (14% vs. 8%; p = 0.008). On MVA, the presence of EIC positive histology was found to be a statistically significant predictor of LF (p = 0.02), but not of RF (p = 0.12) or DF (p = 0.07). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the largest series to date demonstrating that the presence of EIC is associated with a higher rate of LF at 10 years. However, the LF rates remain low even in patients with EIC positive disease. Therefore, patients with EIC positive histology should continue to be offered breast conservation therapy as an appropriate treatment option."
"Aneja, S. and J. B. Yu",2016,Health-related quality of life in elderly breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiation therapy (BCS+RT) and mastectomy with breast reconstruction (MBR) are both acceptable treatment options for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (BCa). Although rates of MBR have increased, recent evidence suggests a higher complication rate. We hypothesize that there exist differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between patients following BCS+RT and MBR. Materials/Methods: Using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medicare Health Outcome Survey linked dataset, we identified patients diagnosed with early stage (T1-2N0-1) BCa treated with BCS+RT or MBR from 1998 to 2011. Patients who received MBR followed by RT were excluded. HRQOL was assessed using surveys completed >3 months following patients' initial treatment. Patients were assigned physical component scores (PCS) related to patient limitations due to fatigue/bodily pain and mental component scores (MCS) related to patient emotional problems and self-confidence. Higher PCS and MCS scores suggest higher physical and mental HRQOL, respectively. Random effects logistic regression models clustered by health service area were constructed to identify clinical and sociodemographic characteristics associated with MBR use. Mahalanobis-matching on significant predictors was used to match patients from both treatment groups within the first 2 years of treatment and beyond. Two-sided t-tests were used to test differences between MCS and PCS between treatment groups. Results: We identified 2,619 patients diagnosed with early stage-breast cancer with available HRQOL information. 1,237 patients (47.2 %) underwent BCS+RT and 103 patients (3.9 %) received MBR. Younger (OR Z3.1, P < 0.001), unmarried (1.6, PZ0.041), affluent (1.81, PZ0.027) patients with stage 2 disease (OR = 2.19, P < 0.001) were more likely to undergo MBR. Within 2 years of treatment, compared to patients undergoing BCS+RT, MBR exhibited significantly poorer physical HRQOL (-10.6% difference, P < 0.001), but significantly improved mental HRQOL (5.3% difference, P = 0.021). In follow up longer than 2 years, MBR was still associated with worse physical HRQOL (-6.3% difference, P = 0.002), but non-significant differences in mental HRQOL (1.4% difference, P = 0.344). Conclusion: Although MBR is associated with a transient mental HRQOL benefit compared to BCS+RT within the first two years of treatment, it also is associated with decreased physical HRQOL within the first two years of treatment and in longer follow up. Our study provides context to patients and clinicians in weighing the risks and benefits of treatment modalities to aid in informed decision-making. Further studies involving HRQOL are needed to provide framework for highest value treatment options."
"Antonucci, J. V., et al.",2009,Differences in Patterns of Failure in Patients Treated With Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Versus Whole-Breast Irradiation: A Matched-Pair Analysis With 10-Year Follow-Up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To examine 10-year results of a single institution's experience with radiotherapy limited to the region of the tumor bed (i.e., accelerated partial breast irradiation, [APBI]) in selected patients treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and compare them with results of matched BCT patients who underwent whole-breast irradiation (WBI). Patients and Methods: A total of 199 patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated prospectively with BCT and APBI using interstitial brachytherapy. To compare potential differences in local recurrence rates on the basis of the volume of breast tissue irradiated, patients in the APBI group were matched with 199 patients treated with WBI. Match criteria included tumor size, nodal status, age at diagnosis, margins of excision, estrogen receptor status, and use of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Local-regional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed between treatment groups. Results: Median follow-up for surviving patients was 9.6 years (range, 0.3-13.6 years). Eight ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTRs) were observed in patients treated with APBI. The cumulative incidence of IBTR at 10 years was 5%. On matched-pair analysis, the rate of IBTR was not statistically significantly different between the patient groups (4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-6.7% for WBI therapy patients vs. 5%, 95% CI 1.5-8.5% for APBI patients; p = 0.48). Conclusions: Radiation therapy limited to the region of the tumor bed (APBI) produced 10-year local control rates comparable to those from WBI in selected low-risk patients.  Inc.

"Arcangeli, G., et al.",2006,A phase III randomized study on the sequencing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the conservative management of early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare two different timings of radiation treatment in patients with breast cancer who underwent conservative surgery and were candidates to receive adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: A total of 206 patients who had quadrantectomy and axillary dissection for breast cancer and were planned to receive adjuvant CMF chemotherapy were randomized to concurrent or sequential radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered only to the whole breast through tangential fields to a dose of 50 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, followed by an electron boost of 10-15 Gy in 4-6 fractions to the tumor bed. Results: No differences in 5-year breast recurrence-free, metastasis-free, disease-free, and overall survival were observed in the two treatment groups. All patients completed the planned radiotherapy. No evidence of an increased risk of toxicity was observed between the two arms. No difference in radiotherapy and in the chemotherapy dose intensity was observed in the two groups. Conclusions: In patients with negative surgical margins receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be delayed to up to 7 months. Concurrent administration of CMF chemotherapy and radiotherapy is safe and might be reserved for patients at high risk of local recurrence, such as those with positive surgical margins or larger tumor diameters.

"Aref, A., et al.",2000,Dosimetric improvements following 3D planning of tangential breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the dosimetric difference between a simple radiation therapy plan utilizing a single contour and a more complex three-dimensional (3D) plan utilizing multiple contours, lung inhomogeneity correction, and dose-based compensators.Methods and Materials: This is a study of the radiation therapy (RT) plans of 85 patients with early breast cancer. All patients were considered for breast-conserving management and treated by conventional tangential fields technique. Two plans were generated for each patient. The first RT plan was based on a single contour taken at the central axis and utilized two wedges. The second RT plan was generated by using the 3D planning system to design dose-based compensators after lung inhomogeneity correction had been made. The endpoints of the study were the comparison between the volumes receiving greater than 105% and greater than 110% of the reference dose, as well as the magnitude of the treated volume maximum dose. Dosimetric improvement was defined to be of significant value if the volume receiving > 105% of one plan was reduced by at least 50% with the absolute difference between the volumes being 5% or greater. The dosimetric improvements in 49 3D plans (58%) were considered of significant value. Patients' field separation and breast size did not predict the magnitude of improvement in dosimetry.Conclusion: Dose-based compensator plans significantly reduced the volumes receiving > 105%, >110%, and volume maximum dose.

"Arimura, T., et al.",2017,Initial experience with the use of the hybis in a phase 1 clinical trial for early breast cancer using proton beams.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We developed a hybrid breast-immobilization system (HyBIS) that reproduced the manner and shape of the breast from the prone position in the supine position and reduced the influence of respiratory movement, and conducted a phase I clinical trial for early breast cancer with proton beams using the HyBIS. The aim of this study was to verify the feasibility, the accuracy and the reproducibility of the HyBIS in the trial. Purpose/Objective(s): Between June 2015 and May 2016, 4 patients with early breast cancer were treated with proton beams using the HyBIS in a phase I clinical study. The age range of the patients was 49-63 and the tumor size was all within 15mm in diameter. Two 5-mm-long VISICOILs (gold flexible linear fiducial marker) were inserted into the affected breast and were utilized for patient alignment. A 62.4 GyE of proton beams was irradiated in 26 fractions for GTV with a 15-mm margin, and a 46.8 GyE was administered for the surrounding mammary glands including the nipple-areolar region with a field-in-field technique. All patients underwent respiratory-gated computed tomography immediately after irradiation at inhale breathing status weekly, and the central positions of tumor and markers, and the entire figure of breast cup were determined. The treatment time per day since patients entered a treatment room until they left was measured to assess the feasibility of the HyBIS. We examined the correlation between the central positions of tumor and markers to verify the accuracy of HyBIS, and also evaluated the reproducibility of the HyBIS by analyzing the displacements for tumor of a three-dimensional space specified by skeletal structures, markers, and the entire figure of breast cup. Results: The average treatment time in each patient were 44, 39, 42, and 52 minutes, respectively, and shortening treatment time by accumulation of knowledge and experience was not observed. The mean values of the displacement of markers for tumor in each patient were 3.9±1.3, 2.0±0.7, 2.8±0.8, and 3.4±1.2 mm, respectively. The average values of the displacement for tumor of a three-dimensional space specified by skeletal structures, markers, and the entire figure of breast cup were 5.6±3.2, 4.6±2.7, and 3.8±2.3 mm, respectively. These results indicated that position displacement correction with breast cup in the treatment of early breast cancer with the HyBIS was more precise and reliable rather than those with skeletal structures or fiducial markers. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility, the accuracy, and the reproducibility of the HyBIS in the phase I clinical trial, and demonstrated that the HyBIS could help to reliably and precisely perform proton beam therapy for early breast cancer."
"Arimura, T., et al.",2016,A new breast-immobilization system for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): There is currently no guideline for breast immobilization in patients with early breast cancer undergoing high-precision radiotherapy. Irradiation of breast cancer in supine position would lead to a greater amount of damage to the lungs and heart. On the other hand, that in prone position might cause lower geometric accuracy of the target, as the breast is not secured. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new breastimmobilizing system that would incorporate the advantages of the different positions as well as increase fixation reliability by reducing the influence of respiratory movement. Materials/Methods: We developed the HYBIS (HYbrid Breast-Immobilization System) that consisted of a whole body immobilization system, position converting device (PCD) to change patient position, photo scanning system (PSS) to obtain breast data, breast cup made using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, breast cup fitting apparatus (BCFA), breast cup holding device to ensure the breast cup remained fixed in the supine position, and dedicated stretcher to carry the patient. We conducted a phantom experiment to evaluate the effect of the HYBIS on breast immobilization during the respiratory cycle. Thirteen markers were embedded in the right breast of a female phantom that simulated respiratory thoracic movement at an amplitude of 15 mm, and their displacements on four-dimensional computed tomography were compared between conditions with and without immobilization by HYBIS. Results: The phantom in the supine position was converted to the prone-lateral position with the PCD and was photographed with the PSS. The breast cup was produced by a 3D printer based on the obtained breast data (2D to 3D conversion) and was fit to the breast with the BCFA. After immobilization was thus applied with the HYBIS, breast protrusion was maintained in the phantom in the supine treatment position. The mean values of the anteroposterior, superoinferior, lateral, and three-dimensional (3D) displacement of the markers were 2.7-1.7, 0.3-0.5, 0.9-0.8, and 3.1-1.6 mm with HYBIS, and 5.5-2.9, 0.6-0.8, 0.5-0.4, and 5.6-2.9 mm without HYBIS, respectively; thus, the anteroposterior (PZ0.014) and 3D (PZ0.007) displacements significantly improved with HYBIS. As the breast cup grasped most of the breast skin and the whole breast was held securely away from the body, the movement of the thorax seemed to fail to propagate through the whole breast. Conclusion: We developed the new breast-immobilization system HYBIS and demonstrated that it could help retain the protruded breast shape in the supine position during treatment and could reduce the influence of respiratory movement. Thus, after a series of tryouts with female models, we finally initiated the clinical phase I study of proton beam therapy for early breast cancer."
"Arterbery, V.",2013,Total societal cost of care: Analysis of partial breast with APBI or IORT versus conventional versus accelerated external beam regimens for breast conservation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare cost to payers and physicians and to evaluate whether there are cost savings associated with alternate breast radiation techniques such as intraoperative radiation (IORT), whole breast accelerated radiation similar to Canadian regimens, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) when compared with the conventional external beam-based whole-breast RT with a boost (WBRT-B). Randomized and single institution studies in the US and Europe have shown equivalent local control with these radiation techniques used for breast conservation. Materials/Methods: Medicare reimbursement and treatment planning and delivery utilization data were modeled for 4 different breast RT techniques: (1) WBRT-B: 61.20 Gy in 34 fractions; (2) WBRT-accelerated (AC): 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions (3) (APBI) balloon based techniques: 34 Gy in 10 twicedaily fractions (4) (IORT) - intraoperative radiation at the time of breast surgery as only treatment. Costs incurred by payer (i.e., direct medical costs; 2012 Medicare Fee Schedule-MI) and patient (i.e., direct nonmedical costs; time and travel) were estimated. Total societal costs were then calculated for each treatment approach. Results: Reduction in overall treatment time does not guarantee a reduction in total cost savings to payers. The least expensive external beam radiation approach was the (AC) regimen using 16 fractions. Any reduced cost to patients for the HDR brachytherapy-based APBI regimens were overshadowed by substantial increases in cost to payers, resulting in higher total societal costs; the cost of HDR treatment delivery was primarily responsible for the increased direct medical cost. Overall, IORT was the least costly of all the regimens, in terms of costs to society and payers. The traditional APBI approach has the highest reimbursement to physicians over all other techniques. Physician reimbursement and direct medical cost) was greatest to least for APBI, then WBRT-B, AC and IORT respectively. Direct non medical costs to patient were ranked highest to lowest for WBRT-B, AC, WBRT-B and IORT in that order. Conclusions: Current reimbursement does not reflect societal cost considerations. If one were to pursue a partial-breast regimen to minimize patient and payer costs, it would be more advantageous from a societal perspective to pursue IORT. The current reimbursement does not fairly represent the physician work involved to deliver these accelerated treatments. These large discrepancies in physician payments discourage the use of more cost effective breast treatments. Given the equivalent outcomes of some of the accelerated regimens either APBI or IORT or accelerated fractionation (AC), consideration should be given to restructuring or bundling radiation payments for early stage breast cancer."
"Arterbery, V. and P. Johnson",2013,Accelerated partial breast irradiation with electronic brachytherapy for treatment of early stage breast cancer: Shortterm clinical and cosmetic results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Electronic brachytherapy is one of the recent balloon based techniques to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation for early stage breast cancer. Treatment involves the use of a 50 KV source, which avoids the need for specialized room shielding. Currently, there is limited clinical outcome data available for APBI treated with electronic brachytherapy, but the treatment delivery, technique and dose are similar to other balloon methods. We report observations and early results with this technique. Materials/Methods: We reviewed our clinical experiences with stage I breast cancer patients whose treatment plan included electronic brachytherapy with a 50 KV source. Twenty-five women with mean-age of 64 years with invasive and non-invasive breast carcinoma underwent treatment after surgical resection. Inclusion criteria were identical to our experience with other APBI methods. Patients with tumors <3 cm with negative sentinel lymph nodes were treated. Skin-to-balloon distance was 7 mm or greater. The plan of treatment included a lumpectomy, placement of a cavity-evaluation device at surgery in the majority of patients. Radiation treatment, delivered at 10 mm from the balloon surface in 10 fractions over 5 days for a total of 34 Gy, 3.4 Gy per fraction, each fraction separated by ≥ 6 hours. Results: Median follow-up at 1 year showed no recurrence of breast cancer. The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale used for reference to evaluate the cosmetic results. Cosmetic outcomes were excellent at 1-month interval 92% of patients, at 6 months 88% and 100% reported excellent cosmesis after 1 year. A minority of patients experienced mild erythema and seroma formation, which has also been observed when using other methods. Some patients with skin distance between 7 mm-10 mm had more skin related side effects. There is some concern about skin dose for patients with skin to balloon distance less than 10 mm due to the increased skin dose with the technique. Conclusions: Electronic brachytherapy techniques to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation for early stage breast cancer are effective and feasible treatments and similar to iridium based techniques, with excellent cosmetic results, at a short-term follow-up. Increase care with smaller skin to balloon distances (less than 10 mm) is needed due to the dose distribution effects of the 50 Kv source. The portability and ease of use of this cost-effective method is an added advantage."
"Arthur, D. W., et al.",2003,Partial breast brachytherapy after lumpectomy: Low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The use of partial breast brachytherapy (PBB) after lumpectomy for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer reduces the adjuvant radiotherapy treatment time to <1 week. Despite the advantages of accelerated treatment, maintaining an acceptable cosmetic outcome is important. In a cohort of patients who received low-dose-rate (LDR) or high-dose-rate (HDR) PBB after lumpectomy, the clinical characteristics and treatment parameters were analyzed to identify predictors for an unfavorable cosmetic outcome. Methods and Materials: Early-stage breast cancer patients with clear resection margins and 0-3 positive lymph nodes were eligible for PBB. Uniform guidelines for target definition and brachytherapy catheter placement were applied. The HDR PBB dose was 34 Gy in 10 fractions within 5 days, and the LDR dose was 45 Gy given at a rate of 50 cGy/h. The end points included incidence of radiation recall reaction, telangiectasias, and cosmetic-altering fibrosis. Results: Between 1995 and 2000, 44 patients with early-stage breast cancer received PBB without adjuvant external beam radiotherapy after lumpectomy (31 HDR PBB, 13 LDR PBB). After a median follow-up of 42 months (range 18-86), all patients remained locally controlled. The overall rate of good/excellent cosmetic outcome was 79.6% overall and 90% with HDR PBB. Radiation recall reactions occurred in 43% of patients (6 of 14) who received adriamycin. LDR PBB and adriamycin were significant predictors for late unfavorable cosmetic changes in univariate analysis (p = 0.003 and p = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: Although a high rate of local control and good/excellent cosmetic outcome is provided with HDR PBB, the risk of unfavorable cosmetic changes when treated with both LDR PBB and adriamycin is noteworthy. This suggests that HDR PBB is preferred in patients for whom adriamycin is indicated.  Inc."

W., et al.",2011,Six-year analysis of treatment-related toxicities by the American society of breast surgeons mammosite breast brachytherapy registry trial in patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): This report presents 6-year data on treatment related toxicities for patients enrolled on the American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite breast brachytherapy registry trial. Materials/Methods: One thousand four hundred forty patients (1449 cases) with early stage breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy were treated with the MammoSite device to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) (34 Gy in 3.4 Gy fractions). One thousand two hundred fifty-five case (87%) had invasive breast cancer (IBC) (median size = 10 mm) and 194 cases (13%) had DCIS (median size = 8 mm). Median follow-up was 59 months and 27.9% of patients have been followed for>6 years. Results: Forty-seven cases (3.2%) developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) for a 5-year actuarial rate of 3.56% (3.59% for IBC and 3.36% for DCIS). Breast seromas were reported in 28% of cases (35.5% of open cavity and 21.7% of closed cavity placements). Thirteen percent of these cases were symptomatic. Seventy-seven percent of seromas developed during the first year after treatment. One hundred seventy-two cases (11.9%) required drainage to correct. Chemotherapy and balloon fill . 50cc were associated with the development of symptomatic seromas. A total of 2.3% of patients developed fat necrosis (FN). The incidence of FN during years 1 and 2 were 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Seroma formation, breast infection, and A/B cup size were associated with the development of fat necrosis. One hundred thirty-eight infections (9.5%) were noted. Ninety-eight percent occurred during the first year after treatment. Chemotherapy and seroma formation were associated with the development of infections. Seventeen cases required surgery to correct. Conclusions: Treatment related toxicities 6 years after treatment with APBI using the MammoSite device are good and similar to those reported with other forms of APBI with similar follow-up."
"Arthur, D. W., et al.",2013,Contura Multi-Lumen Balloon breast brachytherapy catheter: Comparative dosimetric findings of a phase 4 trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Final dosimetric findings of a completed, multi-institutional phase 4 registry trial using the Contura Multi-Lumen Balloon (MLB) breast brachytherapy catheter to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients with early-stage breast cancer are presented. Methods and Materials: Three dosimetric plans with identical target coverage were generated for each patient for comparison: multilumen multidwell (MLMD); central-lumen multidwell (CLMD); and central-lumen single-dwell (CLSD) loading of the Contura catheter. For this study, a successful treatment plan achieved ideal dosimetric goals and included the following: ≥95% of the prescribed dose (PD) covering ≥95% of the target volume (TV); maximum skin dose ≤125% of the PD; maximum rib dose ≤145% of the PD; and V150 ≤50 cc and V200 ≤10 cc. Results: Between January 2008 and February 2011, 23 institutions participated. A total of 318 patients were available for dosimetric review. Using the Contura MLB, all dosimetric criteria were met in 78.93% of cases planned with MLMD versus 55.38% with the CLMD versus 37.66% with the CLSD (P≤.0001). Evaluating all patients with the full range of skin to balloon distance represented, median maximum skin dose was reduced by 12% and median maximum rib dose by 13.9% when using MLMD-based dosimetric plans compared to CLSD. The dosimetric benefit of MLMD was further demonstrated in the subgroup of patients where skin thickness was <5 mm, where MLMD use allowed a 38% reduction in median maximum skin dose over CLSD. For patients with rib distance <5 mm, the median maximum rib dose reduction was 27%. Conclusions: Use of the Contura MLB catheter produced statistically significant improvements in dosimetric capabilities between CLSD and CLMD treatments. This device approach demonstrates the ability not only to overcome the barriers of limited skin thickness and close rib proximity, but to consistently achieve a higher standard of dosimetric planning goals.

"Arya, R., et al.",2015,Exercise behavior and patient-reported outcomes in women with early breast cancer receiving locoregional radiation therapy.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Purpose: Radiation therapy is associated with acute treatment-related complications that can lead to decreased quality of life (QOL). Exercise has been shown in other cancer treatment settings to improve negative outcomes. We conducted a prospective pilot study to explore the association between exercise, patient-reported outcomes, and acute radiation therapy toxicities. Methods and materials: Women receiving curative breast radiation therapy were enrolled. Each patient completed an exercise behavior/QOL survey before or during the first week of treatment and again during the last week of treatment. Exercise behavior was quantified with the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (metabolic equivalent [MET] hours per week). Measurements to evaluate upper extremity lymphedema and shoulder range of motion were completed. Skin toxicity was assessed weekly. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using standardized questionnaires. Results: Forty-five patients were enrolled. Mean patient age was 54 (range, 28-73) years. Mean METs in the exercise cohort (<. 9 METs/wk) was 21 per week (range, 11-38, n = 14); 3 per week (range, 0-8, n = 25) in the nonexercise cohort (<. 9 METs/wk). Women in the exercise cohort showed improvements in treatment-induced quality of life and fatigue (not significant) despite more extensive surgical, medical, and radiation treatment. No differences in treatment-related toxicities, pain, or sleep scores were noted. Lymphedema was mild (<. 3 cm) in the entire patient cohort. Conclusions: The vast majority of current exercise oncology literature implicates physical activity as an independent predictor of QOL in cancer patients. Our study noted similar trends, but they were not statistically significant. This may be due to our finding that patient-reported outcomes with radiation therapy are relatively high compared with other treatment modalities and remain stable throughout treatment. Thus, it may be that radiation therapy has a limited impact on QOL in breast cancer patients. Exercise may be best used as a targeted therapy in patients at high risk for poor QOL or radiation-related toxicities at baseline."

"Ash, R. B.",2017,In vivo dosimetry for single fraction intraoperative electron radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with early stage breast cancer are offered adjuvant breast radiation to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This is usually in the form of whole breast radiation. Recent data shows that partial breast radiation may be appropriate in some patients with early stage disease. Partial breast radiation, in the form of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is one form of partial breast radiation. Little data has been published on in vivo dosimetry for IORT using electrons. We set out to prospectively measure the dose at three points within the tumor cavity using in vivo dosimeters (nanodots) for patients receiving single fraction IORT using electrons. Purpose/Objective(s): Eligible patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing breast conservation and single fraction IORT were assessed. Following lumpectomy and sentinel node evaluation, the tumor bed was prepared for IORT. A chest wall shield was placed with in-vivo dosimeters (nanodots) placed above and below the shield. The tumor bed was then approximated and intraoperative ultrasound was used to determine depth from top of tumor cavity to top of shield. A 3rd in-vivo dosimeter was placed on the surface of the tumor bed. After 2100 cGy was delivered, the dosimeters were retrieved and the three dose points recorded. Energies, cone size, cone angles and presence/absence of bolus were also recorded. Regression coefficient was used to determine dose as a function of the above factors. Results: Nanodots for a total of 136 patients were evaluated. Cone size ranged from 4.5-7.5 cm. The majority of cases (86%) used cone size >/= 5.0 cm. Energies used included 6 (54.4%), 9 (38.2%), and 12 (7.4%) Mev. 58% of cones used had 0 degree angle. The mean surface dose was 1983 cGy (range 1706-2321), the mean dose above the shield was 1396.7 (range 2.4-2702) and the mean dose below the shield was 34.66 (1.4-748.3). Using the regression coefficient, surface dose was dependent on energy and cone size (P= 0.26, 0.28 respectively) but not cone angle (p= 0.06). The dose above shield did not appear to be dependent on energy, cone size or angle, (p= 0.62, 0.21, 0.28 respectively). The dose below shield does not appear to be dependent on the cone size or angle (p= 0.21, 0.19), but is dependent on energy (p=0.0). Conclusion: Our data shows that surface dose and dose below shield is consistent. Surface dose appears to be dependent on energy and cone size while dose below the shield seems to be dependent on energy. Dose above the shield was quite variable and not dependent on either three factors. The variability may be due to various issues including shield placed below chest wall muscle, off centering of dosimeters and inaccurate measurement of depth to chest wall. The top of the shield may also not be an appropriate surrogate for the base of the tumor bed."
"Avant, A., et al.",2019,Impact of Reduction Mammoplasty on Cosmetic Outcomes and Delivery of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Reduction Mammoplasty as a Component of Breast-Conserving Surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) is the standard of care for whole breast radiotherapy administered as a component of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for early stage breast cancer. Cosmetic outcomes following HFRT in the setting of reduction mammoplasty (RM) are not well characterized. In this study, we report outcomes for HFRT following breast conserving Surgery (BCS) with RM in a cohort of early stage breast cancer patients with evaluation of cosmesis, surgical complication rate, time to radiotherapy start, and impact on delivery of lumpectomy cavity boost (LCB). Materials/Methods: Under an IRB-approved protocol, the records of 49 patients treated for AJCC 8th edition Stage 0-IIB breast cancer with HFRT following BCS with RM were reviewed. All patients received HFRT utilizing a tangent technique without regional nodal irradiation to a dose of 40.05 Gy, 42.56 Gy, or 42.72 Gy in 15-16 fractions. Thirty-two of 49 (65%) patients also received LCB (dose range 10-13.35 in 4-5 fractions). Patients were evaluated at follow-up as per the Harvard/NSABP/RTOG Breast Cosmesis grading scale, which was used routinely to assess patient cosmesis. Surgical complications were assessed and the time from surgery to radiation start was recorded. The impact of RM anatomy on the decision to include a LCB as a component of therapy was recorded. Chi square testing was used to assess differences in cosmesis according to delivery of LCB and presence of surgical complications. Results: All patients completed the prescribed treatment. The median age at diagnosis was 56. The median follow-up time was 396 days from date of diagnosis, and 177 days from the end of treatment. No local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period. At Last follow-up, patient cosmesis included excellent (n=36, 73%), good (n=8, 16%), fair (n=3, 6%), and poor (n=2, 4%) outcomes. Surgical complications or delayed wound healing was observed in 8 patients (16%). Among the patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy between surgery and HFRT, the median time from surgery to HFRT start was 49 days. No statistically significant difference in cosmesis was observed among patients who received a LCB versus those who did not (p=.958). Among 17 patients who did not receive a LCB, boost would have been given based on clinical risk features for 47% (8/17) of patients, but was not possible due to absence of a definable target following RM. Cosmesis was significantly worse among patients with post-operative complications (p=.012). Conclusion: RM with HFRT results in acceptable cosmetic outcomes and may be a reasonable option for selected patients as a component of BCT. Given the potential for RM to obscure a lumpectomy cavity boost target and/or delay time to treatment start, early multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended to aid appropriate selection of patients for RM with BCT."
"Azghadi, S., et al.",2015,Practice patterns of radiation field design for sentinel lymph node positive early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recent, high impact randomized trials have led to decreasing use of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in early stage breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN), leading to controversy surrounding radiation therapy (RT) coverage of the axilla. We investigate practice pattern variation among radiation oncologists in regional nodal coverage in different clinicopathologic scenarios and evaluate and use of prediction tools. Materials/Methods: A customized, web-based questionnaire was emailed to 983 community (n=617) and academic (n=366) radiation oncologists with breast cancer subspecialty practicing in the United States. The survey consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions evaluating general clinical preferences surrounding RT field design for patients with early stage breast cancer with a positive SLN and 7 case scenarios designed to investigate field design in the setting of specific clinical and pathologic risk factors. Nodal coverage was classified as standard tangents (ST), high tangents (HT), tangents and a supraclavicular field (TSC), or tangents and full axillary coverage (TFA). Results: One hundred forty-seven evaluable responses were received and analyzed, with a response rate of 15.0%. 12 (8.3%) of respondents report using completion ALND for patients with 1-3 positive SLN without extra capsular extension (ECE) and 66 (45.5%) perform ALND with 1-3 positive SLN with ECE. In cases with micro metastatic SLN, with no lymphovascular system invasion (LVSI), 115 (87.1%) used ST or HT. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy influenced RT field design for patients with a positive SLN without ECE, 64 (48.5%) using TSC or TFA treatment and 94 (70.7%) using TSC and TFA after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For macro metastatic SLN involvement, tumor size and multifocality impact RT fields, mostly TSC (45.27%) and TFA (45.66%) were used in comparison to micro metastatic in which mostly HT (43.61%) was used. Forty (27.8%) report using online predictive nomograms to predict further axillary involvement, with no difference between academic and community radiation oncologists (p=0.95). Conclusion: There is significant practice variation in RT field design for SNL positive patients when omitting a completion ALND, although most respondents cover the full axilla for high-risk pathologic features. Online prediction nomograms are used by a minority of practitioners to assist in clinical decision-making in this setting. (Table Presented)."
"Azoury, F. S., et al.",2011,3D-CRT for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI): Lessons learned from patients' evaluation in a phase II trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): APBI could be recommended out of clinical trial for specific early breast cancers population. Even though results regarding efficacy and toxicities are widely reported, few data is available concerning patients' evaluation of cosmetic results and adverse affects that could impact their quality of life (QOL). Here, cosmetic results and patients QOL have been assessed and reported after 3D-conformal APBI in a phase II trial. Materials/Methods: From October 2007 to September 2009, 30 early breast cancer patients were treated by APBI (40 Gy/ 10 fractions/ 5 days. Treatment was delivered with two minitangents and an “en face” electron field using 3D conformal radiotherapy. Treatment related toxicities and overall cosmetic results (CR) were assessed by both patients and physicians at each visit (1, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after APBI completion). Patients' evaluation included: breast color changes, edema, pain and fibrosis/ retraction. Objective physicians' assessment was prospectively recorded: early toxicities such as skin erythema, dry/moist desquamation; late skin and subcutaneous toxicities, such as telangiectasia and fat necrosis (FN). Patients also scored their treatment satisfaction. Results: Median follow-up was 27.7 months [12.6-35]. At time point M1 (one month); M12 (12 months) and M24 (24 months): Patients assessment: cosmetic results were excellent or good (EG) for 79; 79 and 76% of patients, respectively. None or mild fibrosis or breast retraction were noticed for 68; 79 and 75% of patients, respectively. None or mild edema was observed for 84; 100 and 96% of patients, respectively; and none or mild breast color changes for 71; 86 and 92%, respectively. Moderate pain was mostly reported for 20; 14 and 32% of patients, respectively. Patients considered to be completely satisfied by APBI treatment and its results for 96; 100 and 96% of them, respectively. Physician's assessment: in contrast, excellent and good cosmetic results were always overestimated compared to patients' assessment (92; 90 and 92%, respectively). None or mild fibrosis or breast retraction were observed for 100; 93 and 92% of patients, respectively. None or mild edema was observed for 96; 100 and 100% of patients, respectively; and none or mild breast color changes for 64; 100 and 100%, respectively. Moderate pain was mostly reported for 12; 17 and 21% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: The present study shows that APBI using 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy is well accepted by most of breast cancer patients (>95% of them) whatever cosmetic results and symptoms related to APBI side effects. Objective physician assessment clearly underestimated patients' symptoms especially pain."
"Azria, D., et al.",2011,Concurrent or sequential adjuvant letrozole and radiotherapy after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer: Long-term results of the cohort phase 2 randomized trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Letrozole radiosensitizes breast cancer cells in vitro. In clinical settings, no data exist for the combination of letrozole and radiotherapy. We assessed concurrent and sequential radiotherapy and letrozole in the adjuvant setting. Materials/Methods: The present study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00208273. This Phase 2 randomized trial was undertaken in two centers in France and one in Switzerland between January 12, 2005, and February 21, 2007. One hundred fifty postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned after conserving surgery to either concurrent radiotherapy and letrozole (n = 75) or sequential radiotherapy and letrozole (n = 75). Randomization was open label with a minimization technique, stratified by investigational centers, chemotherapy (yes vs. no), radiation boost (yes vs. no), and value of radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis (≤16% vs. >16%). The whole breast was irradiated to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. In the case of supraclavicular and internal mammary node irradiation, the dose was 44 - 50 Gy. Letrozole was administered orally once daily at a dose of 2 - 5 mg for 5 years (beginning 3 weeks pre-radiotherapy in the concomitant group, and 3 weeks postradiotherapy in the sequential group). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of acute (during and within 6 weeks of radiotherapy) and late (within 2 years) radiation-induced Grade 2 or worse toxic effects of the skin and lung (functional pulmonary test and lung CT-scan). Analyses were by intention-to-treat. The long-term follow-up after 2 years was only performed in Montpellier (n = 121) and evaluated skin toxicity (clinical examination every 6 months), lung fibrosis (one CT-scan yearly), cosmetic outcome. Results: All patients were analyzed apart from 1 in the concurrent group who withdrew consent before any treatment.Within the first 2 years (n = 149), no lung toxicity was identified by CT scan and no modification from baseline was noted by the lung diffusion capacity test. Two patients in each group had Grade 2 or worse late effects (both radiation-induced subcutaneous fibrosis [RISF]). After 2 years (n = 121), and with a median follow-up of 50 months (38-62), 2 patients (1 in each arm) presented a Grade 3 RISF. No lung toxicity was identified by CT scan. Cosmetic results (photographies) and quality of life was good to excellent. All patients who had Grade 3 subcutaneous fibrosis had an RILA value of 16% or less, irrespective of the sequence with letrozole. Conclusions:With long-term follow-up, letrozole can be safely delivered shortly after surgery and concomitantly with radiotherapy."

The single-lumen MammoSite device was used to deliver adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI; 34 Gy in 3.4 Gy fractions). One thousand two hundred fifty-five cases (87%) had invasive breast cancer (IBC) and 194 cases had DCIS.

Results: Forty-one cases (2.8%) developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) for a five-year actuarial rate of 3.8% (3.7% for IBC and 4.1% for DCIS). Tumor size (OR = 1.1; p = 0.03) and estrogen receptor negativity (OR=3.0; p=0.0009) were associated with increased rates of IBTR while a trend was noted for positive margins (OR = 2.0; p = 0.06) and cautionary/unsuitable status compared with suitable status (OR = 1.8; p= 0.07). The percentage of patients with excellent/good cosmetic results at 60, 72, and 84 months was 91.3%, 90.5%, and 90.6%, respectively. The overall rates of fat necrosis and infections remained low at 2.5% and 9.6% with few late toxicity events beyond 2-years. The overall symptomatic seroma rate was 13.4% at any time and 0.6% beyond 2-years. Conclusions: The final analysis of treatment efficacy, cosmesis and toxicity from the ASBS MammoSite Registry trial confirms previously noted excellent results, and compares favorably with other forms of APBI, and to outcomes seen in selected patients treated with whole breast irradiation."
"Baeza, M. R., et al.",1988,Conservative treatment of early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"At our institution, the treatment policy for early carcinoma of the breast (T1-2, NO, AJC) is lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy to the breast and peripheral lymphatics. From October 1976 until December 1982, 171 patients have been admitted and treated. Radiotherapy was administered with 60 Co, 5.000 cGy in 5 weeks to the breast and lymphatics plus a boost to the scar giving q.s.p. 6.400 cGy at maximum tumor depth. With a minimum follow-up of 3 years and a median follow-up of 61.7 months the locoregional control was 94.2% and survival at 8 years with no evidence of disease (NED) was 77.2% with and overall survival rate of 90%. No difference in NED survival rate was found between Stage I and II. There was a tendency to better survival rate in those patients older than 50 years and also for postmenopausal patients, however the difference did not reach statistical significance (66.7% NED survival at 8 years for premenopausal and 81.8% NED survival for postmenopausal, also at 8 years, p = 0.056 Gehan). The time elapsed between surgery and radiation therapy (between 1 and 2 months) was found to be nonsignificant. Only 1 out of 171 patients has had axillary dissection. The importance or lack of it, is discussed."
"Baglan, K. L., et al.",2001,The use of high-dose-rate brachytherapy alone after lumpectomy in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present the preliminary results of our in-house protocol using outpatient high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality following lumpectomy in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Thirty-seven patients with 38 Stage I-II breast cancers received radiation to the lumpectomy cavity alone using an HDR interstitial implant with 192Ir. A minimum dose of 32 Gy was delivered on an outpatient basis in 8 fractions of 4 Gy to the lumpectomy cavity plus a 1- to 2-cm margin over consecutive 4 days. Results: Median follow-up is 31 months. There has been one ipsilateral breast recurrence for a crude failure rate of 2.6% and no regional or distant failures. Wound healing was not impaired in patients undergoing an open-cavity implant. Three minor breast infections occurred, and all resolved with oral antibiotics. The cosmetic outcome was good to excellent in all patients. Conclusion: In selected patients with early-stage breast cancer, treatment of the lumpectomy cavity alone with outpatient HDR brachytherapy is both technically feasible and well tolerated. Early results are encouraging, however, longer follow-up is necessary before equivalence to standard whole-breast irradiation can be established and to determine the most optimal radiation therapy technique to be employed.

"Bantema-Joppe, E. J., et al.",2011,Early-stage young breast cancer patients: Impact of local treatment on survival.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: In young women, breast-conserving therapy (BCT), i.e., lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy, has been associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. Still, there is insufficient evidence that BCT impairs survival. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of BCT with mastectomy on overall survival (OS) in young women with early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: From two Dutch regional population-based cancer registries (covering 6.2 million inhabitants) 1,453 women <40 years with pathologically T1N0-1M0 breast cancer were selected. Cox regression survival analysis was used to study the effect of local treatment (BCT vs. mastectomy) stratified for nodal stage on survival and corrected for tumor size, age, period of diagnosis, and use of adjuvant systemic therapy. Results: With a median follow-up of 9.6 years, 10-year OS was 83% after BCT and 78% after mastectomy, respectively (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.72). In N0-patients, 10-year OS was 84% after BCT and 81% after mastectomy and local treatment was not associated with differences in OS (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89-1.58; p = 0.25). Within the N1-patient group, OS was better after BCT compared with mastectomy, 79% vs. 71% at 10 years (HR 1.91; 95% CI, 1.28-2.84; p = 0.001) and in patients treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy (HR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18-0.66; p = 0.001). Conclusions: In this large population-based cohort of early-stage young breast cancer patients, 10-year OS was not impaired after BCT compared with mastectomy. Patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes had better prognosis after BCT than after mastectomy.  Inc."
"Bar Ad, V., et al.",2010,Time Course of Mild Arm Lymphedema After Breast Conservation Treatment for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Arm lymphedema is a potential consequence of the treatment for breast carcinoma. The objective of this retrospective study was to characterize the progression of mild arm lymphedema after breast conservation treatment for breast cancer. Methods and Materials: The study cohort was drawn from 1,713 consecutive Stage I or II breast cancer patients who underwent breast conservation therapy, including axillary staging followed by radiation. Arm lymphedema was documented in 266 (16%) of 1,713 patients. One hundred nine patients, 6% of the overall group and 40% of the patients with arm lymphedema, presented with mild arm lymphedema, defined as a difference of 2 cm or less between the measured circumferences of the affected and unaffected arms. Results: Among the 109 patients with mild arm lymphedema at the time of arm lymphedema diagnosis, the rate of freedom from progression to more severe lymphedema was 79% at 1 year, 66% at 3 years, and 52% at 5 years. The patients who were morbidly obese, had positive axillary lymph nodes, or received supraclavicular irradiation at the time of breast cancer treatment were at higher risk of progression from mild arm lymphedema to more severe edema. Conclusions: Mild arm lymphedema, generally considered to be a minor complication after breast conservation treatment for breast cancer, was associated with a risk of progression to a more severe grade of arm lymphedema in a substantial fraction of patients.

"Barnett, G. C., et al.",2012,Randomized controlled trial of forward-planned intensity modulated radiotherapy for early breast cancer: Interim results at 2 years.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This single-center randomized trial was designed to investigate whether intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) reduces late toxicity in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: The standard tangential plans of 1,145 nonselected patients were analyzed. The patients with inhomogeneous plans were randomized to a simple method of forward-planned IMRT or standard radiotherapy (RT). The primary endpoint was serial photographic assessment of breast shrinkage. Results: At 2 years, no significant difference was found in the development of any photographically assessed breast shrinkage between the patients randomized to the interventional or control group (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.58; p =.41). The patients in the control group were more likely to develop telangiectasia than those in the IMRT group (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.40; p =.009). Poor baseline surgical cosmesis resulted in poor overall cosmesis at 2 years after RT. In patients who had good surgical cosmesis, those randomized to IMRT were less likely to deteriorate to a moderate or poor overall cosmesis than those in the control group (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.03, p =.061). Conclusions: IMRT can lead to a significant reduction in telangiectasia at comparatively early follow-up of only 2 years after RT completion. An important component of breast induration and shrinkage will actually result from the surgery and not from the RT. Surgical cosmesis is an important determinant of overall cosmesis and could partially mask the longer term benefits of IMRT at this early stage.  Inc."
"Beadle, G. F., et al.",1984,The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on the cosmetic results after primary radiation treatment for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Breast cancer patients treated by primary radiation therapy who have positive axillary lymph nodes now typically receive adjuvant chemotherapy. In order to evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on the response of the breast to radiation treatment, we compared the cosmetic results of 49 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and 206 patients nor treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. A variety of chemotherapy regimens were employed, most commonly a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). The median follow-up time for all patients was 33 months. Cosmetic results were scored by the physician at each follow-up evaluation as excellent, good, and fair or poor, depending on the presence and extent of radiation-related changes in the treated breast. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were less likely to have an excellent overall cosmetic result than patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. At 24 months 24% of these patients had an excellent cosmetic result compared with 64% of patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.0002). This difference was due primarily to a shift in chemotherapy-treated patients from an excellent to a good overall cosmetic result. Breast retraction was noted to be the most frequent determinant of a fair or poor cosmetic result and was more common in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. At 24 months, 62% of these patients had evidence of breast retraction compared with 44% of patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.06). We conclude from this preliminary analysis that adjuvant chemotherapy modifies the response of the breast to radiation, most notably by increasing the development of retraction."
"Beal, K., et al.",2007,Single-Fraction Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer: Early Cosmetic Results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the cosmetic outcome of patients treated with wide local excision and intraoperative radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A total of 50 women were treated on a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of intraoperative radiotherapy at wide local excision. The eligibility criteria included age >60, tumor size ≤2.0 cm, clinically negative lymph nodes, and biopsy-established diagnosis. After wide local excision, a custom breast applicator was placed in the excision cavity, and a dose of 20 Gy was prescribed to a depth of 1 cm. After 18 patients were treated, the dose was constrained laterally to 18 Gy. The cosmetic outcome was evaluated by photographs at baseline and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Four examiners graded the photographs for symmetry, edema, discoloration, contour, and scarring. The grades were evaluated in relationship to the volume of irradiated tissue, tumor location, and dose at the lateral aspects of the cavity. Results: The median volume of tissue receiving 100% of the prescription dose was 47 cm3 (range, 20-97 cm3). Patients with ≤47 cm3 of treated tissue had better cosmetic outcomes than did the women who had >47 cm3 of treated tissue. Women who had received 18 Gy at the lateral aspects of their cavities had better cosmetic outcomes than did women who had received 20 Gy at the lateral aspects. When comparing the 6- and 12-month results, the scores remained stable for 63%, improved for 17%, and worsened for 20%. Conclusion: Intraoperative radiotherapy appears feasible for selected patients. A favorable cosmetic outcome appears to be related to a smaller treatment volume. The cosmetic outcome is acceptable, although additional follow-up is necessary.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Beal, K., et al.",2011,Five year update on intraoperative radiation therapy for breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the long term outcome of patients treated with wide local excision (WLE) and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Fifty-two women with early stage invasive breast cancer were treated on a pilot study at our center to evaluate the feasibility of IORT given in 1 fraction at the time of wide local excision. Eligibility criteria included age.60, tumor size <2.0cm, clinically negative lymph nodes, no clinical or radiographic evidence of multicentricity, and biopsy established diagnosis. The median age was 67 years (range: 45-87). After WLE, a custom sized modified HAM applicator was placed in the excision cavity and a dose of 20 Gy was prescribed to a depth of 1 cmof breast tissue in all directions except the deep margin where it was prescribed to 5mm. After 18 patients were treated, the technique was changed so that the lateral aspects of the cavity received 18 Gy at 1 cm. Following IORT 3 patients received chemotherapy and 29 received hormone therapy. Following IORT patients were followed with annual mammography and routine physical examinations every 3-4 months for 1 year and then every 4-6 months to date. Results: The median follow up was 68 months (range: 3-95). At time of analysis 45 (87%) patients were alive and 7 (13%) were deceased of causes unrelated to their breast cancer. The 5 year overall survival was 86% and the 5 year local control rate was 93%. 4 patients had local recurrences in the treated breast; 3 were discovered on routine MMG and 1 had a non-healing wound biopsy; on original pathology at time of IORT 1 had positive margins, 2 had close margins, and 1 had high grade disease with extensive lymphovascular invasion extending to the margin. 1 patient refused further therapy due to advanced age (88 years) and 3 were managed with mastectomy and are now without evidence of disease. No patients developed distant metastases. Prior to their breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, 8 women had other cancers, 3 of whom had 2 prior cancers (3 contralateral breast, 3 colon, 2 endometrial, 1 lymphoma, 1 ovarian, 1 renal cell). After IORT 7 women developed other cancers (3 lung, 2 endometrial, 2 pancreatic); the median age at time of 2nd cancer diagnosis was 82 years (range 67-87). The cosmetic results as described in a prior study remained stable or improved. Conclusions: In this pilot study of IORT for breast cancer, the local control was good with local failures limited to patients who had close or positive margins. This form of accelerated partial breast radiation is feasible, logistically very convenient, and well tolerated for this group of patients who are advanced in age and who have multiple medical co-morbidities. The rate of other cancers in this group of patients is somewhat high and underscores the importance of screening studies for patients with a previous cancer diagnosis."
"Beaton, L. E., et al.",2016,Do women who died of cardiac disease within 10 years of breast or chest wall radiation therapy violate the “QUANTEC” cardiac dose-volume histogram guidelines?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast and chest wall irradiation (RT) increase the risk of cardiac death. This increased risk is presumed to be a result of the incidental exposure of the heart to radiation. Previous studies have focused on mean heart dose as a measure of radiation exposure. In the modern era of CT based radiation therapy planning, international guidelines (“QUANTEC”) state that for partial heart irradiation a “V25 Gy < 10% (2 Gy/fraction) will be associated with a less than 1% probability of cardiac mortality” in long term follow-up after radiation therapy. We therefore set out to establish whether or not women who died of cardiac disease within 10 years of breast or chest wall radiotherapy had radiation therapy plans that violated these guidelines. We also assessed the maximum dose of radiation delivered to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and cardiac volume parameters in these patients, on the assumption that the LAD is the critical structure for RT induced cardiac events. Materials/Methods: A provincial database was used to identify all women under 80 years of age diagnosed with early stage breast cancer who were treated with adjuvant RT to the breast or chest wall between 2002 and 2006, who died of cardiac disease. The heart and LAD were retrospectively delineated using a peer-reviewed cardiac atlas. A 1cm radial margin was placed around the LAD to create a planning organ at risk volume (PRV). For each dose plan, DVH's for the heart and LAD were calculated and the V25 compared to the current QUANTEC guidelines. Results: Between RT start date and June 2015, 76 patients died of a cardiovascular event after breast or chest wall RT. 42 of these patients received left-sided irradiation, and 34 right-sided irradiation. For the left sided cases, median time from diagnosis to death was 6.7 years. Later cardiac deaths (more than 9 years after diagnosis) were more common for left-sided cases when compared to right-sided cases (38% vs 24%).Radiation therapy plans were available for 31 of the left-sided cases. 11 cases were treated without CT planning. 19 patients received radiation doses of 40-42.56 Gy over 16 fractions, and 12 patients doses of 45-50.4 Gy over 25-28 fractions. The heart V25 did not exceed 10% in any of our 31 left sided cases. Equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2) were calculated from the DVH using a/b 2 Gy. The average maximum heart dose was 35.6 Gy (SD 16.1). The average maximum dose to the LAD was 26.2 Gy (SD 19.7) and 40.9 Gy (SD 15.6) to the LAD PRV. Conclusion: This study has shown that the QUANTEC guidelines were not violated in our cohort of patients that died of cardiac disease after leftsided breast RT. As only 38% of patients died later than 9 years after radiation therapy it may be that pre-existing cardiac risk factors were a dominant factor for cardiac death as opposed to the effect of RT. It remains unclear as to the exact mechanism of increased cardiac mortality as a result of RT, but radiation to the LAD may be more important than the heart V25 in predicting cardiac mortality."
"Beitsch, P. D., et al.",2011,The american society of breast surgery mammosite registry: Factors associated with optimal longterm cosmetic results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate factors associated with optimal cosmetic results at 72 months for early-stage breast cancer patients treated with single lumen MammoSite balloon based adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Materials/Methods: One thousand four hundred forty patients (1,449 cases) with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breastconserving therapy were treated with the single lumen MammoSite balloon based brachytherapy to deliver APBI (34 Gy in 3.4- Gy fractions). Cosmetic outcome was evaluated at each follow-up visit and dichotomized as excellent/good (E/G) or fair/poor (F/ P). Follow-up was evaluated at 36 and 72 months to establish long-term cosmesis, stability and factors associated with optimal results. Results: The percentage of evaluable patients with good/excellent (E/G) cosmetic results at 36, and ≥72 months were 93.3% (n = 708/759) and 90.4% (n = 235/260). Factors associated with optimal cosmetic results at 72 months included: larger skin spacing (p = 0.0366) and T1 tumors (p = 0.0197). Using multiple regression analysis, the only factors predictive of worse cosmetic outcome at 72 months were smaller skin spacing [odds ratio (OR) 0.89, confidence interval (CI) 0.80, 0.99] and T2 tumors [odds ratio (OR) 4.96, confidence interval (CI) 1.532, 16.07] 227 patients had both a 36 and 72 month cosmetic evaluation. The number of patients with E/G cosmetic results decreased only slightly from 93.4% at 3 years to 90.8% (p = 0.1336) at 6 years, respectively. Conclusions: APBI delivered with single lumen MammoSite balloon based brachytherapy produced E/G cosmetic results in 90.4% of cases at 6-years. Larger tumors (T2) and skin spacing were found to be the two most important independent predictors of cosmesis."
"Benk, V., et al.",1998,Predictors of delay in starting radiation treatment for patients with early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To describe the factors predicting waiting time for radiation treatment in early breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Between January 1992 and December 1993, 739 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer were treated with conservative treatment at three McGill University Hospitals. Waiting time was defined as the interval between the date of surgery and the date of the first radiation treatment. Delay was defined as a waiting time of more than 7 weeks for women who did not receive chemotherapy (Group NC, n = 478), and as a waiting time of more than 24 weeks for those who received chemotherapy (Group C, n = 261). We analyzed predictive factors related to the patient (age, stage, treatment on protocol, income by postal code) and to the referring hospital (university or community hospital). Results: For the entire population, 54% of patients were delayed, 72% in Group NC and 21.4% in Group C. Univariate analysis showed an impact of referring hospital in both groups, and of stage and treatment on protocol in Group C (all p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that delays were significantly less in Group NC for women referred from a community hospital (p = 0.001) and in Group C for women with Stage I disease (p = 0.06), those treated on protocol, and those referred from a university hospital (p = 0.001). Conclusion: More than half of patients with early breast cancer waited more than the recommended intervals for radiation therapy. However, lower income breast cancer patients did not wait longer for treatment than higher income patients, possibly a result of the Canadian Medicare system which provides universal access to health care."
"Benson, J. R., et al.",2009,Early breast cancer.,The Lancet,"Adoption of urbanised lifestyles together with changes in reproductive behaviour might partly underlie the continued rise in worldwide incidence of breast cancer. Widespread mammographic screening and effective systemic therapies have led to a stage shift at presentation and mortality reductions in the past two decades. Loco-regional control of the disease seems to affect long-term survival, and attention to surgical margins together with improved radiotherapy techniques could further contribute to mortality gains. Developments in oncoplastic surgery and partial-breast reconstruction have improved cosmetic outcomes after breast-conservation surgery. Optimum approaches for delivering chest-wall radiotherapy in the context of immediate breast reconstruction present special challenges. Accurate methods for intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes remain a clinical priority. Clinical trials are investigating combinatorial therapies that use novel agents targeting growth factor receptors, signal transduction pathways, and tumour angiogenesis. Gene-expression profiling offers the potential to provide accurate prognostic and predictive information, with selection of best possible therapy for individuals and avoidance of overtreatment and undertreatment of patients with conventional chemotherapy. Short-term presurgical studies in the neoadjuvant setting allow monitoring of proliferative indices, and changes in gene-expression patterns can be predictive of response to therapies and long-term outcome."
"Bergom, C., et al.",2014,Does size matter: Examining the association of BMI with breast cancer recurrence and survival in an early stage breast cancer cohort with a high median BMI.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): High body mass index (BMI) or obesity and dysregulated glucose metabolism have been identified as risk factors for distant recurrence and decreased survival in breast cancer. Our institution aimed to determine whether BMI and/or diabetic status correlated with local recurrence and reduced survival in a cohort of predominantly obese women, as measured by BMI, treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT). Materials/Methods: From 1998-2006, 119 women with early stage invasive breast cancer were treated with prone whole breast irradiation (WBI) using 3D conformal radiation. A retrospective review was performed examining BMI and diabetic status at diagnosis. The association of BMI and crude recurrence rates was examined using Fisher's Exact test. The association of BMI and diabetes with local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) was examined using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: The median age was 60 years. Median follow-up was 90 months. Seventy-five percent of patients were post-menopausal. Mean tumor size was 1.5 cm. Nodal disease (N1) was present in 16%, and 78% of patients with invasive disease were ER/PR+. Appropriate systemic therapy was recommended to all patients. Median BMI was 33.5 (mean 34.6); 90% were overweight (BMI ≥ 25), 71% of patients were clinically obese (BMI ≥ 30), and 37% had ≥ WHO class II obesity (BMI ≥ 35). Twelve patients had diabetes (10%). For the cohort, 5-year LRFS, DMFS, and OS were 93%, 94%, and 91%, respectively. Diabetes was not associated with cancer progression or recurrence. The crude recurrence rate for those with greater than the median BMI (33.5) was 9.4%, versus 0% for those with BMI less than the median value (p = 0.013). BMI was significantly associated with decreased DMFS (HR= 1.14, p= 0.011), RFS (HR = 1.13, p = 0.008), DFS (HR = 1.16, p < 0.0001), and OS (HR = 1.10, p = 0.004), and there was a trend for increased local regional recurrence with higher BMI (p = 0.08). Diabetic status did not correlate with breast cancer related outcomes. On multivariate analysis, adjusting for tumor size, subtype, grade, age, nodal involvement, chemotherapy, and diabetes, BMI remained a significant predictor of poorer RFS (p=0.01), DFS (p=0.001), DMFS (p = 0.01), and OS (p = 0.0009). Conclusions: In this cohort of early stage breast cancer patients with high BMI, increasing BMI predicted for worse RFS, DFS, DMFS, and OS. In addition, this data suggests that BMI may impact the rate of local recurrence, warranting investigation in larger cohorts of patients. This investigation adds to growing evidence that BMI is an important prognostic factor in early stage breast cancer treated with BCT."
"Bergom, C., et al.",2016,Association of Locoregional Control With High Body Mass Index in Women Undergoing Breast Conservation Therapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Obesity, as measured by the body mass index (BMI), is a risk factor for distant recurrence and decreased survival in breast cancer. We sought to determine whether the BMI correlated with local recurrence and reduced survival in a cohort of predominantly obese women treated with breast conservation therapy. Methods and Materials From 1998 to 2010, 154 women with early-stage invasive breast cancer and 39 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ underwent prone whole breast irradiation. Cox proportional hazards regression, Kaplan-Meier methods with the log-rank test, and multivariate analysis were used to explore the association of the outcomes with the BMI. Results The median patient age was 60 years, and the median follow-up duration was 73 months. The median BMI was 33.2 kg/m2; 91% of the patients were overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) and 69% of the patients were clinically obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). The BMI was significantly associated with the locoregional recurrence-free interval for patients with invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; P=.047). Also, a trend was seen for increased locoregional recurrence with a higher BMI (P=.09) for patients with invasive disease, which was significant when examining the outcomes with a BMI stratified by the median value of 33.2 kg/m2 (P=.008). A greater BMI was also significantly associated with decreased distant recurrence-free interval (HR, 1.09; P=.011) and overall survival (HR, 1.09; P=.004); this association remained on multivariate analysis (distant recurrence-free interval, P=.034; overall survival, P=.0007). Conclusions These data suggest that the BMI might affect the rate of locoregional recurrence in breast cancer patients. A higher BMI predicted a worse distant recurrence-free interval and overall survival. The present investigation adds to the increasing evidence that BMI is an important prognostic factor in early-stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy."

Conclusions: In this cohort of early stage breast cancer patients with high BMI, increasing BMI predicted for worse PFS, DFS, DMFS, and OS. In addition, there is a suggestion that BMI impacts the rate of local recurrence that warrants investigation in larger cohorts of patients. This investigation adds to growing evidence that BMI is an important prognostic factor in early stage breast cancer treated with BCT."
"Berlin, E., et al.",2018,Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) breast cancer treated with 3-week accelerated hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy and concomitant boost.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Introduction: Randomized trials on early stage invasive breast cancer suggest that accelerated hypofractionated RT is an effective therapeutic alternative to the protracted 6-7 week therapy. In these trials, however, patients diagnosed with DCIS were not routinely included. Ongoing trials seek to establish optimal hypofractionation schedules for treating DCIS patients. There has also been recent data that illustrated the benefit of lumpectomy bed boost in patients with DCIS [1]. In this study, we sought to evaluate the outcomes for patients diagnosed with DCIS treated using accelerated whole breast RT and concomitant lumpectomy boost following breast conserving surgery. Methods: This is a prospective institutional review board-approved study. Eligibility included stage Tis, N0, M0 breast cancer. Following breast conserving surgery with negative margins patients received whole breast RT to a dose of 40.5Gy in 2.7Gy fractions and a concomitant boost of 4.5 Gy in 0.3-Gy fractions. Accordingly, whole breast dose of 40.5Gy and the lumpectomy site dose of 45Gy was delivered in 15 fractions. Patients were followed at regular intervals with breast imaging and physical examination by the multidisciplinary team. Results: 109 patients were treated on protocol. In this paper we report on 103 patients who have a minimum of 12 month follow up after diagnosis. The median follow up period was 65.5 months (range 12-146 months) with 84.0% having a follow up period of ≥36 months. The median age was 58.5 years (range, 37-85 years). 39.6% had nuclear grade 3 lesion. The receptor status was available in 100 patients. Among them, 91% the carcinoma was estrogen receptor positive and in 81% the carcinoma was progesterone receptor positive. Following RT, 40.6% received antiestrogen therapy. The CTCAE v4.0 grade 1 and 2 skin toxicity was observed in 66.0% and 3.8% respectively. No patients were observed with grade 3 skin toxicity. In follow up all patients remain alive and without evidence of recurrence. Conclusions: The prescribed accelerated schedule of whole-breast radiation therapy for patients with DCIS to date shows consistent results with minimal skin toxicity, excellent local control and survival. Accelerated hypofractionated treatment with concomitant boost appears to be reasonable schedule for patients with DCIS."
"Bernard, A. A., et al.",2019,Dosimetric Comparison of HDR Brachytherapy and VMAT for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation is an option for some early stage breast cancer patients. The rationale of APBI consists of irradiating only the lumpectomy cavity and a margin that defines a volume where about 95% of the recurrence occurs after surgery. A smaller treated volume means a higher achievable dose per fraction and fewer fractions for a treatment with similar tumor control and toxicity rates. Its utilisation is increasing and a variety of technics can be used. The objective of this study is to compare the dosimetry of APBI plans delivered by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Materials/Methods: Twelve patients treated with brachytherapy were retrieved from our database. Eight patients were treated by APBI and received 33 Gy in 9 fractions BID (prescribed at V95≥5 %). Four patients received a boost as part of their treatment and their plans were adjusted to match the APBI prescription. All patients had a pre-implantation CT scan which was used to create VMAT plans following the OPAR protocol. The 30 Gy in 5 fractions prescription dose (prescribed at D100≥95%) was used to yield a biological equivalent dose similar to the HDR prescription. The t-test was used to compare HDR and VMAT dose distributions in terms of Dmax, Dmin, Dmean, and Vdose to targets and organs at risk. Results: Firstly, the cavity’s volumes were similar (VmeanVMAT=17.38±23.95 cc; VmeanHDR=18.40±20.13 cc) but not the CTV (VmeanVMAT=74.45±71.04 cc; VmeanHDR=18.40±20.13 cc). The HDR offers a higher cavity Dmean (DmeanVMAT=30.2±0.4 Gy; DmeanHDR=44.6±3.5 Gy). Small differences (p<0.001) were observed to the conformity index (CIVMAT=1.19±0.07; CIHDR=1.12±0.12), the ipsilateral lung V30 (V30VMAT=5.3±3.5 %; V30HDR=1.2±1.5 %) the contralateral breast Dmax (DmaxVMAT=0.622±0.236 Gy; DmaxHDR=0.246±0.163 Gy), and the heart Dmean (DmeanVMAT=0.433±0.193 Gy; DmeanHDR=0.624±0.355 Gy). No statistical difference were found in the dose to the contralateral lung, the contralateral breast Dmean (DmeanVMAT=0.141±0.063 Gy; DmeanHDR=0.047±0.029 Gy), the ipsilateral lung V10 (V10VMAT=12.8±5.6 %; V10HDR=12.7±9.3 %) and the heart Dmax (DmaxVMAT=0.472±0.633 Gy; DmaxHDR=0.324±0.280 Gy). Conclusion: Comparing VMAT and HDR APBI plans is complex due to their intrinsic differences, such as the prescription of the dose. That and the small number of patients included limit the conclusions that can be draw from our data. With that in mind, in this study, HDR brachytherapy allowed a higher dose at the cavity while effectively sparing OAR. Tough, both techniques offer a safe treatment, an adequate dose to the cavity and doses to the OAR well below the constraints, with minor dosimetric differences. Those nuances can guide the choice of a method to use for a specific patient considering some particularities such as the tumor location, the patient’s comorbidities, previous irradiation and the preference of the patient."
"Berrang, T. S., et al.",2011,Three-year outcomes of a Canadian multicenter study of accelerated partial breast irradiation using conformal radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To report 3-year toxicity, cosmesis, and efficacy of a multicenter study of external beam, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Between March 2005 and August 2006, 127 women aged ≥40 years with ductal carcinoma in situ or node-negative invasive breast cancer ≤3 cm in diameter, treated with breast-conserving surgery achieving negative margins, were accrued to a prospective study involving five Canadian cancer centers. Women meeting predefined dose constraints were treated with APBI using 3 to 5 photon beams, delivering 35 to 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions, twice a day, over 1 week. Patients were assessed for treatment-related toxicities, cosmesis, and efficacy before APBI and at specified time points for as long as 3 years after APBI. Results: 104 women had planning computed tomography scans showing visible seromas, met dosimetric constraints, and were treated with APBI to doses of 35 Gy (n = 9), 36 Gy (n = 33), or 38.5 Gy (n = 62). Eighty-seven patients were evaluated with minimum 3-year follow-up after APBI. Radiation dermatitis, breast edema, breast induration, and fatigue decreased from baseline levels or stabilized by the 3-year follow-up. Hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, breast pain, and telangiectasia slightly increased from baseline levels. Most toxicities at 3 years were Grade 1. Only 1 patient had a Grade 3 toxicity with telangiectasia in a skin fold inside the 95% isodose. Cosmesis was good to excellent in 86% (89/104) of women at baseline and 82% (70/85) at 3 years. The 3-year disease-free survival was 97%, with only one local recurrence that occurred in a different quadrant away from the treated site and two distant recurrences. Conclusions: At 3 years, toxicity and cosmesis were acceptable, and local control and disease-free survival were excellent, supporting continued accrual to randomized APBI trials.  Inc."
"Berrang, T. S., et al.",2009,3D Ultrasound Can Contribute to Planning CT to Define the Target for Partial Breast Radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The role of three-dimensional breast ultrasound (3D US) in planning partial breast radiotherapy (PBRT) is unknown. This study evaluated the accuracy of coregistration of 3D US to planning computerized tomography (CT) images, the seroma contouring consistency of radiation oncologists using the two imaging modalities and the clinical situations in which US was associated with improved contouring consistency compared to CT. Materials and Methods: Twenty consecutive women with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled prospectively after breast-conserving surgery. Subjects underwent 3D US at CT simulation for adjuvant RT. Three radiation oncologists independently contoured the seroma on separate CT and 3D US image sets. Seroma clarity, seroma volumes, and interobserver contouring consistency were compared between the imaging modalities. Associations between clinical characteristics and seroma clarity were examined using Pearson correlation statistics. Results: 3D US and CT coregistration was accurate to within 2 mm or less in 19/20 (95%) cases. CT seroma clarity was reduced with dense breast parenchyma (p = 0.035), small seroma volume (p < 0.001), and small volume of excised breast tissue (p = 0.01). US seroma clarity was not affected by these factors (p = NS). US was associated with improved interobserver consistency compared with CT in 8/20 (40%) cases. Of these 8 cases, 7 had low CT seroma clarity scores and 4 had heterogeneously to extremely dense breast parenchyma. Conclusion: 3D US can be a useful adjunct to CT in planning PBRT. Radiation oncologists were able to use US images to contour the seroma target, with improved interobserver consistency compared with CT in cases with dense breast parenchyma and poor CT seroma clarity.

"Bhandare, N., et al.",2013,A comparison of the early toxicities of balloon catheter high-dose-rate brachytherapy (BCHDRB) and intraoperative radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate and compare the early toxicities after intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) to those of BCHDRB brachytherapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Materials/Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected dataset of early-stage breast cancer patients treated between 2007 and 2012 was performed to evaluate the early toxicities related to IORT as compared to BCHDRB. Seventy-eight patients were treated with IORT and 15 patients were treated with BCHDRB. The prescribed dose for IORT patients was 20 Gy to the surface of the applicator with the radius of the applicator varying from 3.5 to 5.0 cm. The dose at 1 cm from the applicator varied from 5 to 7 Gy. BCHDRB patients received a total dose of 34 Gy delivered with twice-daily fractionation over 5 days. The cavity size varied between 30 to 50 cc. The dose was prescribed to 1.0 cm from the surface of the cavity. The median followup time for the IORT group was 12.5 months and that for the BCHDRB group was 36 months. Toxicities were evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicity scoring system based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Advanced Events version 3.0; posttreatment cosmesis was assessed using the Harvard breast cosmesis score. Results: Early postoperative seromas (grades I and II) developed in 26 (32.5%) patients in the IORT group with a majority of the seromas being asymptomatic and resolving in 4 to 6 months. Four (5%) of the patients required a single aspiration for symptomatic seroma. Of the BCHDRB group 5 (33%) patients developed seromas (grades I and II). Symptomatic seroma was observed in 2 (13.3%) patients and 1 patient required a single aspiration. Other observed toxicities in the IORT and BCHDRB groups, respectively, were as follows: dermatitis, 4 patients (5.1%) and 2 patients (13.3%); fibrosis, 1 patient (1%) and 3 patients (20.0%); and breast infection, 4 patients (5.0%) and 2 patients (13.3%). In the IORT group, breast cellulitis was managed by antibiotics in 3 (4%) patients. In the BCHDRB group, fat necrosis occurred in 2 (13.3%) patients. In the IORT group, at the12-month follow-up, 92% of patients had excellent or good cosmesis and 8% of patients had fair or poor cosmesis. In the BCHDRB group, at 26 months of follow-up 83% of patients had excellent or good cosmesis and 17% had fair or poor cosmesis. Conclusions: IORT has been shown to be an equivalent treatment in earlystage breast cancer as whole-breast irradiation. The benefits of IORT include a shorter treatment time, less dermatitis, fewer infections, and improved cosmesis over BCHDRB."
"Bisht, S. S., et al.",2011,Incidental dose to axilla in early breast cancers with different radiation techniques.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The debate over the role of incidental radiation in dealing with axillary micro metastasis has intensified after the results of Z0011 trial. Literature is also sparse on the incidental dose received by intact or minimally dissected axilla in early breast cancer. This dosimetric study attempts to quantify the incidental dose delivered to intact or minimally dissected axilla with three different tangential techniques ,intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D-conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) and conventional half beam block (HBB) in early breast cancers treated by breast conservative surgery (BCS) followed by radiation (RT) to breast alone. Materials/Methods: Ten cases of early breast cancer that underwent BCS with negative sentinel node biopsy and no further axillary dissection followed by RT to breast alone were chosen. A dosimetric study was planned on the CT image sets used for RT planning. Axillary nodal levels (I, II, II) were contoured. Dose prescribed to PTV was 50Gy in 25 fractions. For 3DCRT and IMRT plan, 95% of PTV was planned to receive at least 95% of the prescribed dose. Three plans were devised for each CT data sets which includes HBB, 3DCRT and tangential IMRT plan. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were used for evaluation and comparisons of all three axillary levels for three different techniques. Axillary level I, II, III were evaluated for mean dose, volume receiving 95% of prescribed dose (V95%), V90%, V80% and V50%. Comparison were made using chi square, linear by linear association test. Results: The average volume of level I, II and III was 54cc, 20.4cc and 8.3cc respectively. The average dose delivered to axilla by IMRT, 3DCRT and HBB was as: Level l- 80.7%, 81.6%, 85.8%; level II-69%. 70%, 67%; level III-52.3%, 51.6%, 41.8%. V90% for level I by IMRT, 3DCRT and HBB was 50%, 64.3% and 69% respectively (IMRT vs. 3DCRT 0.01, IMRT vs. HBB 0.01, 3DCRT vs. HBB 0.11). For level II, V90% was 33.8%, 40%, 26.2% (IMRT vs. 3DCRT 0.02, IMRT vs. HBB 0.05, 3DCRT vs. HBB 0.07); for level III, V90% was 13%, 15% and 9.1% by IMRT, 3DCRT and HBB. Conclusions: Level I received least dose by IMRT technique, whereas level II and III, received least dose by HBB. Axilla receives substantial amount of incidental radiation by all the 3 techniques. This dose might contribute to axillary toxicity but at the same time can have beneficial role in dealing with micro metastasis/ isolated tumor cells. Further clinical and radiobiological studies should be done to explore the impact of incidental dose of radiation to axilla."
"Bloom, E., et al.",2014,Mean cardiac dose less with adjuvant breast brachytherapy than with whole breast irradiation with deep inspiratory breath hold technique.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the mean cardiac dose delivered with adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with a single-entry hybrid brachytherapy device to the mean cardiac dose delivered with adjuvant whole breast radiation with deep inspiratory breath hold technique (DIBH), in patients with early stage left-sided breast cancer who have undergone breast-conserving surgery. Materials/Methods: Fifty patients treated with adjuvant APBI with a singleentry brachytherapy device for an early stage left-sided breast cancer at one of the five regional centers of our institutionwere randomly selected frompatients who enrolled on an institutional protocol prospectively evaluating the acute and late normal tissue sequela of APBI from the dates of January 1, 2010 through October 1, 2013. Fifty additional patients with early stage left-sided breast cancerwhowere treatedwithwhole breast irradiationwith aDIBHtechnique at one of the five regional centers during the same time periodwere also randomly selected. Clinical records and treatment plans were retrospectively reviewed. Mean cardiac dose, age of patient, stage of disease, and facility locations were extracted for analysis. Statistical significance was evaluated by probability associated with the paired t-test. Results: The average mean cardiac dose for patients treated with breast brachytherapy was 18.76 cGy, median heart dose 17.63 cGy. The average mean cardiac dose for patients treated with whole breast irradiation utilizing DIBH was 62.87 cGy,median dose 63.65 cGy. The lower mean heart dosewith breast brachytherapy was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusions: AdjuvantAPBIwith a single-entry brachytherapy device results in an almost 0.5 Gy reduction in mean cardiac dose as compared to adjuvant whole breast radiation with a DIBH. As, Darby et al has demonstrated, the rate of major coronary events after whole breast irradiation increases linearly with mean heart dose by 7.4% per gray, with no apparent threshold APBI with a brachytherapy device would be expected to lower the risk of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity over that of whole breast radiation utilizing one of the most sophisticated methods of cardiac exclusion, DIBH."
"Boero, I. J., et al.",2017,The Impact of Radiation Oncologists on the Early Adoption of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Despite multiple randomized trials showing the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy in early-stage breast cancer, the United States has been slow to adopt this treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of individual radiation oncologists on the early adoption of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Methods We identified 22,233 Medicare beneficiaries with localized breast cancer that was diagnosed from 2004 to 2011 who underwent breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiation. Multilevel, multivariable logistic models clustered by radiation oncologist and geographic practice area were used to determine the impact of the provider and geographic region on the likelihood of receiving hypofractionated compared with standard fractionated radiation therapy while controlling for a patient's clinical and demographic covariates. Odds ratios (OR) describe the impact of demographic or clinical covariates, and the median OR (MOR) describes the relative impact of the individual radiation oncologist and geographic region on the likelihood of undergoing hypofractionated radiation therapy. Results Among the entire cohort, 2333 women (10.4%) were treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy, with unadjusted rates ranging from 0.0% in the bottom quintile of radiation oncologists to 30.4% in the top quintile. Multivariable analysis found that the individual radiation oncologist (MOR 3.08) had a greater impact on the use of hypofractionation than did geographic region (MOR 2.10) or clinical and demographic variables. The impact of the provider increased from the year 2004 to 2005 (MOR 2.82) to the year 2010 to 2011 (MOR 3.16) despite the publication of long-term randomized trial results in early 2010. Male physician and radiation oncologists treating the highest volume of breast cancer patients were less likely to perform hypofractionation (P<.05). Conclusions The individual radiation oncologist strongly influenced the likelihood of a patient's receiving hypofractionated radiation therapy, and this trend increased despite the publication of long-term data showing equivalence to standard fractionation. Future research should focus on physician-related factors that influence this decision."
"Bondiau, P. Y., et al.",2019,"Robotic Stereotactic Boost in Early Breast Cancer, a Phase 2 Trial.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of a single-fraction 8-Gy stereotactic boost after whole-breast irradiation in early breast cancer. The primary aim of this phase 2 study was to evaluate cutaneous breast toxicity using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) 3 months after the boost. Secondary objectives were local control, survival, and patient-reported quality of life using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and breast-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-BR 23 questionnaires. Methods and Materials: Patients with invasive ductal or lobular pT1-2 breast cancer treated with lumpectomy with clear margins and pN0 were included. Patients requiring chemotherapy were excluded. Results: Twenty-eight eligible patients received the planned boost, and 26 had hormonal therapy. The procedure was technically successful without procedural complications. A median of 3 fiducials were tracked, and 115 beams were used. There were 22 acute grade 1 breast skin toxicities, including fibrosis, pain, erythema, or pigmentation. There were 2 acute grade 2 erythemas. Median skin boost dose was inversely correlated with acute skin toxicity (P =.028). QLQ-C30 scores revealed acute dyspnea and arm symptoms without correlation to the boost dose. Breast symptom QLQ-BR23 scores did not deteriorate, although upset with hair loss and systemic side effects of hormonal therapy were observed. After a median follow-up of 38 months, 1 patient had in-boost-field relapse, and there were 5 late grade 1 and 1 grade 2 skin toxicities. Conclusions: Single-fraction stereotactic boost after conventional whole-breast irradiation in early breast cancer is feasible with minor toxicities. Quality of life and specific breast items showed excellent patient acceptance."
"Borger, J. H., et al.",2007,Cardiotoxic Effects of Tangential Breast Irradiation in Early Breast Cancer Patients: The Role of Irradiated Heart Volume.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) after postlumpectomy irradiation restricted to tangential fields. Methods and Materials: We assessed the incidence of CVD in 1601 patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer (BC) treated with breast tangentials in five different hospitals between 1980 and 1993. Patients treated with radiation fields other than breast tangentials and those treated with adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. For patients with left-sided BC, maximum heart distance (MHD) was measured on the simulator films as a proxy for irradiated heart volume. Risk of CVD by laterality and MHD categories was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: Follow-up was complete for 94% of the patients, and median follow-up was 16 years. The incidence of CVD overall was 14.1%, of ischemic heart disease 7.3%, and for other types of heart disease 9.2%, with a median time to event of 10 to 11 years. The incidence of CVD was 11.6% in patients with right-sided BC, compared with 16.0% in left-sided cases. The hazard ratio associated with left-sided vs. right-sided BC was 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.81) for CVD overall, 1.35 (95% CI, 0.93-1.98) for ischemic heart disease, and 1.53 (95% CI, 1.09-2.15) for other heart disease, adjusted for age, diabetes, and history of CVD. The risk of CVD did not significantly increase with increasing MHD. Conclusions: Patients irradiated for left-sided BC with tangential fields have a higher incidence of CVD compared with those with right-sided cancer. However, the risk does not seem to increase with larger irradiated heart volumes.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Boyages, J., et al.",1992,Breast conservation: Long-term Australian data.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Long-term data on the management of early breast cancer in Australia by conservative surgery and radiation therapy is limited. To examine this issue we reviewed our experience of 131 patients with Stage I or II breast cancer treated between November 1979 and December 1985. Ninety patients had a T1 tumor and 41 a T2 tumor. The extent of surgery varied from a local excision (LE), a wide local excision, to a quadrantectomy or partial mastectomy. Sixty-two per cent of patients also had an axillary dissection. One hundred and nineteen patients were treated using 6Mev photons to the whole breast (Median dose; 50 Gy) ± regional nodes followed by a single plane Iridium-192 boost to the primary tumor site (median dose; 30 Gy). Ten patients did not receive a boost and two elderly patients were treated with an implant only. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 83 months (range, 51-133 months). Six other patients were lost to follow-up at a median of 48 months (range, 4-62). The pattern of first relapse is: breast alone, 7.0%; breast + distant, 0.75%; breast + nodes, 0.75%; regional nodes only, 0.75%; and distant disease, 18%. The extent of surgery did not influence the probability of a recurrence in the primary tumor region. The time to a breast recurrence ranged from 12 to 127 months (median, 61 months). The 5-year actuarial rate of a breast recurrence was 4.5%. The 5-year freedom from distant relapse was 80%. The complications of treatment were acceptable. These included rib fracture (5%), symptomatic pneumonitis (4%), fat necrosis or fibrosis requiring surgery (4.5%), severe arm edema (4.5%). The treatment of the axilla by both surgery plus radiation therapy was associated with a moderate or severe arm edema rate of 29% compared to 8% for surgery alone and 6% for radiation therapy alone. Our long-term data indicate that conservative surgery plus radiation therapy is associated with low rates of breast cancer recurrence which are independent of the extent of surgical resection. Complications were acceptably low provided that the axilla was treated by surgery or radiation therapy but not by both modalities."
"Brastianos, H., et al.",2019,Use of Electromagnetic Reconstruction of Catheter Paths in Breast Brachytherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): For women diagnosed with an early stage breast cancer, breast conservation therapy followed by accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an appropriate treatment option for women. There have been many techniques used for APBI, including multi-catheter interstitial breast brachytherapy (MCIBB). Reconstruction of catheter paths can be laborious and may introduce human error. To validate the position of the catheters post implantation, we propose using electromagnetic (EM) reconstruction to help with catheter identification and reconstruction. We evaluated the technology in two imaging suites where brachytherapy procedures are performed. Materials/Methods: Twelve anthropomorphic plastic phantoms were made, each containing a simulated tumor bed visible on CT and ultrasound. Each phantom had 7-10 catheters implanted under ultrasound guidance. We tested our open-source EM reconstruction method in two breast brachytherapy rooms to best simulate working conditions. Each room had a CT scanner from a different manufacturer. To perform the EM reconstruction procedure, we guided a small electromagnetic sensor through each of the individual catheters and recording its positions. Using 3D slicer, an open source platform, we reconstructed the paths of the catheters. We acquired CT scans of the phantoms and superimposed the CT generated paths over the reconstructed paths. The accuracy of the reconstructed paths was determined by measuring the distance between the EM reconstructed path to the catheter paths generated from the CT scans. Results: Fifty-three catheters were implanted in 7 phantoms in room 1. We found that the mean error in room 1 was 2.0 mm ±1.2 mm (median 1.8 mm, interquartile range 1.1 [1.3-2.4] mm), which was higher than the voxel size of the CT scans (voxel size=1.2mm). We implanted 48 catheters in five phantoms in room 2. For room 2, the average deviation between the planned and reconstructed catheters paths was 0.6 mm ±0.2 mm (median 0.5 mm, interquartile range 0.3 [0.4-0.7] mm). This was significantly lower than the voxel size for CT scans (p=0.001). Conclusion: Our results show that EM reconstruction can be as accurate as a CT for identifying catheter paths for MCIBB implants. This technology is valuable because it does not introduce additional radiographic exposure for patients and can be easily incorporated into clinical planning workflow. However, we found that the surrounding environment may affect the accuracy of the reconstruction. The differences in the mean errors between each room was most likely caused by the presence of different imaging equipment and magnetic field distortions. However, this difference typically nears the resolution of CT-based planning. Further research is required to improve the robustness of EM reconstruction in preparation for evaluation on patients."
"Brastianos, H., et al.",2017,Reconstruction of catheter paths for high dose rate breast brachytherapy: A phantom model.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is performed in early-stage breast cancer patients after lumpectomy, and treats the surgical bed rather than the entire breast. The treatment time for APBI is one week or less compared to conventional whole-breast irradiation where the treatment time ranges from three to seven weeks. One treatment modality in APBI is multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy (MIB); however, MIB is a technically challenging procedure because knowledge of both the positioning and the spacing of the inserted catheters is crucial for achieving adequate dosimetric coverage of the lumpectomy cavity. Conventionally, ultrasound, fluoroscopy, or computed tomography (CT) are used to determine the catheter positioning and spacing, but these are either difficult to interpret, or they expose the patient to radiation. We investigated the use of electromagnetic reconstruction (EMR) for this purpose. This study compares the catheter paths recorded with EMR with catheter paths modeled on CT. Purpose/Objective(s): Two anthropomorphic plastic phantoms were made with simulated tumour beds that could be seen with both ultrasound and CT. In this experiment, thirteen catheters were inserted into the phantoms using ultrasound guidance. EMR was performed by pulling through each catheter an electromagnetic enabled sensor and collecting position information. The position information was then used to reconstruct the catheter path based on a least-squares polynomial fit using the free and open-source 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org) platform. The sensor transmitted position information to a navigation computer using the PLUS toolkit software. CT images were collected and aligned with the reconstructions to conduct an analysis of accuracy. The Vascular Modeling Toolkit software was used to compare the EM-generated paths to the CT generated paths. The paths were then aligned and measured at regular positions along the phantom. The aim of the study was to be accurate within 0.68mm, which is the axial resolution of the CT scanner. Results: The thirteen catheters modeled with EMR were all aligned with the paths imaged on the CT scan. The mean distance between the catheter paths modeled on the CT scan and EMR was 0.38 +/-0.13 mm, which is lower than the axial resolution of the CT scanner. The use of EMR was accurate and reproducible for determining the paths of the implanted catheters. Conclusion: The results of this phantom experiment suggest that using EMR is a promising tool that is consistent and reproducible. EMR's ability to accurately determine catheter positioning and spacing in three dimensions may be useful in facilitating planning. Further research is being conducted to use this tool in patients and in clinical trials."
"Brastianos, H., et al.",2016,Electromagnetic tracking for catheter insertion guidance for high-dose-rate breast brachytherapy: A phantom experiment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): The recommended treatment for early-stage breast cancer is breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation. Whole-breast irradiation is the current standard of care. An alternative is accelerated partial breast irradiation using multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, which may be used to deliver radiation therapy in 1 week or less. To achieve ideal dosimetry over the tumor bed, the catheters must be placed parallel with equal spacing in the highly deformable breast tissue, currently a technical challenge. Our proposal uses real-time electromagnetic (EMT) navigation to accurately insert catheters. Materials/Methods: A tissue-locking needle and ultrasound (US) probe is equipped with EMT capability. The needle is inserted and locked in the tumor bed under US guidance, which provides a locally rigid reference. The desired volume is contoured in US, resulting in a tracked model of the tumor bed in a virtual view. An EMT-enabled needle guide is pointed at the target and a catheter needle is inserted through the guide into the tissue. Additional parallel catheters are planned on the virtual view based on the first insertion and implanted in the target. The guidance software is built on the 3D Slicer (www.slicer.org) open source platform. Anthropomorphic plastic phantoms were made, each having a simulated tumor bed that can be visualized in both US and CT. Our demonstration contained 2 rows of 5 catheter needles per row, for a total of 10 catheters, which were inserted in the 2 phantoms. The purpose was to position each catheter 1.0 cm apart. The first phantom had catheter needles inserted under sole US guidance to the target and the second under combined EMT-US guidance. Both insertions were performed by the same operator. The position of the catheters relative to the tumor bed was measured in CT. Results: Under sole US guidance, 7 out of 10 catheters passed through the tumor bed. The catheter spacing was inconsistent and the desired goal of 2 rows of 5 equally spaced catheters was not precisely achieved, with a mean spacing of 1.0 cm with 0.7-1.9 cm range. Using combined EMT-US guidance, 9 out of 10 catheters passed through the tumor bed, resulting in 2 rows of 5 catheters with more consistent spacing and a mean spacing of 1.0 cm with 0.8-1.2 cm range. Conclusion: This phantom experiment suggests that combined EMT-US guidance can be a potential tool to help achieve consistent catheter spacing over a tumor bed. These results are preliminary, and a trial of the method is now being conducted to validate our results. Additional research is also being performed to translate the proposed navigation technique to patient trials."
"Braunstein, L. Z., et al.",2017,Prospective study of adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation using 40 gy daily fractionation following lumpectomy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The majority of studies examining accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) have used twice per day fractionation. Cosmesis with this approach has produced mixed results and the optimal fractionation scheme remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of APBI with a total dose of 40Gy in 10 daily fractions. Purpose/Objective(s): Between 2010 and 2014, we prospectively enrolled 100 patients to receive APBI following lumpectomy for invasive or in situ node-negative breast cancer. Radiation was administered via 3D-conformal techniques. Results: The median age was 62 (range 39-85) and all evaluable patients underwent APBI per protocol. With a median follow-up of 3 years, we evaluated patient-reported local toxicity and recurrence outcomes. Grade 1 or 2 pain developed at the site of radiation in 11% (95% CI 6.9%-20.0%) and 11% similarly developed grade 1 or 2 fibrosis or retraction (95% CI 6.9%-20.0%). Two patients developed rib tenderness with 1 subsequently sustaining a rib fracture. Fat necrosis arose clinically in 2% (95% CI 0.6%-7.0%) of patients with radiographic evidence of necrosis in 3% (95% CI 1.0%-8.5%). At last followup, 97% exhibited excellent or good patient-reported cosmesis (95% CI 91.1%-99.4%), 3% had fair cosmesis (95% CI 0.6%-8.8%), with no reported poor cosmetic outcomes. Overall, grade 1 toxicity arose in 26% (95% CI 18.4%-35.4%), mostly consisting of skin fibrosis and retraction. Grade 2 toxicity was noted in 3% (two patients with fibrosis, one with cellulitis), with no higher grade events. Overall, 3 recurrences were noted: 1 local recurrence in the same quadrant as the initial tumor (3 years after APBI), 1 in a different quadrant of the same breast (5 years after APBI), and 1 with distant disease that arose 2 years after APBI. Conclusion: Among an appropriately selected group of early stage breast cancer patients, APBI to a dose of 40Gy in 10 daily fractions was well tolerated, with the majority of patients (97%) reporting excellent or good cosmesis. These findings contrast with those of the RAPID trial which administered 38.5Gy in twice-daily fractions, with 26% of patients reporting adverse cosmesis (Olivotto et al. JCO, 2013). Longer follow-up will be needed to establish efficacy and subsequent LR rates. A comparison of outcomes with once daily and twice daily PBI is underway at our institution."
"Braunstein, L. Z., et al.",2019,Daily Fractionation of External Beam Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation to 40 Gy Is Well Tolerated and Locally Effective.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Most studies examining accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) have used twice-daily fractionation. Cosmesis with this approach has produced mixed results, and the optimal fractionation scheme remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of APBI with a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Methods and Materials: Between 2010 and 2014, we prospectively enrolled 106 patients to receive APBI after lumpectomy for invasive or in situ node-negative breast cancer. Radiation was administered via 3-dimensional conformal techniques. Results: The median age was 62 years (range, 39-85), and all patients underwent APBI per protocol. With a median follow-up of 58 months, we evaluated patient-reported local toxicity and recurrence outcomes. Of 106 patients, 16 (15%) experienced grade ≥2 skin toxicity. The most common significant toxicities were acute cutaneous changes at 4 to 9 weeks after radiation therapy, including grade 2 erythema in 2 patients (1.8%) and skin color changes in 4 patients (3.8%). Only 2 instances of grade 3 toxicity were reported, including 1 patient with acute moist desquamation after radiation therapy and another with fibrosis at 2 years. Planning target volume and breast V20 were significantly predictive of skin/subcutaneous toxicity, with evidence that limiting breast V20 to <45% may improve tolerability. Overall, 3 breast cancer recurrences arose: 1 local recurrence in the original quadrant (3 years after APBI), 1 in a different ipsilateral quadrant (5 years after APBI), and 1 with distant disease 2 years after APBI. Conclusions: In an appropriately selected group of patients with early stage breast cancer, APBI to a dose of 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions was well tolerated, with most patients (99%) reporting excellent/good cosmesis. Planning target volume and breast V20 should be carefully constrained to limit local morbidity. Longer follow-up will be needed to establish efficacy and subsequent local recurrence rates."
"Burke, M. F.",1995,Conservative therapy of breast cancer in Queensland.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Primary radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery has been an accepted alternative to mastectomy in Europe and North America for many years. In Australia, however, the history of breast conservation for early invasive breast cancer is much shorter. 'the purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of breast conservation in a state-wide Australian radiotherapy service. Methods and Materials: Between January 1982 and December 1989, 512 patients were treated with primary radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery. This analysis is based on u review of these patients, all of whom had Stage I or II breast cancer. Results: With a median follow-up of 50 months, the 5-year actuarial rate of overall survival was 84% and disease-free survival was 80%. There have been 22 isolated local recurrences in the breast. The time to an isolated breast recurrence ranged from 12 to 83 months (median, 26 months). The S-year actuarial rate of an isolated breast recurrence was 4%. The recurrence rate was higher for patients with involved margins (15% vs. 2%, p < 0.01). local recurrence was also more likely in the presence of extensive ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS), as opposed to no extensive DCIS (10% vs. 2%, p < 0.01). Conclusion: These results affirm that primary radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery in Queensland, has been given with a low rate of local recurrence, comparable to that obtained in other centers."
"Burstein, H. J., et al.",2006,Prospective evaluation of concurrent paclitaxel and radiation therapy after adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for Stage II or III breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of concurrent radiation therapy and paclitaxel-based adjuvant chemotherapy, given either weekly or every 3 weeks, after adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). Methods and Materials: After definitive breast surgery and AC chemotherapy, 40 patients with operable Stage II or III breast cancer received protocol-based treatment with concurrent paclitaxel and radiation therapy. Paclitaxel was evaluated on 2 schedules, with treatment given either weekly × 12 weeks (60 mg/m 2), or every 3 weeks × 4 cycles (135-175 mg/m2). Radiation fields and schedules were determined by the patient's surgery and pathology. The tolerability of concurrent therapy was evaluated in cohorts of 8 patients as a phase I study. Results: Weekly paclitaxel treatment at 60 mg/m2 per week with concurrent radiation led to dose-limiting toxicity in 4 of 16 patients (25%), including 3 who developed pneumonitis (either Grade 2 [1 patient] or Grade 3 [2 patients]) requiring steroids. Efforts to eliminate this toxicity in combination with weekly paclitaxel through treatment scheduling and CT-based radiotherapy simulation were not successful. By contrast, dose-limiting toxicity was not encountered among patients receiving concurrent radiation with paclitaxel given every 3 weeks at 135-175 mg/m 2. However, Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis not requiring steroid therapy was seen in 2 of 24 patients (8%) treated in such a fashion. Excessive radiation dermatitis was not observed with either paclitaxel schedule. Conclusions: Concurrent treatment with weekly paclitaxel and radiation therapy is not feasible after adjuvant AC chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Concurrent treatment using a less frequent paclitaxel dosing schedule may be possible, but caution is warranted in light of the apparent possibility of pulmonary injury.  Inc."
"Bush, D. A., et al.",2014,Partial breast radiation therapy with proton beam: 5-year results with cosmetic outcomes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We updated our previous report of a phase 2 trial using proton beam radiation therapy to deliver partial breast irradiation (PBI) in patients with early stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Eligible subjects had invasive nonlobular carcinoma with a maximal dimension of 3 cm. Patients underwent partial mastectomy with negative margins; axillary lymph nodes were negative on sampling. Subjects received postoperative proton beam radiation therapy to the surgical bed. The dose delivered was 40 Gy in 10 fractions, once daily over 2 weeks. Multiple fields were treated daily, and skin-sparing techniques were used. Following treatment, patients were evaluated with clinical assessments and annual mammograms to monitor toxicity, tumor recurrence, and cosmesis. Results: One hundred subjects were enrolled and treated. All patients completed the assigned treatment and were available for post-treatment analysis. The median followup was 60 months. Patients had a mean age of 63 years; 90% had ductal histology; the average tumor size was 1.3 cm. Actuarial data at 5 years included ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence-free survival of 97% (95% confidence interval: 100%-93%); disease-free survival of 94%; and overall survival of 95%. There were no cases of grade 3 or higher acute skin reactions, and late skin reactions included 7 cases of grade 1 telangiectasia. Patient- and physician-reported cosmesis was good to excellent in 90% of responses, was not changed from baseline measurements, and was well maintained throughout the entire 5-year follow-up period. Conclusions: Proton beam radiation therapy for PBI produced excellent ipsilateral breast recurrence-free survival with minimal toxicity. The treatment proved to be adaptable to all breast sizes and lumpectomy cavity configurations. Cosmetic results appear to be excellent and unchanged from baseline out to 5 years following treatment. Cosmetic results may be improved over those reported with photon-based techniques due to reduced breast tissue exposure with proton beam, skin-sparing techniques, and the dose fractionation schedule used in this trial."
"Bush, D. A., et al.",2010,Partial breast irradiation delivered with proton beam: Results of a phase II trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A phase II trial was initiated to determine the safety and efficacy of proton beam irradiation to deliver partial breast radiotherapy following lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Eligible patients had invasive ductal (non-lobular) carcinoma of the breast. Surgical therapy included lumpectomy with negative margins and negative axillary lymph nodes on sampling. Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the surgical bed with an additional 1-cm margin. Proton beam radiotherapy was used to deliver 40 Gy in 10 fractions over a 2- week course. Results: Fifty subjects were enrolled and treated on this trial, with a median follow-up of 36 months. All subjects completed the prescribed treatment without delays. Acute toxicities were limited to mild radiation dermatitis: 26 grade-1 and 4 grade-2. Late skin toxicities included 3 grade-1 telangiectasias. There were no post-treatment infections or ulcerations, and no cases of fat necrosis, rib fractures, radiation pneumonitis, or cardiac events occurred within the follow-up period. Actuarial 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 96% and 92%, respectively; no ipsilateral breast recurrences supervened. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed near-complete elimination of dose to the contralateral breast, lung, and heart. Conclusions: Partial breast radiotherapy delivered with proton beam appears to provide excellent disease control within the ipsilateral breast, with minimal toxicity. No technical limitations prevented treatment delivery. The incidence of post-treatment complications may be less than that reported when utilizing more invasive techniques."
"Bush, D. A., et al.",2017,Long-term quality of life outcomes of proton beam PBI compared with photon whole breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Long-term quality of life (QoL) is a salient factor in assessing outcomes of breast conservation therapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer. This study compares patient-reported QoL outcomes among women with stage 0-II disease treated with partial mastectomy followed by partial-breast proton irradiation (PBPI) or whole-breast photon (WBI). Purpose/Objective(s): PBPI subjects were recruited from previous participation in an institutional prospective clinical trial. WBI subjects were recruited from a registry maintained at the same institution. QoL tools completed included the Harvard Cosmesis Scale (HCS), Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form, and Body Image Scale (BIS). Results: 180 subjects received surveys with 142 being completed and returned yielding a 79% participation rate. 13 were determined to be ineligible due to bilateral disease, disease recurrence, metastatic disease, or other serious medical co-morbidities. 129 participants completed QoL and were included for evaluation, 72 following PBPI and 57 following WBI. Median time from treatment was 7.4 years (PBPI) and 6.3 years (WBI). The two groups were well matched for age, weight, marital status, race, education, employment, recent health status, stage, tumor size, extent of surgery, and use of adjuvant systemic therapy. Significant differences favoring the proton group were seen for several domains. The HCS showed higher cosmetic mean scores for PBPI 3.4 vs WBI 2.4 (p<0.001). BCTOS results showed improved weighted BCTOS (5.5 vs 7.6, p<0.001), cosmetic BCTOS (11.6 vs 15.0, p<0.001), and BS pain (4.2 vs 5.3, p=0.005) for PBPI vs WBI respectively. BFI demonstrated reduced fatigue (2.2 vs 3.8, p=0.002) with less interference with daily general activities (1.7 vs 2.8, p=0.017) for PBPI vs WBI. MOS survey resulted in statistically significant improved perception of general health with improved emotional and social functioning for PBPI. BIS resulted in improved overall score favoring PBPI (12.1 vs 14.2, p=0.009). Conclusion: Patients' responses suggest that partial-breast proton radiotherapy is associated with higher long term overall QoL across multiple domains when compared to a comparable cohort of patients treated with whole breast radiotherapy."
"Buszek, S. M., et al.",2019,Lumpectomy plus Endocrine Therapy or Irradiation in Women Age 70 Years or Older with Hormone Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer: An Analysis of the National Cancer Database.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Interest exists for de-intensification of adjuvant therapy in the treatment of early stage, biologically favorable breast cancer in elderly women. CALGB C9343 examined women ≥70 years (ER+, stage I) treated by lumpectomy followed by either adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) + radiation therapy (RT), or ET alone with a median follow up of 12.6 years. They found no difference in survival (OS) between the groups. PRIME II evaluated women ≥65 years (ER/PR+, T1-2N0) treated with lumpectomy followed by either adjuvant ET or ET+RT with a median follow up of 5 years. They found no differences in overall survival outcomes. Both studies concluded that consideration could be given for omission of RT in this setting. However, toxicity from ET is not trivial and adherence rates range from 40-90%. We hypothesize that de-escalation with use of RT and omission of ET would have comparable survival outcomes in healthy elderly women with early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Patients ≥70 years of age with a Charlson/Deyo (CD) score 0-1 in the National Cancer Database (2010-2014), with T1N0 hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer, who were treated with lumpectomy and either adjuvant ET alone or adjuvant RT alone, were identified. To reduce the impact of treatment selection bias, propensity scores were used to match patients based on age, CD score, education, income, and geographical location. OS was measured from the time of diagnosis to the time of death and was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using stratified log-rank test. Results: A total of 2,995 patients, with a median age of 78 years (range 70-90), met inclusion criteria. The majority of patients had CD score 0 (81%), white ethnicity (91%), clinical stage IA disease (77%), and were ER/PR+ (100%/91%). Of these, 65% (n=1,957) were treated with adjuvant ET alone and 35% (n=1,038) were treated with adjuvant RT alone, following lumpectomy. On multivariate analysis of the matched cohort, older age (HR 1.10, p<0.001) and a CD score of 1 (HR 1.92, p=0.0002) predicted for worse survival; living in an Urban area compared to a metropolitan area portended for improved survival (HR 0.32, p=0.004). Income level and education level did not predict for survival. The median follow up time for all patients was 45 months and the 5-year OS rate in the matched cohort was 85% in both groups. There was no difference in OS between patients treated with adjuvant ET or RT (p=0.41). Conclusion: Healthy (CD 0-1) older patients with hormone receptor positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer treated with lumpectomy followed by either adjuvant RT or ET have equivalent 5 year survival outcomes. Given the relatively high rates of non-compliance with adjuvant ET, a randomized controlled trial to confirm the favorable outcomes we report with either adjuvant RT or adjuvant ET is warranted."
"Buszek, S. M., et al.",2019,Lumpectomy Plus Hormone or Radiation Therapy Alone for Women Aged 70 Years or Older With Hormone Receptor–Positive Early Stage Breast Cancer in the Modern Era: An Analysis of the National Cancer Database.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Deintensification of adjuvant therapy is being considered for older women with early-stage, biologically favorable breast cancer. Although radiation therapy (RT) can be omitted in some cases, toxicity from hormone therapy (HT) is not trivial, and adherence rates vary. We hypothesized that adjuvant RT alone would produce survival outcomes comparable to those with adjuvant HT alone among elderly patients treated with lumpectomy. Methods and Materials: We searched the National Cancer Database (2010-2014) for healthy women (aged ≥70 years, Charlson/Deyo [CD] score 0-1) with T1N0 hormone-receptor-positive, HER-2-negative breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant HT or RT. Propensity scores were used to match patients for analysis. Results: We identified 2995 patients (median age, 78 years), most (81%) with a CD score of 0, clinical stage IA (77%), of whom 65% received HT alone and 35% received RT only after lumpectomy. On multivariate analysis of the matched cohort, older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.13; P < .001), CD score 1 (HR 1.92; 95% CI 1.37-2.70; P = .0002), and living in a metropolitan (vs urban) area (HR 3.09; 95% CI 1.43-6.67; P = .004) were associated with inferior overall survival (OS), whereas treatment with HT (vs RT) was not (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.85-1.49; P = .406). At a median follow-up of 45 months, no difference was found in OS between HT versus RT cohorts (85% and 86%, respectively; P = .44). Conclusions: For healthy, older women with biologically favorable breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant RT or HT is associated with equivalent 5-year OS rates. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to explore these adjuvant monotherapy options in elderly patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer."
"Cahlon, O., et al.",2015,A phase ii study of once a day partial breast irradiation (PBI) for early-stage or noninvasive breast cancer: Early toxicity outcomes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The optimal dose and fractionation for PBI delivered with external beam techniques is not well defined. The majority of PBI trials to date have used a BID fractionation delivered within one week. However, a recent pattern of care study revealed that some patients may prefer daily PBI treatment over two weeks. We conducted a prospective single arm trial to determine the outcomes of PBI with 3D-conformal radiation using 40 Gy once a day for 10 fractions, delivered over two weeks. Materials/Methods: Eligibility criteria included unicentric, pT1 pN0, and pT1 cN0 in women over 70, and low or intermediate grade DCIS measuring less than 2 cm. Negative margins of at least 2 mm were required. The CTV was the tumor bed visualized on CT, as defined by surgical clips. A 1.5- 2.0 cm margin was added to the CTV to create a PTV. 3D conformal radiation employing a combination of photon and electron beams was used to deliver 40 Gy to the PTVin 10 daily fractions. Daily kVimage guidance was used for setup. Toxicities were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events version 4.0. All patients were assessed for toxicities and cosmesis at least once a year following treatment. Results: From September 2010 to February 2014, 100 patients were treated on an IRB-approved protocol. Median follow-up was 25.7 months (range 11 - 48). Median age was 62 years (range 39 - 85). Median tumor size was 0.9 cm. 16 patients had stage 0 carcinoma and 84 patients had stage 1 carcinoma. Local control at 2 years was 99%: one patient recurred 3 cm from the PTVand one patient died of non-malignant cause. Cosmesis was excellent, good, and fair in 64%, 33%, 3%, respectively. According to the CTCAE, 80% of patients experienced grade 1 dermatitis, 6% experienced grade 2 dermatitis, and there was no grade 3 dermatitis. 38% of patients experienced grade 1 fibrosis and 2% had grade 2 fibrosis. There was no grade 3 fibrosis. 46 patients experienced grade 1 pain, zero patients had grade 2 pain, and 1 patient had grade 3 pain, which resolved without any intervention or treatment after several months (this was the only grade 3 toxicity in the entire cohort). Conclusion: PBI with 40 Gy delivered in 10 daily fractions over two weeks is an effective and well tolerated regimen. The early toxicity profile and cosmetic outcomes compare favorably to historical regimens using twice a day fractionation. A formal comparison to 40Gy delivered with BID-fractionation over one week (from a separate protocol) will be reported with the final results."
"Calle, R., et al.",1986,Local control and survival of breast cancer treated by limited surgery followed by irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Between 1960 and 1978, 324 patients with early breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy with or without axillary dissection followed by radiation therapy. All were followed for a minimum of 5 years. All patients were, retrospectively, classified T1, T2, N0, N1a, in the TNM (U.I.C.C.) Classification. The retrospective analysis of the local-regional patterns of failure revealed that young age (≤32 years) and premenopausal status were associated with an increased rate of local failure, whereas tumor size and location showed no influence. No pathological features were associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, whether pathological subtypes, Scarff Bloom and Richardson grading, intraductal associated component, or vascular involvement. The absolute 5 year disease-free survival rate was 87% in patients who recurred and 93% in those who did not. The absolute 10 year disease-free survival rates were 75 and 82%, respectively. Therefore, these results confirm that loco-regional failure does not significantly influence the disease-free survival."
"Cameron, D., et al.",2017,11 years' follow-up of trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive early breast cancer: final analysis of the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.,The Lancet,"Background Clinical trials have shown that trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2 receptor, significantly improves overall survival and disease-free survival in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, but long-term follow-up data are needed. We report the results of comparing observation with two durations of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up of 11 years, for patients enrolled in the HERA (HERceptin Adjuvant) trial. Methods HERA (BIG 1-01) is an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised trial of 5102 women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, who were enrolled from hospitals in 39 countries between Dec 7, 2001, and June 20, 2005. After completion of all primary therapy (including, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as indicated), patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive trastuzumab for 1 year (once at 8 mg/kg of bodyweight intravenously, then 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) or for 2 years (with the same dose schedule), or to the observation group. Primary endpoint is disease-free survival, and analyses are in the intention-to-treat population. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models, and survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab is based on 366-day landmark analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00045032). Findings Of the 5102 women randomly assigned in the HERA trial, three patients had no evidence of having provided written informed consent to participate. We followed up the intention-to-treat population of 5099 patients (1697 in observation, 1702 in 1-year trastuzumab, and 1700 in 2-years trastuzumab groups). After a median follow-up of 11 years (IQR 10·09–11·53), random assignment to 1 year of trastuzumab significantly reduced the risk of a disease-free survival event (HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·68–0·86) and death (0·74, 0·64–0·86) compared with observation. 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab did not improve disease free-survival outcomes compared with 1 year of this drug (HR 1·02, 95% CI 0·89–1·17). Estimates of 10-year disease-free survival were 63% for observation, 69% for 1 year of trastuzumab, and 69% for 2 years of trastuzumab. 884 (52%) patients assigned to the observation group selectively crossed over to receive trastuzumab. Cardiac toxicity remained low in all groups and occurred mostly during the treatment phase. The incidence of secondary cardiac endpoints was 122 (7·3%) in the 2-years trastuzumab group, 74 (4·4%) in the 1-year trastuzumab group, and 15 (0·9%) in the observation group. Interpretation 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab after chemotherapy for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer significantly improves long-term disease-free survival, compared with observation. 2 years of trastuzumab had no additional benefit.

"Cao, J. Q., et al.",2014,Should women younger than 40 years of age with invasive breast cancer have a mastectomy?: 15-year outcomes in a population-based cohort.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Optimal local management for young women with early-stage breast cancer remains controversial. This study examined 15-year outcomes among women younger than 40 years treated with breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation therapy (BCT) compared with those treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Methods and Materials: Women aged 20 to 39 years with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2003 were identified in a population-based database. Primary outcomes of breast cancerespecific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes of local relapseefree survival (LRFS), locoregional relapseefree survival (LRRFS), and distant relapseefree survival (DRFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between BCT and MRM cohorts using logrank tests. A planned subgroup analysis was performed on patients considered ideal for BCT (ie, T1N0, negative margins and no extensive ductal carcinoma in situ) and in whom local therapy may have the largest impact on survival because of low systemic risk. Results: 965 patients were identified; 616 had BCT and 349 had MRM. The median follow-up time was 14.4 years (range, 8.4-23.3 years). Overall, 15-year rates of BCSS (76.0% vs 74.1%, P=.62), OS (74.2% vs 73.0%, P=.75), LRFS (85.4% vs 86.5%, P=.95), LRRFS (82.2% vs 81.6%, P=.61), and DRFS (74.4% vs 71.6%, P=.40) were similar between the BCT and MRM cohorts. In the ideal for BCT subgroup, there were 219 BCT and 67 MRM patients with a median follow-up time of 15.5 years. The 15-year BCSS (86.1% vs 82.9%, P=.57), OS (82.6% vs 82.9%, P=.89), LRFS (86.2% vs 84.2%, P=.50), LRRFS (83.1% vs 78.3%, P=.24), and DRFS (84.8% vs 79.1%, P=.17) were similar in the BCT and MRM cohorts. Conclusions: This population-based analysis with long-term follow-up confirmed that women younger than 40 years treated with BCT had similar 15-year outcomes compared with MRM. Young age alone is not a contraindication to BCT."
"Caudell, J. J., et al.",2007,"A Dosimetric Comparison of Electronic Compensation, Conventional Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy, and Tomotherapy in Patients With Early-Stage Carcinoma of the Left Breast.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been shown to significantly reduce dose to normal tissue while maintaining coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV) in patients with intact breast cancer. We compared delivery of whole breast irradiation utilizing three techniques: electronic tissue compensation (ECOMP), inverse-planned dynamic multileaf collimation IMRT (DMLC), and tomotherapy (TOMO). Patients and Methods: Ten patients with early stage, left-sided breast cancer were selected for planning. CTV was defined as breast encompassed in a standard tangent field minus the superficial 5 mm from the skin edge. Normal tissue contours included the heart, lungs, and contralateral breast. Plans included delivery of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and were normalized to ensure ≥95% coverage of the CTV. Isodose distributions and dose-volume histograms for CTV and normal tissue were compared between plans. The time it took to plan each patient excluding contouring, as well as number of monitor units (MUs) required to execute each plan were additionally tabulated. Results: The TOMO plans resulted in significantly greater heterogeneity (CTV V115) versus ECOMP (p = 0.0029). The ECOMP plans resulted in significantly lower doses to heart, lung, and contralateral breast when compared with TOMO plans. The ECOMP plans were generated in the shortest time (12 min) and resulted in the lowest number of MUs when compared with DMLC (p = 0.002, p < 0.0001) and TOMO (p = 0.0015, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The ECOMP plans produced superior dose distributions in both the CTV and normal tissue when compared with TOMO or DMLC plans. In addition, ECOMP plans resulted in the lowest number of MUs and labor cost.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Celejewska, A., et al.",2016,"The evaluation of tolerance and efficacy of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with breast cancer, after breast-conserving surgery (BCT).",International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): The aim of the study was to estimate tolerance and efficiency of IORT as a boost in patients with early breast cancer in the light of 10 years of experience. Materials/Methods: From 2003 to 2005, 122 patients with breast cancer in stage T1-2, N0-1, were treated in the Center of Oncology Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute, Gliwice Branch in Poland. The median age was 52 years (27-78). All patients underwent BCT followed by IORT using Low-Energy X Rays and EBRT to the whole breast. The total dose from IORT was 5 Gy to 7.5 Gy and was specified 0.5 cm from the applicator surface. The total dose from EBRT was 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions. Radiation therapy included regional lymph nodes if pathological stage was classified as N+ and occurred in 13.9% of patients. The adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonotherapy received 55.5% and 70.6% of patients, respectively. Early complications after BCT combined with IORT included: hematoma, edema, wound infection, skin fistula and skin necrosis. Late toxicity of treatment was evaluated according to RTOG/EORTC criteria. A Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves. Results: The complications after surgery and IORT included: hematoma 15 pts (12.2%), edema 18 pts (14.7%), wound infection 5 pts (4.1%), skin fistula 6 pts (4.9%), and skin necrosis 7 pts (5.7%). Extended wound healing time occurred in 23 pts (17.7%). Late skin toxicity in Grade I developed 94 (77%) pts and Grade II was observed in 9 (7.3%) pts. Late toxicity from subcutaneous tissue in Grade I, II, and III properly developed 87 (71.3%) pts, 20 (16.2%) pts, and 1 patient (0.8%). The median followup was 10 years. Seven pts (5.7%) had local recurrence, but only three (2.4%) of them were solitary. Fifteen pts (12.2%) had distant metastases. Second malignancies appeared in 17 (13.6%) pts. The 10-year LC and OS specific for breast cancer were 96% and 94%, respectively. Conclusion: Treatment was well tolerated and may provide an alternative to other methods. The data of LC and OS are encouraging."
"Cernusco, N. L. V., et al.",2019,Long-Term Outcomes Using Electron IORT APBI for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: The Verona University Hospital Experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) it is a type of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and consists in the administration of radiation therapy on the tumor bed at the time of surgery. Patients deemed at low risk of locale recurrence (LR) or those deemed suitable for partial breast irradiation, according to the GEC-ESTRO and ASTRO recommendations, could be considered as ideal candidates for IORT. Several published studies of electron intraoperative radiation therapy, when delivered as APBI, have demonstrated low recurrence rates (1.5-2.5%) at 5-year follow-up in ASTRO Suitable or ESTRO Good women. There has been no report on IORT APBI with longer follow-up to determine if these excellent low recurrence results persist. We evaluated our patient cohorts treated with IORT APBI, with follow-up up to 10 years, to answer the question of long-term control. Materials/Methods: From July 2006 to December 2015, 295 patients suitable for breast-conserving therapy (BCT) entered a single-arm phase II study and were treated with IOERT, as radical treatment, immediately after surgical resection using a single dose of 21 Gy to Dmax. Patient inclusion criteria were mostly ASTRO Suitable Group except for G3 grade. All patients received IOERT with a mobile electron linear accelerator. Results: With a median follow-up of 84 months, 6 women (2.03%) experienced a true local recurrence (reappearance of the tumor in the same quadrant). None of the patients had a new ipsilateral carcinoma (reappearance of cancer in another quadrant of the same breast). In addition, 5 women (1.69 %) developed distant metastases, 2 (0.67%) a contralateral breast cancer, and 9 (3%) other cancers. 22 patients (7.46%) died. Patients that recurred underwent mastectomy. 5-year overall survival (OS) was 96% (95% CI 92.9; 97.8). We analyzed characteristics associated with a high risk of local relapse such as: age, grading, hormone profile. In univariable analysis, age > 70 years (HR 2.40, 95% CI 2.40; 17.71 p 0.002), grading G2 (HR 9.93, 95% CI 1.25; 69.16 p 0.0294), and negative hormone testing (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.00; 5.93 p 0.0602) have been associated with a lower 5-year OS. In multivariable analysis no statistically significant value were reported except age >70 (p 0.0004). 5-year disease free survival (DFS) was 94.3% (95%CI 90.6; 96.6). Even in this case we analyzed characteristics associated with a high risk of local relapse such as age, grading, hormone profile. In univariable analysis, age > 70 years (HR 4.18, 95%CI 1.96; 8.91 p 0.002), grading G2 (HR 9.93, 95% CI 1.30; 14.14 p 0.0167), and negative hormone testing (HR 2.06, 95% CI 0.94; 4.54 p 0.0602) have been associated with a lower 5-DFS. Conclusion: Data from our trial suggest that single-dose IOERT in early stage breast cancer can be delivered safely and with excellent results. Our long-term recurrence rates are very low. Five OS and DFS rate are results comparable with literature data on EBRT thus encouraging the use of IOERT in subset of low risk patients with early stage breast cancer."
"Chadha, M., et al.",2010,Does time interval between surgery and radiation therapy (RT) influence outcome in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Time intervals between lumpectomy and RT<8 weeks are known to negatively affect local control in early stage breast cancer. In high risk patients, time intervals between surgery and RT are routinely protracted due to the addition of chemotherapy. The time interval is guided by the duration of chemotherapy + reconstructive surgery. TNBC is recognized as an unfavorable subtype associated with high incidence of early relapse. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of time interval between surgery and RT on outcome among patients with TNBC. Materials/Methods: Due to the early pattern of relapse observed among patients with TNBC we elected to study the effect of treatment time intervals on clinical outcome in this population. From 1999 and 2009, we identified 241 patients with invasive TNBC from our breast cancer database. At presentation, 57% of patients had clinically palpable disease; 50% were stage I and 50% had ≥ stage II disease. Surgery included lumpectomy in 186 patients (77%) and mastectomy in 55 patients (23%), and in 20/55 (36%) patients post-mastectomy RT (PMRT) was administered. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was used in the majority of patients, and 9.5% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results: The median follow-up is 35 month, the 5-year KM overall survival is 87%, and relapse-free survival is 73%. The median time to local recurrence is 20 months and distant failure 22 months. The median time interval between the date of diagnosis and start of RT is 6.5 months and 7.04 months among patients that were free of disease (NED) and those that relapsed, respectively (Wilcoxon test 0.035). Among stage I patients, the median time interval from final surgery to start of RT is 4.1 months in patients that are NED and 5.2 months among patients that relapsed. Further, in evaluating patients deemed at highest risk for relapse we reviewed patients treated with mastectomy, chemotherapy and PMRT (n = 20). In this group, 10 patients (50%) relapsed. The median time interval between mastectomy and PMRT was 4.7months for patients that were NED compared to 5.9 months among relapsed patients. Conclusions: This study suggests that in high risk patients the time intervals between surgery and radiation therapy might be an important factor in improving clinical outcome. Additional results using multivariate analysis will be presented. Patients at high risk for relapse, as noted in our study population may benefit by streamlining combination chemotherapy/RT schedules that would safely facilitate reducing time intervals between surgery and RT, as well as decrease overall treatment time. Future studies evaluating combined modality therapy should also study the optimal timing of radiation therapy in high risk breast cancer."
"Chadha, M., et al.",2013,Early-stage breast cancer treated with 3-week accelerated whole-breast radiation therapy and concomitant boost.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To report early outcomes of accelerated whole-breast radiation therapy with concomitant boost. Methods and Materials: This is a prospective, institutional review board-approved study. Eligibility included stage TisN0, T1N0, and T2N0 breast cancer. Patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were ineligible. The whole breast received 40.5 Gy in 2.7-Gy fractions with a concomitant lumpectomy boost of 4.5 Gy in 0.3-Gy fractions. Total dose to the lumpectomy site was 45 Gy in 15 fractions over 19 days. Results: Between October 2004 and December 2010, 160 patients were treated; stage distribution was as follows: TisN0, n=63; T1N0, n=88; and T2N0, n=9. With a median follow-up of 3.5 years (range, 1.5-7.8 years) the 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.94) and 97% (95% CI 0.93-0.99), respectively. Five-year local relapse-free survival was 99% (95% CI 0.96-0.99). Acute National Cancer Institute/Common Toxicity Criteria grade 1 and 2 skin toxicity was observed in 70% and 5%, respectively. Among the patients with ≥2-year follow-up no toxicity higher than grade 2 on the Late Effects in Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic scale was observed. Review of the radiation therapy dose-volume histogram noted that ≥95% of the prescribed dose encompassed the lumpectomy target volume in >95% of plans. The median dose received by the heart D05 was 215 cGy, and median lung V20 was 7.6%. Conclusions: The prescribed accelerated schedule of whole-breast radiation therapy with concomitant boost can be administered, achieving acceptable dose distribution. With follow-up to date, the results are encouraging and suggest minimal side effects and excellent local control.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Chan, E. K., et al.",2014,Adjuvant hypofractionated versus conventional whole breast radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer: Long-term hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose The risk of cardiac injury with hypofractionated whole-breast/chest wall radiation therapy (HF-WBI) compared with conventional whole-breast/chest wall radiation therapy (CF-WBI) in women with left-sided breast cancer remains a concern. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is an increase in hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes with HF-WBI relative to CF-WBI. Methods and Materials Between 1990 and 1998, 5334 women ≤80 years of age with early-stage breast cancer were treated with postoperative radiation therapy to the breast or chest wall alone. A population-based database recorded baseline patient, tumor, and treatment factors. Hospital administrative records identified baseline cardiac risk factors and other comorbidities. Factors between radiation therapy groups were balanced using a propensity-score model. The first event of a hospital admission for cardiac causes after radiation therapy was determined from hospitalization records. Ten- and 15-year cumulative hospital-related cardiac morbidity after radiation therapy was estimated for left- and right-sided cases using a competing risk approach. Results The median follow-up was 13.2 years. For left-sided cases, 485 women were treated with CF-WBI, and 2221 women were treated with HF-WBI. Mastectomy was more common in the HF-WBI group, whereas boost was more common in the CF-WBI group. The CF-WBI group had a higher prevalence of diabetes. The 15-year cumulative hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes (95% confidence interval) was not different between the 2 radiation therapy regimens after propensity-score adjustment: 21% (19-22) with HF-WBI and 21% (17-25) with CF-WBI (P=.93). For right-sided cases, the 15-year cumulative hospital-related morbidity from cardiac causes was also similar between the radiation therapy groups (P=.76). Conclusions There is no difference in morbidity leading to hospitalization from cardiac causes among women with left-sided early-stage breast cancer treated with HF-WBI or CF-WBI at 15-year follow-up.

"Chang, A. J., et al.",2012,Video surface image guidance for external beam partial breast irradiation.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Objective: Accelerated partial breast irradiation is an emerging treatment option for early stage breast cancer. With accelerated partial breast irradiation, patient setup, and target registration accuracy is vital. The current study compared various methods for isocenter placement accuracy. Methods and Materials: Twenty-three patients treated on an institutional-approved partial breast irradiation protocol were monitored at each treatment fraction. All patients included in this study underwent clip placement at the time of surgery. Patients underwent computed tomographic simulation and surface contours were used to reconstruct a reference surface map. At the treatment machine, patients were initially positioned by laser alignment to tattoos. Orthogonal kilovoltage imaging of the chest wall, followed by video surface mapping of the breast, was performed. This video surface map was matched to the reference surface map to adjust the couch position. Verification orthogonal chest wall imaging and video surface mapping was again performed. The accuracy of setup by laser, orthogonal imaging of the chest wall, and surface alignment was retrospectively compared using the centroid clip position as the reference standard. The impact of setup error by surface alignment and by orthogonal kilovoltage imaging on planning target volume coverage was then calculated. Results: Laser-based positioning resulted in a residual setup error of 3.9 ± 3.7 mm, 4.6 ± 3.9 mm, and 4.3 ± 4.5 mm in the posterior-anterior (P-A), inferior-superior (I-S), and left-right (L-R) directions, respectively, using clips as the reference standard. Setup based on bony anatomy with orthogonal imaging resulted in residual setup error of 3.2 ± 2.9 (P-A), 4.2 ± 3.5 (I-S), and 4.7 ± 5.3 mm (L-R). Setup with video surface mapping resulted in a residual setup error of 1.9 ± 2.2, 1.8 ± 1.9, and 1.8 ± 2.1 mm in the P-A, I-S, and L-R directions, respectively. Vector spatial deviation was 8.8 ± 4.2, 8.3 ± 3.8, and 4.0 ± 2.3 mm with laser, chest wall on board imaging, and video surface mapping based setup, respectively. Setup by video surface mapping resulted in improved dosimetric coverage of the planning target volume when compared with orthogonal imaging of the chest wall (V100 96.0% ± 0.1% vs 89.3% ± 0.2%; V95 99.7% ± 0.01% vs 98.6% ± 0.01%, . P < .05). Conclusions: Video surface mapping of the breast is a more accurate method for isocenter placement in comparison to conventional laser-based alignment or orthogonal kilovoltage imaging of the chest wall.

"Chang, D. W., et al.",2014,Prospective study of local control and late radiation toxicity after intraoperative radiation therapy boost for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To report the local recurrence rate and late toxicity of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) boost to the tumor bed using the Intrabeam System followed by external-beam whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in women with early-stage breast cancer in a prospective single-institution study. Methods and Materials Women with breast cancer ≤3 cm were recruited between February 2003 and May 2005. After breast-conserving surgery, a single dose of 5 Gy IORT boost was delivered using 50-kV x-rays to a depth of 10 mm from the applicator surface. This was followed by WBI to a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Patients were reviewed at regular, predefined intervals. Late toxicities were recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring systems. Results Fifty-five patients completed both IORT boost and external-beam WBI. Median follow-up was 3.3 years (range, 1.4-4.1 years). There was no reported locoregional recurrence or death. One patient developed distant metastases. Grade 2 and 3 subcutaneous fibrosis was detected in 29 (53%) and 8 patients (15%), respectively. Conclusions The use of IORT as a tumor bed boost using kV x-rays in breast-conserving therapy was associated with good local control but a clinically significant rate of grade 2 and 3 subcutaneous fibrosis.

"Chao, K. K., et al.",2007,"Analysis of Treatment Efficacy, Cosmesis, and Toxicity Using the MammoSite Breast Brachytherapy Catheter to Deliver Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation: The William Beaumont Hospital Experience.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To review our institution's experience of treating patients with the MammoSite (Cytyc Corp., Marlborough, MA) breast brachytherapy catheter to deliver accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI), for determining short-term treatment efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity. Methods and Materials: From January 2000 to April 2006, 80 patients treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) received adjuvant radiation using the MammoSite (34 Gy in 3.4-Gy fractions prescribed to 1.0 cm from the balloon surface). Twenty-three patients (29%) had Stage 0 breast cancer, 46 (57%) had Stage I breast cancer, and 11 (14%) had Stage II breast cancer. The median follow-up was 22.1 months. Results: Two ipsilateral breast-tumor recurrences (IBTRs) (2.5%) developed for a 3-year actuarial rate of 2.9% (no regional failures were observed). On molecular-based clonality assay evaluation, both recurrences were clonally related. Younger age at diagnosis was the only variable associated with IBTR (continuous variable, p = 0.044; categorical variable [<55 years vs. ≥55 years], p = 0.012). The percentages of patients with good/excellent cosmetic results at 12 and 36 months were 96.9% and 88.2%, respectively (p = NS). Patients with applicator-to-skin spacing <7 mm and those who received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy exhibited lower rates of good/excellent cosmetic results, though the association was not statistically significant. The overall incidence of symptomatic seromas and any seromas was 10% and 45%, respectively. The overall incidence of fat necrosis and infections was 8.8% and 11.3%, respectively. Conclusions: Early-stage breast-cancer patients treated with adjuvant APBI using the MammoSite catheter exhibited a 3-year treatment efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity similar to those observed with other forms of interstitial APBI at this length of follow-up.

"Chapman, B. V., et al.",2019,Quantitative 3D Assessment of Breast Cosmesis After Conventional (CF-WBI) versus Hypofractionated Whole Breast Radiation (HF-WBI): Results of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: HF-WBI is underutilized in the U.S. partly due to concerns of poor cosmetic outcome with the addition of a tumor bed boost. Objectives: We conducted a randomized trial comparing CF-WBI to HF-WBI, both followed by a tumor bed boost. The primary goal of the study was to compare cosmetic outcome by treatment arm using quantitative metrics of symmetry derived from 3D surface images at 3 years post-treatment. A secondary goal was to determine whether the presence of the TGFB1 C509T variant allele, linked to increased radiation fibrosis, is associated with quantitative metrics of symmetry. Methods: From 2011–2014, 287 women age 40 with DCIS or early invasive breast cancer were enrolled in a multicenter trial and randomized to HF-WBI (42.56 Gy/16 fx + 10–12.5 Gy/4-5 fx boost) or CF-WBI (50 Gy/25 fx + 10–14 Gy/5-7 fx). At 3 years post-treatment, 3D images were collected for patients treated at our main campus facility. Patient-reported cosmetic outcome was measured using the Breast Cancer Outcome Treatment Scale (BCTOS). Physician-reported cosmetic outcome was assessed using the RTOG scale. In addition to volume ratios, six quantitative measures of breast symmetry, F1-6C, were calculated using the breast contour and fiducial points assessed on 3D surface images in the supine position. Patient serum samples were subjected to DNA extraction and genotyping for the presence of the TGFB1 C509T variant allele. Associations between all metrics, patient- and physician-reported cosmesis, treatment arm, and genotype were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Among 77 (39 CF-WBI and 38 HF-WBI) evaluable patients, both patient- and physician-reported cosmetic outcomes were significantly associated with the F1C vertical symmetry measure (p<0.05 for both). Increased volumetric symmetry was significantly correlated with improved physician-reported (p=0.03), but not patient-reported cosmesis (p=0.11). At 3 years post-treatment, there were no differences between CF-WBI and HF-WBI with respect to vertical symmetry or volume measures. However, treatment with CF-WBI resulted in increased F6C horizontal symmetry (p=0.05). Patients with the TGFB1 C509T variant allele had lower rates of the vertical symmetry measure F2C (p=0.02). Conclusions: Using 3D image-derived quantitative measures, we now confirm our previous finding that increased vertical symmetry is associated with improved patient and physician-reported cosmesis following WBI. Importantly, both vertical and volumetric symmetry measures were similar between CF-WBI and HF-WBI, further supporting the conclusion that HF-WBI yields comparable subjective and objective cosmetic outcomes at 3 years. Finally, we found that patients with the TGFB1 C509T variant allele had a lower vertical symmetry measure, suggesting a relationship between increased fibrosis susceptibility and decreased symmetry which merits further study. To our knowledge, this is the first study to employ 3D image-based objective assessments of breast symmetry and volume to compare differing fractionation regimens. The above findings suggest that 3D photography may be a more sensitive method for measuring subtle cosmetic changes than global patient- or physician-assessments."
"Chapman, B. V., et al.",2015,Clinical pathways: A catalyst for the adoption of hypofractionation for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) remains underutilized in the United States despite support by multiple clinical trials. We evaluated the success of iterative modifications of our breast cancer clinical pathway on the adoption of HF-WBI in a large, integrated radiation oncology network. Methods and Materials: The breast clinical pathway was modified in January 2011 (Amendment 1) to recommend HF-WBI as the first option for women ≥70 of age with stages 0 to IIA, while maintaining conventional fractionation (CF) as a pathwayconcordant secondary option. In January 2013 (Amendment 2), the pathway's HF-WBI recommendation was extended to women ≥50 years of age. In January 2014 (Amendment 3), the pathway mandated HF-WBI as the only pathwayconcordant option in women ≥50 years of age, and all pathway-discordant plans were subject to peer review and justification. Women ≥50 years of age with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery and adjuvant WBI were included in this analysis. Results: We identified 5112 patients from 2009 to 2014 who met inclusion criteria. From 2009 to 2012, the overall HF-WBI use rate was 8.3%. Following Amendments 2 and 3 (2013 and 2014, respectively), HF-WBI use significantly increased to 21.8% (17.3% in the community, 39.7% at academic sites) and 76.7% (75.5% in the community, 81.4% at academic sites), respectively (P<.001). Compared to 2009 to 2012, the relative risk of using HF-WBI was 7.9 (95% confidence interval: 7.1-8.6, P<.001) and 10.7 (95% CI: 10.3-11.0, P<.001), respectively, after Amendments 2 and 3, respectively. Age ≥70 and treatment at an academic site increased the likelihood of receiving HF-WBI in 2009 to 2012 and following Amendment 2 (P<.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the transformative effect of a clinical pathway on patterns of care for breast radiation therapy. Although our initial HF-WBI use rate was low (8%-22%) and consistent with national rates, the clinical pathway approach dramatically increased adoption rate to >75%. In contrast to passive guidelines, clinical pathways serve as active tools to promote current best practices."
"Chapman, B. V., et al.",2015,Clinical pathways: A catalyst for the adoption of hypofractionation in early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) remains underutilized in the U.S. despite support by multiple clinical trials, ASTRO evidence-based guidelines, and the Choosing Wisely® campaign. Recent publications report HF-WBI rates varying from 15-30%. We evaluated the success of iterative modifications of our breast cancer clinical pathway on the adoption of HF-WBI in a large, integrated radiation oncology network. Materials/Methods: We initially modified our breast clinical pathway in 1/ 2011 (Amendment 1) to recommend HF-WBI as the first option for women aged ≥70 with stages 0-IIA. Conventional fractionation (CF) was still considered a pathway-compliant secondary option. In 1/2013 (Amendment 2), the pathway's HF-WBI recommendation extended to women aged ≥50, in line with ASTRO guidelines. In 1/2014 (Amendment 3), the pathway mandated HF-WBI as the only pathway-compliant option in women aged ≥50. All off-pathway plans (including CF after 1/2014) were subject to peer-review and justification. We included women aged ≥50 treated in our cancer network (4 academic, 16 community sites) with DCIS or invasive breast cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery and adjuvant WBI. Patients treated palliatively, post-mastectomy or with axillary, supraclavicular, or internal mammary fields were excluded. HF-WBI was defined as ≤20 fractions with ≥2.5 Gy/fraction. Multivariable analyses of factors associated with HF-WBI use were performed. Results: We identified 5112 patients from 2009-2014 who met inclusion criteria. From 2009-2012, the overall HF-WBI utilization rate was 8.3%. Following Amendment 2 and 3 (2013, 2014), HF-WBI use significantly increased to 21.8% (17.3% community, 39.7% academic) and 76.7% (75.5% community, 81.4% academic), respectively (p<0.001). Compared to 2009-2012, odds of utilizing HF-WBI increased 20.8 times (95% CI: 15.9-27.8, p<0.001) and 90.9 times (95% CI: 66.7-125.0, p<0.001), after Amendment 2 and 3, respectively. Age ≥70 and treatment at an academic site increased the likelihood of receiving HF-WBI in 2009-2012 and following Amendment 2 (p<0.001). After Amendment 3, only right laterality was associated with increased odds of HF-WBI (p<0.01). The most common justifications for not using HF-WBI in 2014 were unacceptable dose heterogeneity, heart dose, and patient preference. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the transformative effect of a clinical pathway on patterns of care for breast radiation therapy. While our initial HF-WBI utilization rate was low (8-22%) and consistent with national rates, the clinical pathway dramatically increased adoption rate to >75%. This study serves as a proof of concept that clinical pathways with attention to iterative refinement are able to standardize practice patterns and promote change consistent with current evidence-based guidelines."
"Chaudhry, H., et al.",2013,The dosimetric effect of tumor size and position in prone radiation therapy of breast using a novel stereotactic breast irradiation device.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A dedicated stereotactic breast radiation therapy unit was developed to treat small breast tumors. Numerous reports in the literature have identified a strong correlation between radiation toxicity and dose-volume levels for the breast, target volume and proximity to critical structures such as skin and chest wall. Demonstrating the dosimetric capabilities of this novel treatment technique, this study reports the dose-volume characteristics with respect to varying size of breast tumors, tumor locations and proximity to critical structures. Materials/Methods: The device consists of a hemi-spherical, prone irradiation unit housing radioactive Cobalt sources, a 3D maneuverable patient positioning system and a vacuum-assisted breast cup immobilization device with built-in stereotactic fiducial markers. In this study, CT images of a prone breast phantom were acquired while mounted on the dedicated stereotactic immobilization device and subsequently registered in the device treatment planning system. 24 hypothetical target volumes were generated corresponding to lesions of 1, 2 and 3 cm in maximum diameter and positioned in eight different locations within the breast volume (center of the breast, multiple locations at the base of the breast cup as well as apical, lateral and superiorly at 0.5 cm to skin surface). Tumor volumes were expanded 3 mm for localization uncertainty to create final PTV (2.1-24.4 cm3). Dosimetric evaluations include literature based whole breast indices associated with cosmetic outcome, skin (defined as 0.5 cm strip) and plan quality indices such as dose homogeneity and conformity. Results: Maximum dose in all plans were less than 120% of the prescription dose (107-120%) and was realized within the target volume (prescription dose was normalized to cover 95% of the PTV). Median dose homogeneity indices were less than 10% for all plans. Tumor proximity to skin was observed to correlate with larger dose variations across the target volume (p < 0.01). Dose conformity indices ranged from 1.7 to 3.3, 1.0 to 1.3, and 1.1 to 1.4 for 1-, 2- and 3-cm tumors respectively. Median volume of breast receiving 50% of the prescription dose (V50) was 7.8% (2.2- 18.0%) whereas median V20 was 18.6% (6.1-40.0%). Maximum skin dose ranged between 71 to 102% when targets were located within 0.5 cm of the skin surface. In other cases, where the target was away from the skin (> 0.5 cm), skin dose was 9.0 to 71.0%. Conclusions: In efforts to reduce tissue toxicity and promote better cosmesis in patients treated for early stage breast cancer, this study demonstrates the dosimetric ability of the device to deliver highly conformal and homogenous doses in a range of tumor sizes and locations."
"Chauvet, B., et al.",1990,Prognostic significance of breast relapse after conservative treatment in node-negative early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The prognostic significance of local relapse after conservative treatment of early stage breast carcinoma has been controversial. To determine the incidence and the prognostic value of a breast relapse, we analyzed the results obtained in a series of patients with pT1pN0 presentation of breast carcinoma treated conservatively without adjuvant medical treatment. From 1976 to 1986, 202 patients with invasive breast carcinoma of less than 2 cm without lymph node involvement were treated with surgery and radiation therapy. The overall survival rate was 97.2% at 5 years. Locoregional relapses occurred in 16 patients (7.9%). In these patients, the overall survival rate was significantly decreased as compared to that of patients without local relapse (87.5% versus 98.3% at 5 years, p < 0.001). The probability of remaining metastasis-free was also significantly decreased (80.2% vs 91.3%, p < 0.001). Most relapses (94%) appeared at or close to the primary site. Salvage local treatment was possible in 14/16 patients (87.5%). Age, menopausal status, size and site of primary tumor, histological grade, and boost technique did not influence significantly the risk of local relapse occurrence. We concluded that the occurrence of a breast relapse after a successful local conservative treatment is a pejorative prognostic factor predictive of a high risk of distant metastasis development. There is a need to individualize factors that could allow discrimination of patients with a high probability of local relapse and subsequent metastasis."
"Chawla, S., et al.",2013,Geriatric assessment in radiation oncology clinic: A pilot study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): More than 50% of all cancers and 60% of cancer mortality occurs in patients over the age of 65. There are limited studies that have investigated the comprehensive geriatric assessment in radiation oncology clinics. This feasibility Study was offered to cancer patients over the age of 65 who received definitive radiation therapy or combination of radiation and chemotherapy. The goals of the current study were to develop a brief, but comprehensive, primarily self-administered cancer-specific geriatric assessment measure and to determine its feasibility as measured by 1) the percentage of patients able to complete the measure on their own, 2) the length of time to complete and 3) patient satisfaction with the measure. Materials/Methods: A comprehensive assessment approach that included validated sets of tools which screen for problems in one or more Geriatric domains was used. The assessments were administered immediately before or within first week of radiation treatment and again immediately after or within one week of treatment completion in the physician's office. The following domains: Functional Status, Co-morbidity, Cognition, Psychological Status, Social Functioning and Support, and Nutritional Status were assessed. The assessment was administered to any patient with solid cancer including Breast, lung, colorectal and skin who gave informed consent, were fluent in English and received definitive radiation or chemoradiation at University of Rochester (NY, New York)or Rochester General hospital (NY, New York). Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled on the study (mean age 76, years; range, 65-91 years). The majority had early stage breast cancer. The mean time to completion of questionnaires was 16 minutes (7-27 minutes). All eligible patients were able to complete the self-administered portion of the assessment without assistance (100%) and were satisfied with the questionnaire length (100%) at the two time points. There was no association noted between age or educational level and the ability to complete the assessment without assistance. Conclusions: In this study, Comprehensive geriatric assessment could be completed in majority of the patients without assistance in outpatient radiation oncology clinic. Prospective trials of its reliability, validity, and brevity are justified."
"Chen, G., et al.",2011,A dosimetric planning study for hypofractionated whole breast irradiation with concurrent boost (RTOG 1005) for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A new phase III randomized trial (RTOG 1005) of accelerated whole breast irradiation (WBI) for early stage breast cancer is recently approved. The protocol will evaluate hypofractionated WBI plus concurrent boost versus standard WBI plus sequential boost. The purpose of this work is to compare dosimetry plans that would meet protocol dose volume constraints for 3D conformal or intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) for all 7 treatment options allowed in this protocol. Materials/Methods: The CT datasets for representative breast cancer cases previously treated in both supine and prone positions were selected for this study. The targets and organs at risk were delineated per protocol guidelines. Dosimetry plans were generated based on the required dose-volume criteria for the two Arms proposed in RTOG 1005, Arm I: standard WBI with 2 Gy×25 followed by boost with 2 Gy×5, and Arm II: hypofractionated WBI with 2.67 Gy×15 and daily concurrent boost to a total of 3.2 Gy. For each CT set, 7 plans allowed by the protocol were generated: (1) 3DCRTWBI plus electron boost, (2) 3DCRTWBI plus 3DCRT boost, (3) 3DCRT WBI plus IMRT boost, (4) IMRT WBI plus electron boost, (5) IMRT WBI plus 3DCRT boost, (6) IMRT WBI plus IMRT boost, and (7) simultaneous-integrated boost (SIB) with IMRT. SIB plan is allowed for Arm II only. Qualities for these plans were compared. Results: The dose-volume criteria required by the protocol were met in all plans. Examples of the dose-volume parameters for the 7 options are summarized in the table. Dn is the dose covering n% of the volume, Vn% for PTV is the corresponding volume irradiated by n% of the prescribed dose for either WBI or lumpectomy PTV boost for evaluation (PTV-EVAL). The Vn% for normal structures is defined as the volume irradiated by n% of the whole breast prescription dose. The values of lumpectomy PTV-EVAL V120%, and those of heart V40% and V20% for right-sided breast were negligible and not listed in the table. Conclusions: The plan qualities in terms of target coverage and normal tissue sparing for the 7 treatment options allowed in the RTOG 1005 protocol for breast cancer are generally comparable. IMRT for whole breast irradiation and/or boost provides slightly better dose uniformity and/or normal tissue sparing than other options. (Table presented) ."
"Chen, J., et al.",2017,Single institution clinical outcomes for locally recurrent breast cancer patients treated with a second breast conserving surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): For early stage breast cancer patients who have received whole breast radiotherapy as part of their initial treatment, and then present with ipsilateral breast recurrence, a standard treatment option is mastectomy. Recent reports indicate that well-selected patients can be treated with a second breast conserving surgery and partial breast re-irradiation with good toxicity and clinical outcomes. We report the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes for patients treated with a second breast conserving treatment with intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) at our institution. Purpose/Objective(s): Records were retrospectively reviewed of 61 locally recurrent breast cancer patients treated with IORT in the setting of a second breast conserving treatment from 2012-2017. All patients had refused mastectomy and elected for a second breast conserving treatment. Results: The median age at time of IORT was 71 years old (range: 44-85). The median time interval between the initial surgery and the second surgery was 15.8 years (2.3-30.3). The median tumor size was 0.7 cm (0.05-2.7). The histologies of the recurrent tumors were 55.7% invasive ductal carcinoma, 18.0% invasive lobular carcinoma, and 24.6% ductal carcinoma in situ. Regarding receptor status, 55/61 (90.2%) were ER or PR positive, 8/61 (13.1%) were Her2+, and 2/61 (3.3%) were triple-negative. Regarding histologic grade, 4/57 (7.0%) were low-grade, 29/57 (50.9%) were intermediate-grade, and 24/57 (42.1%) were high-grade. There was node positivity in 5/61 (8.2%) patients. At a median follow-up time of 10.3 months (0.0-51.7), there were 2 distant recurrences (2/61 = 3.3%) and 3 local recurrences (3/61 = 4.9%). The two patients with distant recurrence were both diagnosed with bone metastases within a few months of the second breast conserving treatment; both were node-positive. The three local recurrences occurred at 24, 16, and 21 months after the second breast conserving treatment. Two underwent subsequent bilateral mastectomies and the third underwent a third lumpectomy; all three are currently without evidence of disease. Conclusion: For carefully selected patients with locally recurrent breast cancer, IORT as part of a second breast conserving treatment appeared to show acceptable short term clinical outcomes. Nodal status may be a risk factor for a second recurrence. Longer follow-up and proper risk stratification will be necessary to demonstrate efficacy as an alternative treatment option."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2012,Clinical efficacy of 2-versus 5-day accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered via balloon-based brachytherapy: Results of a matched pair analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Limited data is available comparing clinical outcomes using alternative accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) schedules. The purpose of this analysis was to compare efficacy between a 2-day and 5-day schedule in women with early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Patients were treated between June 2000 and January 2011 at a single institution with balloon-based brachytherapy using either a 2-day (2,800 cGy in four 700 cGy BID fractions) or a traditional five-day (3,400 cGy in ten 340 cGy BID fractions) fractionation pattern. The CTV consisted of a 1cm expansion from the balloon surface and a single-lumen device was used in all cases. To compare efficacy between the two treatment approaches, a matched-pair analysis was performed using a one to two ratio which successfully paired 38 two-day patients with 76 five-day patients. Match criteria included minimal length of follow-up ≥1.0 yr, clinical stage, age (+/- 3 yrs), and ER status. Clinical outcomes analyzed include local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastases (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: In comparing clinical-pathological traits of the two groups, no significant differences were noted for age (p = 0.838), clinical stage (p = 1.000), ER status (p=1.000), tumor size (p=0.236), margin status (p= 0.556), nodal stage (p = 0.381), PR (p = 0.749), use of adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.927) or endocrine therapy (p = 0.129). Per the ASTRO Consensus Guidelines, no differences were noted in the distribution of clinical groups between the 2- and 5-day treatment cohorts with the majority of patients categorized as suitable or cautionary (2-day: 92% vs. 5-day: 87% p = 0.436). With a mean follow-up of 4.7 yrs (4.9 yrs for 2-day vs. 4.5 yrs for 5-day, p = 0.279), no differences were seen in the 5- year actuarial rates of LR (0.0% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.359), DFS (94.4% vs. 96.1%, p = 0.618), CSS (100% vs. 94.9%, p = 0.207), or OS (97.3% vs. 92.5%, p = 0.811) between the 2-day and 5-day APBI groups, respectively. There was no RR in either group. Rate of DM was similar for both the 2 and 5-day patients (5.6% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.456). Conclusions: With near 5-year follow-up for the 2-day schedule, APBI treated with the 2-day regimen produced clinical outcomes that were equivalent to the 5-day schema of dose delivery. Reduction in days ontreatment afforded by such hypofractionation offers more flexibility in both clinical and patient scheduling. Further follow-up and increased numbers of treated patients will be needed to substantiate equivalence of adjuvant hypofractionated APBI. An HIC-approved protocol randomizing patients between the 2 versus 5-day treatment schemes is currently open for accrual at our institution."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2017,Comparative analysis of brachytherapy versus 3D conformal external beam radiation therapy in delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation from a single institution: Determination of clinical effectiveness.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We present the results of a comparative analysis of brachytherapy (BT) vs external beam 3-D conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) in the delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in early-stage breast cancer treated at a single institution. Purpose/Objective(s): Between 4/1993 and 8/2016, a total of 784 patients were treated with APBI; 567 received BT using either interstitial multicatheters or a balloon/strut based applicator while 217 received 3-D CRT using CT based planning without IMRT. Eligibility criteria included age > 40, infiltrating ductal carcinoma, with inclusion of invasive lobular and DCIS since 2003 (IRB addendum), margins ≥ 2 mm, and surgically staged axilla with ≤ 3 positive nodes but pN0 since 2003 (IRB modified). The multicatheter BT was either low-dose rate (LDR at 50 Gy in 96 hours) or high-dose rate (HDR at 32 Gy in 8 BID fx of 4 Gy or 34 Gy in 10 BID fx of 3.4 Gy) while the applicator BT was all HDR of 34 Gy in 10 BID fx. The 3-D CRT used 3-5 non-coplanar beams to deliver 3.85 Gy BID x 10 fractions. Results: Median age was 65 (range 39-94). The mean follow-up (FU) was 8.4 years for the 784 patients [9.0 yrs BT, 6.7 for 3-D CRT, p< 0.001]. A higher percentage of DCIS was treated with 3-D CRT vs BT [22% vs 13%, p=0.004]. No statistical difference was noted in mean age, nodal status, margins, tumor size, receptor status and receipt of systemic therapy between the 2 treatment groups (Table 1). Ten year actuarial outcomes reveal no statistical difference between BT and 3-D CRT in freedom from local recurrence [95.4% vs 96.3% p=0.207], freedom from distant metastases [96.1% vs 98.5% p= 0.235], freedom from contralateral breast failure [96.1% vs 95.5% p=0.86], DFS [92.2% vs 96.3% p=0.055], CSS [96.9% vs 99.0%, p= 0.288] and OS [76.4% vs 80.3%, p=0.677]. Conclusion: Delivery of APBI with either BT or 3-D CRT in appropriately selected early-stage breast cancer patients results in comparable clinical outcomes in terms of local control and survival outcomes. Continued follow-up will be needed to assess the long-term effectiveness and equivalence of these two APBI modalities."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2017,"Long-term clinical outcomes, late toxicities, and cosmetic results of short-course two-day brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated radiotherapy is increasingly being adopted for early-stage breast cancer. To assess the long-term outcome of 2-day brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation [2d-APBI], we analyzed patients so treated for clinical effectiveness, late toxicity, and cosmetic results. Purpose/Objective(s): Between 3/2004 and 8/2007, 45 patients were treated with single-lumen applicator-based 2d-APBI [700 cGy BID x 4]. Updated thru 1/2017, an IRB-approved retrospective review was done. Selection criteria included age >40, ≤3.0 cm tumor size, ≤3 pathologically positive lymph nodes, and negative margins (per NSABP guidelines). Based upon the ASTRO Consensus Statement guidelines for APBI (2009) applied retrospectively, 15 were suitable (33%), 27 cautionary (60%), and 3 unsuitable (7%). Freedom from local recurrence (FFLR), regional recurrence (FFRR), distant metastasis (FFDM), contralateral breast cancer (CLBC), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier. Toxicities were scored using CTCAE v3.0. Cosmetic rating was scored via the Harvard criteria. Results: Median follow-up was 9.4 years. Fourteen patients were followed ≥ 10 yrs (31%) and 17 with follow-up of 9.0-9.9 yrs (38%). Median age was 66 yrs (48-83 yrs) with most having T1 tumors (96%) [median size 0.6cm]; all had margins with no tumor on ink. A minority (4%) had positive regional nodes. ER positivity was found in 73%. Endocrine therapy was received by 61%, while 18% had chemotherapy. Clinical outcomes revealed FFLR 97.4%, FFRR 100%, FFDM 92.9%, CLBC 97.4%, DFS 90.3%, CSS 97.6%, and OS 79.0%, all 10-year actuarial. Late toxicities analyzed included skin pigmentation, edema, and pain (all grade 1/2) along with telangiectasias, induration (Table 1), fat necrosis, seroma and rib fracture. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted except for 2% grade 3 telangiectasias and 2% grade 3 induration. Fat necrosis was seen in 14% and persistent seroma in 17%. Rib fracture was seen in 3 (7%) where 160% of the prescription dose was accepted during this treatment era. Cosmesis was good/excellent in 88% at 10 years. Conclusion: With median follow-up approaching 10 years, 2-day APBI demonstrates excellent clinical effectiveness, minimal late morbidity, and good/excellent cosmesis in the majority of patients. Dose constraints such as to ribs/chest wall have been refined from these results. Short-course APBI affords appropriately selected early-stage breast cancer patients irradiation in 2 days vs several weeks of whole breast external beam treatments. Further follow-up of 2-day APBI patients will be needed to substantiate these long-term findings."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2016,"Time-compressed 2-day brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation versus hypofractionated whole-breast external beam radiation for early-stage breast cancer: A comparative analysis of clinical effectiveness, late toxicities, and cosmesis.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Short course, time-compressed radiation therapy is increasingly being adopted for early-stage breast cancer. We performed a propensity-score matched-pair analysis comparing time-compressed 2-day brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation [2d-APBI] and hypofractionated [HFx] whole-breast radiation therapy to assess clinical effectiveness, late toxicities, and cosmetic outcome. Materials/Methods: Between March 2004 and January 2015, appropriately selected patients treated with single-channel balloon-based 2d-APBI [700 cGy BID x 4] or whole-breast 3-week HFx [266 cGy daily x 16] were reviewed as part of an IRB-approved analysis. Follow-up [FU] was 1 year for all patients. Propensity-score matching (1:1 ratio) using age +/-5 years, clinical stage and ER status was performed resulting in 84 patients (42 pairs) for analysis. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastasis (DM), contralateral breast cancer (CLBC), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were compared by Kaplan-Meier. Patient and disease traits were computed using Pearson's chi-square test and paired t-test. Toxicities were scored using CTCAE v4.0. Cosmetic rating was scored via the Harvard criteria. Results: Mean FU for all patients was 5.4 years [7.7 years for 2d-APBI vs 3.1 years for HFx, P < 0.001]. This difference in median follow-up was expected considering era of implementation of each technique (2d-APBI: 2004; HFx: 2009). There was no statistically significant difference in median age, T-stage, grade, nodal status, margins, biomarker status, or menopausal state between the two treatment groups. More HFx compared to 2d-APBI patients received endocrine therapy [80% vs 58% P = 0.036]. Comparing 2d-APBI and HFx, there were no statistically significant differences in IBTR [0% vs 0%], RR [0% vs 0%], DM [2.4% vs 2.4% P = 0.993], CLBC [0% vs 2.4% P = 0.317], DFS [97.6% vs 97.6% P = 0.993], CSS [100% vs 100%], and OS [97.4% vs 88.9% P = 0.72] at five years. Late toxicities analyzed included skin pigment changes, edema, pain, induration, telangiectasias, seroma, and fat necrosis. No grade 3 toxicities were noted except for a 2% versus 0% rate of telangiectasias for 2-d APBI versus HFx, respectively (P = 0.027). Neither seroma nor fat necrosis had significant difference between the two regimens. Cosmetic outcomes were good to excellent in the majority of patients with no statistical difference between the 2 schemes [2d-APBI of 87% good to excellent vs HFx of 96% P = 0.393]. Conclusion: At 5 years, 2d-APBI and Hfx had similar clinical effectiveness, late toxicities, and cosmetic outcomes, with a dramatic reduction in the length of therapy for time-compressed short-course brachytherapy (w48 hours compared with w3-4 weeks). Further FU for patients treated with both techniques are needed to substantiate these findings."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2016,Comparative analysis of strut-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy versus intensity modulated proton therapy for delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for early-stage breast cancer patients has been delivered via varied modalities ranging from brachytherapy (BT) to 3-dimensional conformal external beam. As BT applicators have evolved in customizing dose conformality from interstitial catheters to balloon to strut-based devices, we undertook an investigation of strut-based HDR BT (S-BT) compared to intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) to determine whether IMPT could offer dose distributions comparable to S-BT. Materials/Methods: Ten consecutive patients previously treated with SBT were analyzed. These patients underwent CT scans before and after the S-BT placement. The dose was 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions prescribed to 1 cm from the S-BT applicator. For the S-BT plans, planning target volume (PTV)-Eval was a 1-cm expansion of the cavity minus S-BT applicator, lung, and chest wall as needed. All 10 cases met the planning goals of 90% of PTV-Eval receiving 90% of the prescribed dose (Rx dose), less than 10 mL PTV-Eval receiving 200% of Rx dose; and 50 mL receiving less than 150% of Rx dose. For the virtual IMPT plans, clinical target volume (CTV) was a 1-cm expansion from the cavity. Three-field IMPT was used with robust optimization (3-mm setup and 3.5% range uncertainties). Delivery time for such 3-field IMPT is less than 2 minutes. In order to perform an objective comparison, IMPT plans were normalized to the S-BT target coverage D90 to 90% of PTV-Eval volume. In addition, the cavity was excluded from the proton CTV for DVH parameter calculations. Results: The 3-field IMPT covers a larger target compared to the S-BT (91.6±34.8 mL vs. 74.0±18.6 mL, p=0.18) due to the setup and range uncertainties. There is no significant difference in the absolute volumes of PTV over 115% for plans with protons and those with S-BT, 41.2±31.1 mL vs. 55.9±14.3 mL (PZ0.19). However, the percentage volume of PTV over 115% with proton plans is significantly less than those with S-BT, 45.6%±28.7% vs. 75.5%±3.4%, p<0.01. Lung dose >5 Gy for IMPT plans is 30.3±29.1 mL, which is significantly less than that for S-BT plans with 188.0±65.4 mL, p<0.01. The maximum dose to the skin and ribs for protons vs S-BT is comparable, 35.7±4.3 Gy vs. 31.1±7.6 Gy (p=0.10) and 35.0±6.2 Gy vs. 28.8±8.1 Gy (p= 0.07), respectively. However, the proton plans are inferior compared to the SBT plans in the V50 body integrated dose, 432.6±170.4 mL vs. 267.1±84.2 mL (p= 0.01). Conclusion: This comparative analysis of IMPT to S-BT for the delivery of APBI reveals a dosimetric advantage of IMPT over S-BT in offering more homogeneous target dose coverage along with improved sparing of underlying lung. Maximal dose to the skin and ribs is comparable between protons and S-BT. Moreover, IMPT is a noninvasive form of external beam in contrast to S-BT requiring invasive placement of an applicator. Additional patients along with further IMPT planning will be needed to substantiate the versatility of IMPT planning for APBI."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2013,Brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation versus canadian whole breast hypofractionation: A matched-pair analysis of comparative effectiveness.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): This analysis compares the clinical efficacy, cosmesis and toxicities of two abbreviated radiotherapeutic treatment alternatives for early-stage breast cancer: brachytherapy Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) vs whole breast Canadian hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients were treated between April 1993 and January 2012 with APBI (340 cGy BID in 5 days) or Canadian Hypofractionation (CHfx) to the whole breast (266 cGy/day for 16 fx). The APBI CTV was 1 cm from the surface for balloon devices and 1.5-2 cm from interstitial catheters. For CHfx, the CTV was whole breast without boost irradiation. To compare outcomes, a matched-pair analysis was done using a 1:1 ratio of 85 APBI with 85 CHfx patients. Match criteria were follow-up >1.0 year, clinical stage, age (+/- 1 year), and ER. Outcomes analyzed included ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastasis (DM), contralateral breast failure (CLBF), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Toxicities were graded per CTCAE v.3, and cosmesis per the Harvard criteria. Results: Matched exactly for stage and ER, age (p=.811), nodal stage (p=.350), use of chemotherapy (p=1.0) or hormones (p=.091) were not significantly (NS) different in the matched population. Mean age was 69. With a mean follow-up of 4.7 years (7.2 years APBI vs 2.3 years CHfx, p < 0.001), no differences were seen in the 5-year actuarial rates of IBTR (3% APBI vs 0% CHfx, p=.267), DFS (97% vs 94%, p=.208), and OS (91.0% vs 86%, p=.557). As well, the 5-actuarial rates of RR (2% vs 0%, p=.743), CLBF (0% vs 1%, p=.317), DM (both 0%), or CSS (both 100%) were NS between the APBI and CHfx groups, respectively. Maximal late toxicities were all mild/moderate with no Gr 3 in the APBI group; however, the CHfx had <10% Gr 3 morbidity, manifested mainly by hyperpigmentation. Indeed, of toxicities analyzed, including dermatitis, pigmentary changes, pain, edema, induration, volume reduction, telangiectasias, fat necrosis, and seroma, only chronic Gr 2-3 hyperpigmentation was significant (0% APBI vs 26% CHfx, p < 0.001). Good/excellent cosmetic results were seen in 98% in both groups (p=.976). Conclusions: With a mean follow-up of near 5 years, APBI offers similar treatment efficacy, cosmetic outcome and less morbidity in a more timecompressed treatment course along with sparing dose to the remainder of the breast versus Canadian Hypofractionation. Further follow-up and more patients will be needed to substantiate equivalence of brachytherapy APBI compared with whole breast CHfx, as well as the need for irradiation delivered to a volume beyond that prescribed for APBI in select early-stage breast cancer patients."
"Chen, P. Y., et al.",2015,Fifteen year outcomes of favorable histologies of early-stage breast cancer treated with accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Early-stage breast cancer patients treated with APBI have shown results comparable to whole breast irradiation (WBI). The majority receiving APBI have low-risk clinicopathological features, usually consisting of invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified. This study analyzes the long-term outcomes of Favorable Histological (FH) breast subtypes treated with APBI. Materials/Methods: Between 4/1986 & 1/2013, at a single institute, breast conservation therapy was undertaken in 758 pts treated with APBI, while 3789 pts were treated with WBI. From this database, query was made for favorable histologies, specifically tubular, tubulolobular, mucinous, and medullary subtypes. This yielded 47 such FH cases treated with APBI, and 202 treated with WBI. To compare outcomes, a match-pair analysis was done using a 1:1 ratio with match criteria of follow-up (FU) +/- 5 yrs, age +/- 3 yrs and ER, the latter to emphasize the favorable biology of these low-risk histologies. This resulted in 88 patients, 44 APBI matched to 44 WBI. Actuarial outcomes were assessed including freedom from local recurrence (FFLR), regional recurrence (FFRR), distant metastasis (FFDM), contralateral breast failure (CLBF), disease-free, cause specific, and overall survival (DFS, CSS, OS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. Pt and disease traits were computed using Pearson's χ2 test. Results: Matched for age & ER, the various FHs (p=0.09), PR (p=0.211), Her2 (p=0.322), triple-negative (p=0.439) and use of chemotherapy (p=0.472) were not significantly different in the matched population. However, APBI toWBI for T-stage (T1 98% vs 82% p=0.02), N0 nodal (96% vs 44% p<0.001) and use of endocrine therapy (55% vs 29%, p=0.014) were statistically significant, suggesting selection of WBI in pts with larger index lesions & N+ status. Mean age was 63.7 yrs. With a median FU of 9.0 yrs (1.5-19.5) there was no statistical difference between APBI&WBI in terms of 10- and 15-yr actuarial FFLR, FFRR, FFDM, CLBF, DFS, and CSS. (See Table). The only significance was in OS at 10 and 15 yrs with APBI being superior overWBI at 10 (85% vs 66.3%)&15 yrs (75.5%vs 37.1%), p=0.03. Conclusion: As the natural history of low-grade breast cancers is long & protracted, these 15-yr outcome results of favorable histology breast cancer subtypes demonstrate that APBI is at least as efficacious as WBI in the setting of breast conservation therapy. More patients and further FU beyond 15 years will be needed to substantiate these findings. (Table Presented)."
"Chen, S., et al.",2007,Patterns of Failure After MammoSite Brachytherapy Partial Breast Irradiation: A Detailed Analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To report the results of a detailed analysis of treatment failures after MammoSite breast brachytherapy for partial breast irradiation from our single-institution experience. Methods and Materials: Between October 14, 2002 and October 23, 2006, 78 patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery and accelerated partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. We identified five treatment failures in the 70 patients with >6 months' follow-up. Pathologic data, breast imaging, and radiation treatment plans were reviewed. For in-breast failures more than 2 cm away from the original surgical bed, the doses delivered to the areas of recurrence by partial breast irradiation were calculated. Results: At a median follow-up time of 26.1 months, five treatment failures were identified. There were three in-breast failures more than 2 cm away from the original surgical bed, one failure directly adjacent to the original surgical bed, and one failure in the axilla with synchronous distant metastases. The crude failure rate was 7.1% (5 of 70), and the crude local failure rate was 5.7% (4 of 70). Estimated progression-free survival at 48 months was 89.8% (standard error = 4.5%). Conclusions: Our case series of 70 patients with >6 months' follow-up and a median follow-up of 26 months is the largest single-institution report to date with detailed failure analysis associated with MammoSite brachytherapy. Our failure data emphasize the importance of patient selection when offering partial breast irradiation.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Chen, S., et al.",2019,Delay in Initiating Chemotherapy Beyond 8 Weeks After Breast-Conserving Surgery is Associated with Inferior Survival Outcome for Early-stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate the optimal sequencing of chemotherapy and radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer patients. Materials/Methods: A total of 900 patients with stage T1-2N0-3M0 invasive breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery between 2000 and 2013 were retrospective analyzed. All patients received postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A total of 801(89.0%) patients had stage Ⅰ or Ⅱ diseases. There were 488 patients in the chemotherapy-first group (CT-first) and 412 in the radiotherapy-first group (RT first). Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the rates of loco-regional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS), and the difference was compared with log-rank test. The association of outcome with the sequence of adjuvant therapy (CT-first vs. RT-first) was evaluated using cox proportional hazards regression and further confirmed with propensity-score matching. Results: With median follow-up of 7.1 years (range 1.2-18.6), 27 patients had isolated LRR, 70 had isolated DM, and 16 had LRR with synchronous DM. The median interval between surgery and the start of adjuvant therapy was 4 weeks (range 1 to 13). The median interval between surgery and the start of chemotherapy (SCIT) was 6 weeks (range 1-21) for all patients, 4 weeks (range 1-15) for CT-first group, and 13 weeks (range 6-21) for RT-first group. The median interval between surgery and the start of radiotherapy (SRIT) was 13 weeks (range 2-32) for all patients, 22 weeks (range 5-32) for CT-first group, and 5 weeks (range 2-15) for RT-first group. CT-first group had more patients with risk factors such as node-positive and presence of lymphovascular invasion than RT-first group (both p < 0.001). In the matched analyses (275 patients in each group), CT-first group had significantly higher 10-year DFS rate (91.4% vs. 77.7%, p = 0.013) and lower 10-year DM rate (7.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.033) than RT-first group, but similar LRR and DSS. 96.5% of patients in CT-first group started chemotherapy within 8 weeks after surgery. In univariate analysis, SCIT more than 8 weeks was associated with lower 10-year DFS rate (90.9% vs. 79.5%, p = 0.002) and higher DM rate (8.4% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.027) compared with SCIT less than 8 weeks. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SCIT more than 8 weeks was independently associated with increased risk of DM [hazards ratio (HR) = 2.06, p = 0.001], and decreased DFS (HR = 2.38, p < 0.001) and DSS (HR = 2.04, p = 0.013). When stratiﬁed by stage, SCIT more than 8 weeks was associated with inferior DSS only in patients with T2 or node- positive diseases. Conclusion: Distant metastasis is the main failure pattern for patients with breast cancer after breast-conserving treatment. Delay in initiating chemotherapy beyond 8 weeks after surgery is associated with inferior survival, especially for patients with T2 or node-positive diseases."
"Chen, S., et al.",2017,Prognostic stage groups established by ajcc staging system 8th edition does not significantly improve discrimination over classic TNM staging in early stage breast cancer treated with breast conservative therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The new AJCC staging system 8th edition established the prognostic stage groups for breast cancer, which incorporates biomarkers into classic TNM system to improve discrimination over anatomic stage group. This study is to verify whether AJCC Stage staging system 8th edition is superior to 7thin early stage breast treated with breast conservative therapy, and help to individualize their treatment. Purpose/Objective(s): 1602 patients with T1-2N0-1M0 breast cancer treated from 1999 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. All underwent breast conserving surgery plus axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 1220 patients who had complete information on histological grade, ER, PR and Her2 status were included in this analysis. The median age was 46 years (range, 20-84). 1054 (86.4%) received radiotherapy, 900 (73.8%) received hormone therapy, and 91 (7.5%) received trastuzumab targeted therapy. All patients were restaged according to the new AJCC staging system 8thedition. Locoregional recurrence (LRR), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Results: With a median follow-up of 47 months (IQR, 34-74months), the overall 5-year LRR was 3.6%, 5-year DFS was 93.4%,and 5-year OS was 99.2%. By AJCC 7th staging system, 803 (65.8%) patients had stage IA and 417 (34.2%) had stage IIA diseases. Patients with stage IIA had significant lower DFS than stage IA, but there were no significant difference in OS and LRR between the two groups (Table 1). By AJCC 8th staging system, 608 (49.8%) patients were assigned to a different group, with 250 (41.1%) to a lower stage and 358 (58.9%) to a higher stage. AJCC 8th staging system can help identify a group of patients such as IIIA with significant worse LRR and DFS, but didn't improve discrimination on OS as compared with AJCC 7th staging system (Table 1). Conclusion: For early stage breast cancer treated with breast conservative therapy, AJCC 8th staging system doesn't significantly improve discrimination over classic TNM staging. It might need further investigation on prognostic biomarkers."
"Chen, T. H., et al.",2017,Personalized breast holder (PERSBRA): A new cardiac sparing technique for left-sided whole breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Whole breast irradiation (WBI) is an indispensable component of early breast cancer treatment. Radiation exposure to the heart and to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) during WBI is a risk factor of radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD). Therefore cardiac sparing represents a reasonable risk reduction strategy. The hypothesis is that a PERSonalized BReAst holder (PERSBRA) can reduce radiation exposure to the heart and left anterior descending artery during left-sided WBI. Here we reported the early results. Purpose/Objective(s): 10 participants with left-sided early breast cancer were enrolled in this study. An OpenNI-compatible scanner was used to capture breast contour of the participant in a modified standing forward bend pose. The breast contour was processed into a stereolithography file with an in-house developed image processing workflow. The resultant file was 3D printed with thermoplastic elastomer to fabricate a PERSBRA. Three sets of CT simulation images were acquired in treatment positions (set 1: no PERSBRA; set 2: with PERSBRA; set 3: with PERSBRA and was acquired at 6th day after set 2). Target volumes and normal organs on all 3 sets were contoured by one radiation oncologist, and treatment plans were calculated with Pinnacle to obtain dosimetric profiles. The set 3 was used to analyze reproducibility of the treatment setup. Paired sample T-test was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Numbers were expressed in mean ± SEM. The setup procedure was completed in less than 5 minutes in all 10 cases. The hounsfield number of PERSBRA was-629.3 ± 19.9. By comparing dosimetric parameters obtained from sets 1 and 2, we found that PERSBRA significantly reduced radiation exposure to the heart and lungs (set 1 vs set 2, mean heart dose: 478.4 ± 58.6 vs 346.4 ± 58.9 cGy; mean LAD dose: 1751.1 ± 217.8 versus 1427.3 ± 242.2 cGy; left lung V10: 22.1 ± 0.9 vs 16.8 ± 1.1 %; left lung V20: 16.7 ± 0.8 vs 11.3 ± 0.9 %, all p<0.01). The setup reproducibility was analyzed by comparing sets 2 and 3. Setup errors between sets 2 and 3 were 0.67 ± 0.16, 0.54 ± 0.15, and 0.23 ± 0.14 cm in vertical, lateral and cranial axes, respectively. We also found a reproducible PTV coverage in sets 3 with the same treatment plan obtained from sets 2 (V95% = 95.1 ± 2.7 %, V100% = 88.5 ± 2.9 %, Dmax= 109.4 ± 0.5 %). Conclusion: Our data indicate that PERSBRA is an effective cardiac sparing technique for left-sided WBI. It also effectively reduces radiation exposure to the lungs. Furthermore, it is a friendly and personalized device with minimal setup time and short learning curve. The potential to reduce RIHD with PERSBRA warrants further clinical investigation."
"Chen, W., et al.",2016,The impact of tumor subtypes on outcomes in elderly patients (≥70 years old) with early-stage breast cancer: A population-based study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Randomized trials showed equivalent survival between breast conserving surgery with radiation (BCT) and mastectomy in early stage breast cancer. Retrospective studies have evolved the unique prognosis and response to therapy for each breast cancer subtype. Elderly breast cancer patients comprise a cohort with unique outcomes and limited published findings analyzing the effect of subtype. The purpose of this study is to use the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database to compare breast conserving surgery with radiation therapy (BCT) and mastectomy outcomes for elderly women with each tumor subtype. Materials/Methods: Cases diagnosed from 2010-2012 were obtained from the SEER database with inclusion criteria for women 70 years old and above, diagnosed with T1-2N0M0 as well as known status of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). They were grouped for analysis as: HR+/HER2-, HR-/HER2+, HR+/HER2+, and triple-negative (TN). Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate regression analysis of overall survival (OS) and cause specific survival (CSS) was performed. Results: A total of 13736 patients were identified, of whom 9652 (70.3%) received BCT and 4084 (29.7%) underwent mastectomy. Patient distribution was 82.8% HR+/HER2-, 2.2% HR-/HER2+ , 5.9% HR+/HER2+and 9.1% TN. With a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 1-35 months), women undergoing BCT had improved OS (98.0%VS 95.0%, P<0.001) and CSS (99.7%VS 98.8%, P<0.001) when compared to women with mastectomy. When the patients were subdivided by tumor subtypes, the BCT group continued to show better OS and CSS compared with the mastectomy group in all of the subgroups except HR+/HER2+. In the subtype group of HR+/HER2-, OS and CSS was 98.2% and 99.8% after BCT and 95.8% and 99.3% after mastectomy (both P<0.001). The results were similar for HR-/HER2+ and TN subgroups favoring BCT group. However, no significant difference in CSS was observed between BCT and mastectomy for HR+/HER2+ subgroup ( P = 0.873). Cox Regression analysis showed that BCT resulted in OS (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.40 e 0.61, P<0.001) and CSS (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26-0.65, P<0.001) better than that of mastectomy. The CSS benefit with BCT compared to mastectomy was greater among HR+/HER2-subgroup (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.21e0.77) than among TN subgroup (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21e0.99); however, this trend was not observed among the other two subgroups. Conclusion: Elderly patients (70 years old) with early stage breast cancer who underwent BCT have better CSS and OS compared with those treated with mastectomy alone. These results provide confidence that BCT is an effective alternative to mastectomy for elderly patients with early stage disease regardless of tumor subtypes. Further investigation is warranted."
"Chin, C., et al.",2017,Evaluation of partial breast reirradiation with iort for locally recurrent breast cancer: A single-institution report of outcomes and toxicity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Mastectomy is the current standard of care for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR) after prior whole breast irradiation (WBI). We report our single-institution experience with repeat breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) as an alternative to salvage mastectomy for IBTR. Purpose/Objective(s): We performed an IRB-approved retrospective review of patients treated with breast IORT at our institution between September 2013 and June 2016. We identified 12 patients who declined salvage mastectomy for an IBTR and underwent BCS with IORT in the setting of prior radiation. IORT was delivered using the IntrabeamTM device (Carl Zeiss, Germany). A dose of 20Gy was prescribed to the surface of the lumpectomy cavity using 50kV X-rays. We graded both acute and late treatment-related breast toxicities including breast pain, dermatitis, fibrosis, seroma and infection using the CTCAE version 4.0. Local control, mastectomy-free survival, distant metastasis and overall survival were determined. Results: The median time from prior external beam radiation to presentation was 16 years (2 months-46 years). Nine of our patients developed an IBTR after prior WBI for early-stage breast cancer, 2 with a newly diagnosed breast primary after prior mantle-field radiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma and another with Stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer with prior definitive radiation to the ipsilateral side. At a median follow up of 14 months (4-25 months), there were no events of local or distant recurrence. All women were able to preserve their breast. There was a single non-cancer related death. One patient was pathologically node positive and received adjuvant chemotherapy. In the acute setting, we observed grade 1 toxicity in 7 patients (58%), grade 2 toxicity in 4 (33%). In the late setting, at least 3 months after treatment with IORT, we observed 6 patients with grade 1 dermatitis and/or fibrosis (50%), 3 patients with a symptomatic seroma requiring drainage of which 2 were given oral antibiotic therapy (25%), and a single patient with development of a grade 3 abscess requiring hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic therapy. Conclusion: Comparable to the 3-year toxicity data from RTOG 1014 (grade 2 toxicity in 13/58, 22.4%; grade 3 toxicity in 4/58 6.9%), we observed a significant number of grade 2 and 3 toxicities in the late setting greater than 3 months after treatment. While lumpectomy and IORT is a feasible salvage option for patients with a history of prior mediastinal radiation or desiring breast conservation at the time of IBTR, continued follow-up of these patients is warranted given the incidence of delayed toxicity."
"Chino, F., et al.",2017,Pathologic response and acute toxicity: Planned interim analysis of the phase 2 neort trial evaluating preoperative single fraction partial breast radiation therapy in early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Pre-operative partial breast irradiation (PBI) has been explored as an alternative to adjuvant breast radiotherapy. Practically, this approach has the potential to limit treatment volumes while simultaneously providing an avenue to study breast cancer radiation response. In this Phase II study, we hypothesized that 20% of patients would have a complete pathologic response at surgical resection six weeks after preoperative radiation. Purpose/Objective(s): Histologically confirmed breast cancer patients with ER(+) or PR(+), Her2(-) T1N0 invasive breast cancer or Tis <2cm were enrolled in this single institution, IRB approved, Phase II study delivering 21Gy preoperatively to the intact tumor. Toxicity was scored using CTCAE version 4.0. Any toxicity possibly, probably or definitely related to radiotherapy is reported. Interim analysis was planned to assess complete pathologic response rates, defined as no residual invasive or in-situ tumor. Residual cancer burden (RCB) was also calculated. Results: 20 of 40 planned patients have been enrolled. Three patients were subsequently ineligible on MRI but fifteen have proceeded to surgical resection. Two patients have received radiation but not surgery at the time of this analysis. The median age was 61 (range 58-77), 87% of patients were white and 87% had invasive ductal carcinoma. One patient had a post-operative wound infection and grade 3 seroma requiring drain placement. A second patient had a small area of wound dehiscence with seroma leakage. Remaining toxicities were grade 1-2 and consisted primarily of discomfort, seroma, fatigue and skin change. Pathologic complete response was noted in 1 patient (7%). Another had a pCR by RCB assessment, both with DCIS on pre-treatment biopsy. 5 patients (33%) had an RCB of I, and 8 patients (53%) an RCB of II. Conclusion: Fifteen women with early stage breast cancer have completed a single preoperative fraction of 21Gy followed by surgical resection at six weeks. Two (13%) grade 3 post-operative toxicities and one (7%) pathologic complete response were noted. This interim analysis suggests an increase in post-operative complications relative to our Phase I experience and a low rate of complete pathologic response in invasive disease. We plan to increase accrual in order to better define the optimal timing of surgical excision relative to operative complications and tumor response."
"Chiu, G. and W. W. K. Fung",2014,Acute skin reaction of whole breast irradiation in supine and prone position using tomotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the acute skin reaction of whole breast irradiation in supine and prone position using tomotherapy. Materials/Methods: Between January and December 2013, whenever the patient met the inclusive criteria, they were randomly assigned to the supine or prone group. If the patient could not lie prone for 20 minutes, she would be assigned to the supine group. Inclusive criteria were female patients with early breast cancer receiving radiation therapy after breast conservation surgery and her breast cup size should be C or above and her TNM should be T0-T3, N0- N1a, M0. The score for each patient using acute radiation morbidity scoring criteriawas recorded at the 6th, 11th, 16th and 21st treatment day.Chi-square test (χ2) was used to determine whether there was an association between the different treatment position and the acute skin reaction. Hence, for each treatment day, the null hypothesis states that there was no association between the different treatment position and the acute skin reaction. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it indicates that an association between different treatment position and acute skin reaction. Results: Forty patients were enrolled onto the study, 30 and 10 patients were treated in supine and prone position respectively. There was no Grade 3 and 4 dermatitis found in both groups. Results were summarized in Table 1. At 5% level of significance, only χ2 value at 21st treatment was higher than the critical value (.05) χ2 (4) = 9.49, hence χ2 was significant. Null hypothesis was rejected and there was significant association between acute skin reaction and treatment position. Conclusions: Whole breast irradiation using tomotherapy has significant association between acute skin reaction and treatment position at the end of treatment. Tomotherapy was reported to have better skin sparing in whole breast irradiation, furthermore, from this study prone position can further lower the skin toxicity at the end of treatment. Drawback of using prone position is the patient's stability and comfort. During the recruitment process, many patients withdrew from prone group, therefore the number of patients were uneven in these 2 groups. Further study should look into more comfortable and stable setup to treat in prone position in order to lower the skin toxicity at the end of treatment. (Table Presented)."
"Choi, I. J., et al.",2019,"Clinical Outcomes after Proton Partial-Breast Radiotherapy for Early-Stage, Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: 3-Year Outcomes of a Phase II Trial.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The use of proton therapy (PT) for partial breast irradiation (PBI) in early stage breast cancer is an area of active investigation. Proton PBI has the potential for decreased morbidity versus photon PBI because of superior sparing of surrounding normal breast tissue and underlying thoracic structures with protons. To date, single-institutional studies have reported the feasibility of proton PBI but have resulted in conflicting results on toxicities, with some publications showing suboptimal cosmetic outcomes. Herein, we report 3-year outcomes of a prospective phase II trial investigating the efficacy, toxicity, and cosmetic outcomes of proton PBI. Materials/Methods: This multi-center Proton Collaborative Group phase II trial (PCG BRE 007-12) recruited women ≥50 years of age with AJCC stage 0-2, node negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, ≤3 cm, nonlobular invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ undergoing breast conservation therapy. After breast conserving surgery, proton PBI was delivered to 40 Gy (RBE) in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. All patients received uniform scanning PT except 1 patient who received passively scattered PT; at least 2 treatment fields were used. The study primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Adverse events were prospectively graded using CTCAE version 4.0. The Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BTCOS) was used to assess patient-reported quality of life (QOL) endpoints and cosmesis (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=large). Results: Thirty-eight evaluable patients were enrolled between 2/2013-11/2016. Seventeen patients (45%) had right-sided disease, while 21 patients (55%) had disease of the left breast; median tumor size was 0.95 cm. Median age was 67 years (range 50-79). At a median follow-up of 35 months (range 12-62), all patients were alive, and no patient had local, locoregional or distant disease progression. One patient developed a new ER-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the contralateral breast. Hormone therapy was administered in 29 of 38 patients (76.3%). Seven grade 2 adverse events occurred (radiation dermatitis (n=1, 2.6%), lymphedema (n=1, 2.6%), hot flashes (n=3, 7.9%), dyspnea (n=1, 2.6%) and fatigue (n=1, 2.6%)). No acute grade ≥3 acute or late toxicity attributable to radiotherapy were observed. Five patients (13%) assigned a BTCOS score of 4 at 1- or 3-year follow-up for change in nipple appearance (n=3), breast shape (n=4), scar tissue formation (n=2), breast texture (n=1) and bra fit (n=1). The median volume of the heart receiving 5 Gy (heart V5Gy) was 0%; lung V20Gy was 0% and V10Gy was 0.17%. Conclusion: At 3 years, proton PBI provides 100% cancer control for early stage, ER-positive breast cancer. Acute toxicities are minimal, and patient-reported QOL remains acceptable with continued follow-up. These findings, together with the excellent dosimetric sparing of critical organs achieved with proton PBI, provide evidence that proton PBI is a safe and effective option for the delivery of PBI."
"Choi, S., et al.",2017,Locoregional treatment of the primary tumor shows survival benefit in de novo stage IV breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Although systemic therapy is a mainstay of treatment for metastatic breast cancer, the role of locoregional treatment (LRT) of the primary tumor for an overall survival advantage is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes of patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer after undergoing LRT of the primary site. Purpose/Objective(s): From January 2006 to November 2013, a total of 245 patients diagnosed with de novo stage IV breast cancer at Yonsei University Health System were included. Among them, LRT of primary tumor (+ systemic therapy) was performed in 86 patients (35%) (Surgery only: n = 28, surgery + radiotherapy (RT): n = 47, RT only: n = 11). The remaining 155 patients (63%) received systemic therapies (chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy), while 4 patients (2%) received no treatment. For surgery type, 87% (n = 66) received mastectomy, and 12% (n = 9) received breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated, and propensity score matching method was used to balance groups. Results: The median follow-up duration was 40 months (Range, 13 days to 124 months). The 5-year LRFS and OS rates were 27% and 50%, respectively. Total of 188 patients (77%) experienced recurrence, while local recurrence rate was 45% (LRT group 12% vs. no LRT group 47%, p <0.001) and systemic recurrence rate was 95% (LRT group 69% vs. no LRT group 76%, p=0.248). Advanced T stage (T4), liver or brain metastasis, ≥5 metastatic sites, no hormone therapy, and LRT(-) were considered significant adverse factors for LRFS, while T4 stage, no hormone therapy, and LRT(-) were considered significant for OS. LRT group demonstrated favorable outcome (5-year LRFS: 55% and 5-year OS: 71%), especially when surgery was performed. Even after matching the baseline characteristics, survival rates were still significantly higher in LRT group than no LRT group (5-year LRFS 55% vs. 22%, p<0.001, 5-year OS 71% vs. 43%, p<0.001). Furthermore, LRT (especially surgery) was an important good prognostic factor in patients with <T4 stage tumors, no liver or brain metastasis, and <5 metastatic sites in subgroup analysis. For the type of surgery, BCS + RT was not inferior to other LRTs, although more patients with early stage tumors or ≤2 sites, without lung/liver/distant lymph node metastasis, were included. For the role of post-mastectomy RT, treatment results were higher (5-year LRFS 61% vs. 50%, OS 74% vs. 68%) with RT in selected T/N stage (≥N2, ≥T3, or T2N1) of patients. Conclusion: LRT including RT, together with systemic therapies, is an important option in selected de novo stage IV breast cancer patients, especially when the burden of the tumor is low. Furthermore, BCS + RT would be a possible substitute for mastectomy without compromising oncologic outcome in early stage metastatic breast cancer. Post-mastectomy RT should be re-evaluated in light of the advances in systemic therapy, with improving survival in stage IV disease."
"Choi, S. H., et al.",2019,The Effect of Regional Node Irradiation on the Thyroid Gland in the Breast Cancer Patients: The Clinical Significance of Optimization of Radiation Target Volume.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Although current international consensus recommends considering regional node irradiation (RNI) even in high-risk early-stage breast cancer, the risk of radiotherapy (RT)-related late toxicities including radiation-induced-hypothyroidism (RIH) has been neglected so far. Here, we investigated the long-term contribution of RNI on the risk of RIH and whether optimizing RT target volumes for supraclavicular (SCV) lymph node could minimize its risk. Materials/Methods: We identified 4,073 patients who received adjuvant RT after surgery for breast cancer between 2007 and 2016 at a single institution. Patients were divided into three groups by the volume of regional RT field: no RNI (n=2,468), low SCV-RNI (cranial border at the subclavian artery according to ESTRO guideline, n=215), and standard-RNI (cranial border at the cricoid cartilage according to RTOG atlas, n=1,390). Development of subclinical or biochemical RIH was evaluated by medical chart review. The incidences of hypothyroidism were compared among three groups, and the dosimetric analysis was performed to estimate the Dmean to the thyroid in randomly-sampled matching patients (n = 200). Results: At a median of 60 months (range, 5.2-140.2), 89 patients (2.2%) developed RIH (1.5% subclinical, 0.7% biochemical). The time interval from RT to detection of hypothyroidism was mean 30.2±24.0 months, and the 3- and 5-year rates were 1.3% and 2.2%. Patients with RNI had a significantly higher rate of hypothyroidism than patients without RNI (3.4% vs. 1.4%, P<.001). In RNI group (n = 1,605), low SCV-RNI was significantly associated with lowered risk of hypothyroidism than standard-RNI (0.5% vs. 3.8%, P<.001). After adjusting all confounders, standard-RNI was the only independent risk factor for development of RIH (vs. low SCV, HR 1.46, 95% CI, 1.05-2.03). In the dosimetric analysis, mean radiation dose to the thyroid was significantly lowered in low SCV-RNI group than standard-RNI group (2.9±1.9 Gy vs. 9.3±8.4 Gy P<.001). Conclusion: Standard supraclavicular lymph node irradiation increased the risk of newly developed hypothyroidism. However, optimization of RT target volume could reduce the lifelong RIH risk, which further supports adoption of smaller volume for supraclavicular lymph node in breast cancer with limited nodal tumor burden."
"Chu, A. M., et al.",1980,Treatment of early stage breast cancer by limited surgery and radical irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"85 Female patients with early stage breast cancer, i.e., Stage I and II were treated by limited surgery followed by radical radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital between January, 1956, and December, 1974. Patients included those who were medically inoperable or who refused mastectomy. The 5-year survival rate was 83% and 76% for Stage I and II, respectively. The corresponding disease free survival (absolute) was 67% and 42%. Although the number of patients so treated is small, there was no significant difference in survival from the results of the radical mastectomy series at the same institution. No major complications were encountered. Seventeen of eighty-five patients developed minor problems; mostly fibrosis and minimal arm lymphedema stemming from older orthovoltage equipment and treatment techniques. With the current availability of megavoltage equipment, improvements in techniques and dosimetry, complications should decrease. Combined limited surgery and radical radiation therapy should be considered in those patients where a radical mastectomy is not feasible because of psychological or medical problems. Since this procedure results in a cosmetically acceptable breast, radical radiation in early stage breast cancer seems a reasonable alternative to radical mastectomy."
"Chua, M., et al.",2012,Dna double-strand break repair and induction of apoptosis in relation to late normal tissue responses following radiation therapy for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): In this study, we assessed if induction of apoptosis following ex vivo irradiation of G0 blood lymphocytes correlated with clinical radiosensitivity and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in breast radiation therapy patients. Using small molecule inhibitors, we examined the relationship between DSB repair and radiation-induced apoptosis. Materials/Methods: Breast cancer patients with minimal (controls) or marked late radiation-induced changes (cases) were selected. DSB were quantified by gH2AX/53BP1 immunostaining 0.5 and 24 hours after exposure of lymphocytes to 0.5 and 4 Gy, respectively. Induction of apoptosis was assessed 48 h after 8 Gy using a fluorochrome inhibitor of caspases (FLICA) assay. Apoptotic cells were defined by small cell size and positive FLICA signal, measured using flow cytometry. To inhibit DSB non-homologous end-joining and ATM-p53-dependent apoptosis, small molecule DNA-PK (Nu7441) and ATM (Ku55933) inhibitors were used at concentrations of 1 mM and 10 μM, respectively. Results: Despite similar foci induction at 0.5 hour, residual foci levels 24 hours after 4 Gy differed significantly between cases and controls (Foci per cell = 12.7 in cases, n = 8 vs. 10.3 in controls, n = 8, p = 0.002). In contrast to residual foci levels, comparable levels of apoptosis were observed between cases and controls 48 h after 8 Gy. Mean proportion of apoptotic cells was 37.2% in cases and 34.7% in controls (p = 0.413). Residual foci levels were not correlated with levels of apoptosis in lymphocytes of the same patients (R = -0.059, p = 0.785). To determine if apoptosis is modulated by DSB repair signaling, apoptosis measurements were repeated in lymphocytes treated with Nu7441. We observed that Nu7441-treated cells had higher levels of residual foci and apoptosis 48 hours after 1 Gy compared to mock-treated cells. This effect was wholly dependent on an active ATM function as cells treated simultaneously with Nu7441 and Ku55933 had extremely low levels of apoptosis, comparable to levels observed in cells treated with Ku55933 alone. Last, we report a unique case of clinical radiosensitivity associated with a possible defect in DNAPK-dependent end-joining. Conclusions: Clinical radiosensitivity may be associated with a defective DSB repair in some patients. Separately, induction of apoptosis appears to be dependent on DSB end-joining following exposure to ionizing radiation."
"Ciervide, R., et al.",2012,Five year outcome of 145 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after accelerated breast radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: Accelerated whole-breast radiotherapy (RT) with tumor bed boost in the treatment of early invasive breast cancer has demonstrated equivalent local control and cosmesis when compared with standard RT. Its efficacy in the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains unknown. Methods and Materials: Patients treated for DCIS with lumpectomy and negative margins were eligible for 2 consecutive hypofractionated whole-breast RT clinical trials. The first trial (New York University [NYU] 01-51) prescribed to the whole breast 42 Gy (2.8 Gy in 15 fractions) and the second trial (NYU 05-181) 40.5 Gy (2.7 Gy in 15 fractions) with an additional daily boost of 0.5 Gy to the surgical cavity. Results: Between 2002 and 2009, 145 DCIS patients accrued, 59 to the first protocol and 86 to the second trial. Median age was 56 years and 65% were postmenopausal at the time of treatment. Based on optimal sparing of normal tissue, 79% of the patients were planned and treated prone and 21% supine. At 5 years' median follow-up (60 months; range 2.6-105.5 months), 6 patients (4.1%) experienced an ipsilateral breast recurrence in all cases of DCIS histology. In 3/6 patients, recurrence occurred at the original site of DCIS and in the remaining 3 cases outside the original tumor bed. New contralateral breast cancers arose in 3 cases (1 DCIS and 2 invasive carcinomas). Cosmetic self-assessment at least 2 years after treatment is available in 125 patients: 91% reported good-to-excellent and 9% reported fair-to-poor outcomes. Conclusions: With a median follow-up of 5 years, the ipsilateral local recurrence rate is 4.1%, comparable to that reported from the NSABP (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) trials that employed 50 Gy in 25 fractions of radiotherapy for DCIS. There were no invasive recurrences. These results provide preliminary evidence that accelerated hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy is a viable option for DCIS.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Cohen, R. J., et al.",2012,Improved survival with adjuvant radiation in elderly women with early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) studied the addition of radiation to lumpectomy and tamoxifen in women age 70 and older with clinical stage I, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. At a median follow-up of 10.5 years, there was an absolute reduction of 6% in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with the use of radiation, but there was no improvement in overall survival (OS) or causespecific survival (CSS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate survival outcomes of elderly women with ER+, early stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and radiation versus lumpectomy alone using a large, population-based database. Materials/Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized to obtain data for all women ages 70 to 84 years old diagnosed with T1 N0 M0, ER+, breast cancer between 1990 and 2008 who underwent lumpectomy with or without adjuvant radiation therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate OS and CSS. Results: Twenty-nine thousand, one hundred twenty-seven women who survived at least one year following initial breast cancer diagnosis were identified. Median follow-up was 10 years. Fifty percent of patients received adjuvant radiation.With increasing age, the use of adjuvant radiation decreased with 55%of women age 70-74, 50%of women 75-79, and 40%of women 80- 84 years old receiving external beam radiation. At 5 years, CSS was 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 97.3%-97.8%) for surgery alone versus 98.3% (95%CI: 94.9%-95.8%) for adjuvant radiation. The improvement in CSSwith the addition of radiation persisted at 10 years: 94.3%(95% CI: 93.8%-94.8%) versus 95.4% (95% CI: 94.9%-95.8%), (p < 0.05). The median survival was 11.1 years for patients receiving surgery alone and 13.1 years for surgery and radiation. The OS was significantly better at all time points for women receiving radiation. At 5, 10, and 15 years, the OS was 83.0%, 56.1%, and 30.2% for those treated with surgery alone compared to 89.5%, 66.8%, and 40.8% treated with surgery and radiation (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Elderly women with early stage breast cancer treated with surgery and adjuvant radiation have improved outcomes compared to those treated with surgery alone, likely related to an improvement in locoregional control. The patients selected for radiation were likely healthier with longer anticipated life expectancy. However, even in the surgery alone patients, median survival was 11.1 years. Although information regarding hormonal therapy usage is not available, the improvement in CSS with the addition of radiation suggests that in healthy, elderly women, adjuvant radiation should be strongly considered as part of their breast cancer treatment."
"Cohen, R. J., et al.",2013,Adjuvant radiation improves breast cancer specific survival in the eldest early-stage breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The omission of radiation following breast conserving surgery in elderly women with favorable, early stage breast cancer did not impact overall or breast cancer specific survival in several clinical trials. The purpose of our study was to evaluate survival outcomes of women age 85 and greater with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery with or without adjuvant radiation using a population-based database. Materials/Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized to obtain data for all women aged 85 years and older diagnosed with T1 N0 M0, ER+ breast cancer between 1990 and 2009 who underwent breast conserving surgery with or without adjuvant Radiation therapy and had at least one year of follow-up. The Kaplan- Meier method was used to calculate overall survival (OS) and cause specific survival (CSS). Results: Three thousand four hundred fifty-seven women were identified. Median age was 87 years. Thirty-five percent of patients received adjuvant radiation. The median OS was 5.5 years for those treated with surgery and 7 years for patients treated with surgery and radiation (p < 0.0001). The 5 and 10-year CSS was 95% and 88%, respectively, for patients treated with surgery alone versus 97% and 93% for patients treated with surgery plus radiation (p=0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the addition of radiation was significantly associated with OS and CSS when adjusting for other confounding factors. Conclusions: The eldest women with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving therapy have improved survival outcomes compared to those with radiation omitted. The patients selected for radiation were likely healthier with longer anticipated life expectancy. Adjuvant radiation should be reviewed with elderly women, regardless of age, and evaluated for Radiation therapy as part of their breast conserving therapy."
"Coles, C. E., et al.",2017,"Partial-breast radiotherapy after breast conservation surgery for patients with early breast cancer (UK IMPORT LOW trial): 5-year results from a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.",The Lancet,"Background Local cancer relapse risk after breast conservation surgery followed by radiotherapy has fallen sharply in many countries, and is influenced by patient age and clinicopathological factors. We hypothesise that partial-breast radiotherapy restricted to the vicinity of the original tumour in women at lower than average risk of local relapse will improve the balance of beneficial versus adverse effects compared with whole-breast radiotherapy. Methods IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done in 30 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Women aged 50 years or older who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for unifocal invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of grade 1–3, with a tumour size of 3 cm or less (pT1–2), none to three positive axillary nodes (pN0–1), and minimum microscopic margins of non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy and 40 Gy to the partial breast (reduced-dose group), or 40 Gy to the partial breast only (partial-breast group) in 15 daily treatment fractions. Computer-generated random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were used to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by radiotherapy treatment centre. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. Field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered using standard tangential beams that were simply reduced in length for the partial-breast group. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local relapse (80% power to exclude a 2·5% increase [non-inferiority margin] at 5 years for each experimental group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the local relapse hazard ratio [HR] was less than 2·03), analysed by intention to treat. Safety analyses were done in all patients for whom data was available (ie, a modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN12852634. Findings Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 women were recruited. Two women withdrew consent for use of their data in the analysis. 674 patients were analysed in the whole-breast radiotherapy (control) group, 673 in the reduced-dose group, and 669 in the partial-breast group. Median follow-up was 72·2 months (IQR 61·7–83·2), and 5-year estimates of local relapse cumulative incidence were 1·1% (95% CI 0·5–2·3) of patients in the control group, 0·2% (0·02–1·2) in the reduced-dose group, and 0·5% (0·2–1·4) in the partial-breast group. Estimated 5-year absolute differences in local relapse compared with the control group were −0·73% (−0·99 to 0·22) for the reduced-dose and −0·38% (−0·84 to 0·90) for the partial-breast groups. Non-inferiority can be claimed for both reduced-dose and partial-breast radiotherapy, and was confirmed by the test against the critical HR being more than 2·03 (p=0·003 for the reduced-dose group and p=0·016 for the partial-breast group, compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy group). Photographic, patient, and clinical assessments recorded similar adverse effects after reduced-dose or partial-breast radiotherapy, including two patient domains achieving statistically significantly lower adverse effects (change in breast appearance [p=0·007 for partial-breast] and breast harder or firmer [p=0·002 for reduced-dose and p<0·0001 for partial-breast]) compared with whole-breast radiotherapy. Interpretation We showed non-inferiority of partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy compared with the standard whole-breast radiotherapy in terms of local relapse in a cohort of patients with early breast cancer, and equivalent or fewer late normal-tissue adverse effects were seen. This simple radiotherapy technique is implementable in radiotherapy centres worldwide. Funding Cancer Research UK."
"Cooper, B. T., et al.",2013,A clinical planning tool to predict left anterior descending coronary artery maximum dose based on distance to the tangent field edge.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A significant increase in mortality from heart disease, that is sustained 15 years following radiation therapy to the left breast, was demonstrated in a large SEER registry study (Darby et al., Lancet Oncol 2005). Radiation exposure to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is a major cause of this complication. While the mean LAD dose is often reported, the maximum dose to the LAD (LADmax) may be more relevant, since even a small occlusion of the artery may result in severe perfusion defects. We studied our clinical dosimetry database to determine which distance from the edge of the field will consistently assure that LADmax is <10 Gy, a dose shown to cause coronary sclerosis (Baker J et al., Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2009). Materials/Methods: The LAD was contoured for 147 early stage breast cancer trial patients treated in the prone position. This series enabled adequate representation of anatomic variability and different post-surgical cavity size and location. The whole breast received 270 cGy with an additional concomitant boost to the post-surgical cavity of 50 cGy a day, over 15 fractions (4800 cGy total). For each patient, the distance from the tangent field edge to the LADmax was measured using the Eclipse treatment planning software. The dose versus distance relationship, within one standard deviation from the mean in both directions, was fit using linear regression. For 52 patients who were simulated and planned both prone and supine, we tested the applicability of this approach to the supine set-up. Results: As expected, the LADmax was the closest point between the LAD and the edge of the field. The mean LADmax using the prone set-up (n=147) was 1796 ± 1431 cGy. The mean distance from the field edge to the LADmax was 2 ± 6.8 mm. For patients with field edge to LADmax distance within one standard deviation of the mean, the dose versus distance relationship was linear [LADmax (cGy) = -324∗distance from field edge (mm) +213 (R2=0.91)]. Greater than 2.2 mm was required to maintain an LADmax < 10 Gy. The LADmax versus distance relationship followed a similar distribution in the supine set-up. For the 52 cases with dosimetry available in both positions the mean distance from field edge to LADmax was significantly more when prone versus supine, 0.8 mm versus -3.6 mm (p = 0.002). Conclusions: In the series analyzed, the LADmax was consistently kept below 10 Gy when the posterior edge of the tangent field was situated greater than 2.2 mm from the LADmax point, regardless of boost cavity size, boost cavity location, field size, or patient breast separation. When designing tangent fields for breast radiation therapy, a relationship to keep in mind is that for every millimeter between the field edge and the closest point of the LAD the dose will change by approximately 3 Gy, within the most commonly encountered treatment conditions."
"Corica, T., et al.",2016,Cosmesis and Breast-Related Quality of Life Outcomes After Intraoperative Radiation Therapy for Early Breast Cancer: A Substudy of the TARGIT-A Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To report the first comprehensive investigation of patient-reported cosmesis and breast-related quality of life (QOL) outcomes comparing patients randomized to risk-adapted single-dose intraoperative radiation therapy (TARGIT-IORT) versus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on the TARGIT-A trial. Methods and Materials Longitudinal cosmesis and QOL data were collected from a subset of TARGIT-A participants who received TARGIT-IORT as a separate procedure (postpathology). Patients completed a cosmetic assessment before radiation therapy and annually thereafter for at least 5 years. Patients also completed the combined European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire and Breast-Specific Module in addition to the Body Image after Breast Cancer Questionnaire at baseline and annually thereafter. The combined EORTC questionnaires were also collected 3, 6, and 9 months after wide local excision. Results An Excellent–Good cosmetic result was scored more often than a Fair–Poor result for both treatment groups across all time points. The TARGIT-IORT patients reported better breast-related QOL than EBRT patients. Statistically and clinically significant differences were seen at month 6 and year 1, with EBRT patients having moderately worse breast symptoms (a statistically significant difference of more than 10 in a 100-point scale) than TARGIT-IORT patients at these time points. Conclusion Patients treated with TARGIT-IORT on the TARGIT-A trial have similar self-reported cosmetic outcome but better breast-related QOL outcomes than patients treated with EBRT. This important evidence can facilitate the treatment decision-making process for patients who have early breast cancer suitable for breast-conserving surgery and inform their clinicians."
"Cormack, R. A. and P. M. Devlin",2008,Brachytherapy Partial Breast Irradiation: Analyzing Effect of Source Configurations on Dose Metrics Relevant to Toxicity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Recently, the use of partial breast irradiation (PBI) for patients with early-stage breast cancer with low-risk factors has increased. The volume of the high-dose regions has been correlated with toxicity in interstitial treatment. Although no such associations have been made in applicator-based experience, new applicators are being developed that use complex noncentered source configurations. This work studied the effect of noncentered source placements on the volume of the high-dose regions around a spherical applicator. Methods and Materials: Many applicator configurations were numerically simulated for a range of inflation radii. For each configuration, a dose homogeneity index was used as a dose metric to measure the volume of the high-dose region. Results: All multisource configurations examined resulted in an increase of the high-dose region compared with a single-center source. The resulting decrease in the prescription dose homogeneity index was more pronounced for sources further from the center of the applicator, and the effect was reduced as the number of dwell locations was increased. Conclusion: The geometries of particular applicators were not considered to achieve a more general result. On the basis of the calculations of this work, it would appear that treatment using noncentered dwell locations will lead to an increase in the volume of the high-dose regions.  Inc.

"Corradini, S., et al.",2019,Mastectomy or Breast-Conserving Therapy for Early Breast Cancer in Real-Life Clinical Practice: Outcome Comparison of 7565 Cases.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Although the organ preservation strategy by breast conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy (BCT) has revolutionized the treatment approach of early stage breast cancer (BC), the choice between treatment options in this setting can still vary according to patient preferences. Aim of the present study was to compare the oncological outcome of mastectomy versus breast conserving therapy in patients treated in a modern clinical setting outside of clinical trials. Materials/Methods: 7565 women diagnosed with early invasive BC (pT1/2pN0/1) between 1998 and 2014 were included in this study (median follow-up: 95.2 months). In order to reduce selection bias and confounding, a subgroup analysis of a matched 1:1 case-control cohort consisting of 1802 patients was performed (median follow-up 109.4 months). Results: Patients treated with BCT were significantly younger, with a median age at diagnosis of 58.2 years in the BCT group, as compared to 59.3 years in the mastectomy group (p<0.001). Furthermore, patients treated with mastectomy presented with more high-risk features such as tumor size ≥20mm (43.1%), positive lymph nodes (31.4%), high tumor grade (27.3%) and negative hormone receptor status (12.0%) than patients receiving BCT. Moreover, mastectomy patients received less adjuvant endocrine therapy (52.0% vs. 43.5%, p<0.001). In the matched cohort, we controlled for all these imbalances. After adjusting for age, tumor characteristics and therapies, multivariable analysis for local recurrence-free survival identified BCT as an independent predictor for improved local control (hazard ratio [HR]:1.517; 95%confidence interval:1.092-2.108, p=0.013) as compared to mastectomy alone in the matched cohort. Ten-year cumulative incidence (CI) of lymph node recurrences was 2.0% following BCT, compared to 5.8% in patients receiving mastectomy (p<0.001). Similarly, 10-year distant-metastasis-free survival (89.4% vs 85.5%, p=0.013) was impaired in patients undergoing mastectomy alone. This translated into improved survival in patients treated with BCT (10-year OS estimates 85.3% vs 79.3%, p<0.001), which was also significant on multivariable analysis (p=0.011). Conclusion: Many previous studies have performed similar analyses with comparable results. However, a specific characterizing element of the present study is the additional matched case control analysis. In conclusion, the present study showed that patients treated with BCS followed by radiotherapy had an improved outcome compared to radical mastectomy alone - even in the matched cohort. Specifically, local control, distant control, and overall survival were significantly better using the conservative approach. Thus, as a result of the present study, physicians should encourage patients to receive BCS with radiotherapy rather than mastectomy, whenever it is medically feasible and appropriate."
"Correa, C., et al.",2017,Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation: Executive summary for the update of an ASTRO Evidence-Based Consensus Statement.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Purpose To update the accelerated partial breast irradiation Consensus Statement published in 2009 and provide guidance on use of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for partial breast irradiation in early-stage breast cancer, based on published evidence complemented by expert opinion. Methods and materials A systematic PubMed search using the same terms as the original Consensus Statement yielded 419 articles; 44 articles were selected. The authors synthesized the published evidence and, through a series of conference calls and e-mails, reached consensus regarding the recommendations. Results The new recommendations include lowering the age in the “suitability group” from 60 to 50 years and in the “cautionary group” to 40 years for patients who meet all other elements of suitability (Table 1). Patients with low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ, as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9804 criteria, were categorized in the “suitable” group. The task force agreed to maintain the current criteria based on margin status. Recommendations for the use of IORT for breast cancer patients include: counseling patients regarding the higher risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with IORT compared with whole breast irradiation; the need for prospective monitoring of long-term local control and toxicity with low-energy radiograph IORT given limited follow-up; and restriction of IORT to women with invasive cancer considered “suitable.” Conclusion These recommendations will provide updated clinical guidance regarding use of accelerated partial breast irradiation for radiation oncologists and other specialists participating in the care of breast cancer patients."
"Correa, C. R., et al.",2008,Association Between Tangential Beam Treatment Parameters and Cardiac Abnormalities After Definitive Radiation Treatment for Left-Sided Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To examine the association between radiation treatment (RT) parameters, cardiac diagnostic test abnormalities, and clinical cardiovascular diagnoses among patients with left-sided breast cancer after breast conservation treatment with tangential beam RT. Methods and Materials: The medical records of 416 patients treated between 1977 and 1995 with RT for primary left-sided breast cancer were reviewed for myocardial perfusion imaging and echocardiograms. Sixty-two patients (62/416, 15%) underwent these cardiac diagnostic tests for cardiovascular symptoms and were selected for further study. Central lung distance and maximum heart width and length in the treatment field were determined for each patient. Medical records were reviewed for cardiovascular diagnoses and evaluation of cardiac risk factors. Results: At a median of 12 years post-RT the incidence of cardiac diagnostic test abnormalities among symptomatic left-sided irradiated women was significantly higher than the predicted incidence of cardiovascular disease in the patient population, 6/62 (9%) predicted vs. 24/62 (39%) observed, p = 0.001. As compared with patients with normal tests, patients with cardiac diagnostic test abnormalities had a larger median central lung distance (2.6 cm vs. 2.2 cm, p = 0.01). Similarly, patients with vs. without congestive heart failure had a larger median central lung distance (2.8 cm vs. 2.3 cm, p = 0.008). Conclusions: Contemporary RT for early breast cancer may be associated with a small, but potentially avoidable, risk of cardiovascular morbidity that is associated with treatment technique.  Inc.

"Croog, V. J., et al.",2009,Accelerated Whole Breast Irradiation With Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy to the Prone Breast.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Whole breast irradiation (WBI) is the standard of care for patients with early-stage breast cancer who opt for breast conservation. After a randomized trial demonstrated equivalent cosmesis and disease control with accelerated WBI (AWBI), our institution began to offer AWBI to appropriate patients. The aim of this study was to examine our unique experience with AWBI using prone positioning and simplified intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning with a sequential boost to the tumor bed. Methods and Materials: We identified 356 patients who had been treated with prone WBI using IMRT in our department between January 2004 and December 2006. Of these, 128 (36%) patients had received AWBI (representing 131 treated breasts), consisting of 16 daily fractions of 265 cGy to a total dose of 4,240 cGy followed by a conventionally fractionated boost. Results: Patients who opted for AWBI were similar demographically to the patients undergoing conventional WBI. In the AWBI cohort, 83% of the patients had Stage T1 disease and 22% had nodal involvement (N1). The tumors were estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive and Her-2/Neu-amplified in 82%, 69%, and 11%, respectively. The median duration of AWBI plus a boost was 29 days, and no patient required a toxicity-related treatment break. No Grade 3 or greater acute toxicity developed. At a median follow-up of 18 months, one ipsilateral breast recurrence developed that was salvaged with mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. Conclusion: AWBI to the prone breast using simplified IMRT with a sequential boost offers women requiring breast-only adjuvant radiotherapy an abbreviated treatment with early tumor control and cosmesis comparable to that with standard fractionation."
"Crook, J. M., et al.",2019,Permanent Breast Seed Implant for Partial-Breast Radiotherapy Following Partial Mastectomy for Favorable Breast Cancer: Results for 67 patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adjuvant partial breast radiotherapy (PBRT) is standard of care for early stage favorable breast cancer according to GEC-ESTRO, ASTRO, and ABS Guidelines. Modalities include both external bream and brachytherapy. We hypothesize that PBRT delivered by Low Dose Rate brachytherapy permanent breast seed implants (PBSI) as a single 2-hour procedure would be well received and well tolerated. Materials/Methods: From 07/12-10/18, 67 postmenopausal women with unifocal T1N0 invasive ductal breast cancer or DCIS, ER positive, negative margins, grade 1 or 2, and no LVI received PBRT using permanent implantation of stranded Pd-103 seeds on an REB approved Phase 2 trial. Following breast conserving surgery, PBSI delivered 90 Gy to the seroma + margin (1.25 to 1.5cm: max PTV 125 cc). Implants were planned with CT simulation and performed as an outpatient procedure under light anesthesia, guided by live ultrasound (US). Visualization of the seroma on both CT and US is essential. Post implant CT dosimetry used fusion with the original planning scan for seroma delineation. Evaluations were at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months and then annually. Results: More than 95% of women suitable by oncologic criteria would consent to PBSI. Only about 40% are technically suitable due to seroma volume, location, or lack of visibility on CT or US. For 67 patients, median seroma volume was 6.6 cc (1.7-20.4), PTV 61 cc (31-117), # of needles 18 (10-30) and seeds 75 (42-134). In Day 0 dosimetry, median seroma D90 was 132 Gy (V100:97%), seroma+ 5mm 106 Gy (V100:93%) and seroma+10mm 80 Gy (V100:85%). Seroma location was 58% lateral, 31% anterior, 9% inframammary fold and one lower inner quadrant. The local reaction peaks at 6 weeks and is limited to the skin overlying the implant: 51% had grade 1 erythema, 12% superficial desquamation. Needle puncture marks are not visible at 4 weeks. Late reactions (> 2 years) are generally minimal: 35% no sequelae, 43% localized palpable asymptomatic fibrosis, 20% minimally apparent telangiectasia (6% more significant but asymptomatic), 22% slight lateral contour change or skin dimpling. All cases with more pronounced breast contour change (n=6) followed deforming surgery (nipple excision, marked post-operative nipple deviation, etc.). With a minimum of 6 months follow-up, 94% of respondents were “very satisfied” or “totally satisfied.” At a median follow up of 3.3 years (6-75 months), there has been one in-breast recurrence (different quadrant) detected at 12 months and treated with mastectomy at the patient’s request. Three patients have had biopsies of palpable fibrosis, all negative for malignancy. Two patients have had contralateral breast cancers, one of whom had partial mastectomy followed by a second PBSI, while the other opted for bilateral mastectomy for reasons of cancer anxiety despite satisfaction with the first procedure. Conclusion: Our experience with PBSI for PBRT is favorable with a high patient acceptance and satisfaction, excellent early efficacy and very satisfactory cosmesis."
"Cuaron, J. J., et al.",2015,Early toxicity in patients treated with postoperative proton therapy for locally advanced breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To report dosimetry and early toxicity data in breast cancer patients treated with postoperative proton radiation therapy. Methods and Materials From March 2013 to April 2014, 30 patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer and no history of prior radiation were treated with proton therapy at a single proton center. Patient characteristics and dosimetry were obtained through chart review. Patients were seen weekly while on treatment, at 1 month after radiation therapy completion, and at 3- to 6-month intervals thereafter. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Frequencies of toxicities were tabulated. Results Median dose delivered was 50.4 Gy (relative biological equivalent [RBE]) in 5 weeks. Target volumes included the breast/chest wall and regional lymph nodes including the internal mammary lymph nodes (in 93%). No patients required a treatment break. Among patients with >3 months of follow-up (n=28), grade 2 dermatitis occurred in 20 patients (71.4%), with 8 (28.6%) experiencing moist desquamation. Grade 2 esophagitis occurred in 8 patients (28.6%). Grade 3 reconstructive complications occurred in 1 patient. The median planning target volume V95 was 96.43% (range, 79.39%-99.60%). The median mean heart dose was 0.88 Gy (RBE) [range, 0.01-3.20 Gy (RBE)] for all patients, and 1.00 Gy (RBE) among patients with left-sided tumors. The median V20 of the ipsilateral lung was 16.50% (range, 6.1%-30.3%). The median contralateral lung V5 was 0.34% (range, 0%-5.30%). The median maximal point dose to the esophagus was 45.65 Gy (RBE) [range, 0-65.4 Gy (RBE)]. The median contralateral breast mean dose was 0.29 Gy (RBE) [range, 0.03-3.50 Gy (RBE)]. Conclusions Postoperative proton therapy is well tolerated, with acceptable rates of skin toxicity. Proton therapy favorably spares normal tissue without compromising target coverage. Further follow-up is necessary to assess for clinical outcomes and cardiopulmonary toxicities."
"Currey, A. D., et al.",2012,The importance of 3-dimensional CT treatment planning to optimize outcomes from accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with brachytherapy in early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): While we await outcomes from randomized studies, APBI has seen increasing use as an alternative to whole breast irradiation (WBI) after lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer. Recently, there has been concern generated about excess toxicity associated with brachytherapy APBI. Multi-catheter (MCT) brachytherapy, as the initial APBI method developed, has the longest follow-up, and provides a means for looking at late outcomes. Material/Methods: Between 1998 and 2008, 75 patients underwent MCT PBI. The patients had median age 70 years; 7% Tis, 81% T1, 12% T2; 5% node positive, 91% were ER positive, 79% got anti-endocrine therapy, and 9% got chemotherapy. Three dimensional conformal CT planning (3DCT) was done for 58, 52 had plans available for analysis. A 2 plane implant was done in 21%, 3 plane for 57%. Mean number of catheters was 17. Dose was prescribed to a PTVat 1-2cm from the lumpectomy cavity. A PTV was defined prospectively (pPTV) for most, 17% were done retrospectively (rPTV) for this analysis. The prescription dose (RxD) was 34 Gy/10 fractions BID for 87%, 39 Gy/10 fractions BID for the remaining. The mean planning target volume (PTV) and total breast volume were 142cc and 1075cc, respectively. On average, 92% of the PTV was covered by the RxD. Toxicity scored per Common Toxicity Criteria v.4, cosmesis by the Harvard Scale. Late toxicity/cosmesis was evaluated in those with >1year follow-up. Results: With 7.8 years median follow-up, three (4%) had an in-breast recurrence. All three were in the 'cautionary' or 'unsuitable' category of the ASTRO APBI consensus statement. Grade 2 acute toxicity was seen in 33% (most common pain and dermatitis) with no grade 3 events or moist desquamation noted. Long term, radiation-related grade 2 toxicity was 31%, mostly fibrosis. There was one grade 3 event (nipple/areola deformity) and one grade 4 event (angiosarcoma in treated breast). Cosmesis was excellent or good in 78%, fair 19%, and 3% poor. The mean V100 for pPTV and rPTV patients was 197cc and 288cc, giving conformality index of 1.54 and 2.74 respectively (p < 0.005). V150 and V200 were also smaller with a prospectively defined PTV (p < 0.01). More fair-poor cosmesis occurred in those without CT planning (p = 0.02). The volume of breast receiving 100%, 150%, and 200% of the prescription dose was associated with worse toxicity and cosmetic outcome (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This series of MCTAPBI demonstrates excellent local control and toxicity profile with long term follow-up. Careful 3DCT based planning for MCT APBI should be used to minimize toxicity and optimize cosmetic outcomes."
"Curry, H. A. and R. Jagsi",2013,Utilization of hypofractionation in an insured population.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): As the population ages, the prevalence of cancer relative to other diseases is expected to increase, as is the financial burden to patients and society as a whole. Hypofractionation (HF) represents a potential means to decrease economic and indirect burdens associated with the delivery of radiation therapy for many patients. To evaluate the clinical use of HF for patients with either stage I-IIA breast cancer or bone metastases in a working age, insured population, we assessed treatment plans submitted for preauthorization through eviti, Inc's web-based application. Materials/Methods: A proprietary web-based application enables oncology providers to obtain real time automated precertification for patients insured by payers across the United States that utilize the eviti platform. The platform evaluates treatment plans for consistency with evidence based medicine and compliance with specific payer policies and plan language. All preauthorization requests for radiation treatment submitted during an 18 month period from June 1, 2011-December 7, 2012 were evaluated for the use of HF. HF was defined as daily fraction size >2.5 Gy for breast and >3 Gy for bone metastases. We also evaluated the average cost for delivery of conventionally fractionated treatment vs HF treatment based on average reimbursement rates from three of eviti, Inc.'s largest payers. Results: A total of 3379 cases were submitted of which 279 were bone metastases and 370 were breast. We evaluated the overall rates and within any state with at least 10 submitted plans. Rates of utilization of HF in bone ranged from 0% in IN and MD to 40% in SD. Rates for HF in breast ranged from 0% in FL and OH to 20% in MO. Overall, only 31 of 279 or 11% (95% CI = 7-15%) of bone metastases plans and 32 of 370 or 9% (95% CI = 6-12%) of breast plans used HF. Delivery cost of a course of RT for bone metastases was $2,580 for 30 Gy in 10 fractions vs $258 for 8 Gy x 1 vs $1,235 for 20 Gy in 5 fractions. For breast treatment, cost for a typical course of 50 Gy in 25 fractions was $6,451 vs $4,128 for 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions. The cost difference was even greater if IMRT was utilized being $22,175 for 50 Gy in 25 fractions and $14,192 for 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions. Conclusions: In this unique dataset of radiation plan information from patients treated across the nation, we found low utilization of HF and marked regional variation. Despite data from randomized controlled trials showing comparable efficacy of hypofractionated regimens for the treatment of bone metastases and breast conservation for early stage invasive breast cancer, and endorsement by national consensus group guidelines, HF remains underutilized. Because HF is considerably less expensive to deliver, further investigation is necessary to ensure that limited health care resources are being appropriately utilized."
"Curry, H. A., et al.",2014,Utilization of hypofractionated regimens for treatment of breast cancer in an insured population before and after initiation of astro's “choosing wisely” campaign.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Clinical trials have established the efficacy of hypofractionated external beam regimens for treatment of appropriately selected patients with early stage breast cancer; however, its use in the United States has remained low. In an effort to increase physician and patient communication regarding RT options, ASTRO introduced its first 5 measures for the ABIM's “Choosing Wisely” Campaign in September, 2013. One measure specifically addresses the use of HF through consideration of shorter treatment schedules for women age 50 and older with early stage invasive breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT). To identify changes in prescribing patterns after “Choosing Wisely” we assessed treatment plans submitted for preauthorization through a web-based application and evaluated utilization rates of hypofractionation (HF) for treatment of patients with Stage I-IIA breast cancer over a 2.5 year period. Materials/Methods: A proprietary web-based application enables oncology providers to obtain real time automated precertification for patients insured by payers across the United States that utilize the platform. The platform evaluates treatment plans for consistency with evidencebased medicine and compliance with specific payer policies and plan language. All preauthorization requests for radiation treatment submitted during the period from June 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013, were evaluated for the use of HF. HF was defined as daily fraction size > 2.5 Gy. Patients eligible for HF breast treatment were defined as those receiving adjuvant RT for BCT for stages I-IIA breast cancer aged 50 and older. Rates of HF use for eligible breast patients were calculated for the entire study period, the period prior to 2013, quarterly during 2013, and for the entirety of 2013. Results: From June 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013, a total of 6504 RT plans were submitted of which 1317 were for breast treatment. 949 plans were for BCT of which 389 were eligible for HF. A total of 11.3% (44/389) of eligible patients were prescribed HF. Prior to 2013 the rate of HF for eligible patients was 9.6% (25/259). In 2013, 14.6% (19/130) of eligible breast patients were prescribed HF; quarterly rates of HF were 4.5% (1/ 22), 10.3% (3/29), 21.4% (9/42), and 16.2% (6/37) for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. Conclusions: Within this unique dataset of working aged insured patients in the United States, the rate of utilization of HF for BCT has increased. In particular, increased rates were most pronounced in Q3 and Q4 of 2013. This coincides with the announcement and dissemination of ASTRO's Choosing Wisely initiatives. Ongoing follow-up is needed to determine if increased use of HF for appropriately selected patients with receiving BCT for early stage breast cancer persists."
"Cuttino, L. W., et al.",2014,Long-term results from the contura multilumen balloon breast brachytherapy catheter phase 4 registry trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To describe the long-term outcomes from a completed, multi-institutional phase 4 registry trial using the Contura multilumen balloon (CMLB) breast brachytherapy catheter to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials Three hundred forty-two evaluable patients were enrolled by 23 institutions between January 2008 and February 2011. All patients received 34 Gy in 10 fractions, delivered twice daily. Rigorous target coverage and normal tissue dose constraints were observed. Results The median follow-up time was 36 months (range, 1-54 months). For the entire patient cohort of 342 patients, 10 patients experienced an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Eight of these IBTR were classified as true recurrences/marginal miss (TRMM), and 2 were elsewhere failures (EF). Local recurrence-free survival was 97.8% at 3 years. For the entire cohort, 88% of patients had good to excellent overall cosmesis. The overall incidence of infection was 8.5%. Symptomatic seroma was reported in only 4.4% of patients. A separate analysis was performed to determine whether improved outcomes would be observed for patients treated at high-volume centers with extensive brachytherapy experience. Three IBTR were observed in this cohort, only 1 of which was classified as a TRMM. Local recurrence-free survival at high-volume centers was 98.1% at 3 years. Overall cosmetic outcome and toxicity were superior in patients treated at high-volume centers. In these patients, 95% had good to excellent overall cosmesis. Infection was observed in only 2.9% of patients, and symptomatic seroma was reported in only 1.9%. Conclusion Use of the CMLB for APBI delivery is associated with acceptable long-term local control and toxicity. Local recurrence-free survival was 97.8% at 3 years. Significant (grade 3) toxicity was uncommon, and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. Treatment at high-volume centers was associated with decreased late toxicity."
"Cuttino, L. W., et al.",2008,Multi-Institutional Experience Using the MammoSite Radiation Therapy System in the Treatment of Early-Stage Breast Cancer: 2-Year Results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To present a retrospective multi-institutional experience of patients treated with the MammoSite radiation therapy system (RTS). Methods and Materials: Nine institutions participated in a pooled analysis of data evaluating the clinical experience of the MammoSite RTS for delivering accelerated partial breast irradiation. Between 2000 and 2004, 483 patients were treated with the MammoSite RTS to 34 Gy delivered in 10 fractions. Treatment parameters were analyzed to identify factors affecting outcome. Results: Median follow-up was 24 months (minimum of 1 year). Overall, infection was documented in 9% of patients, but the rate was only 4.8% if the catheter was placed after lumpectomy. Six patients (1.2%) experienced an in-breast failure; four failures occurred remote from the lumpectomy site (elsewhere failure). Cosmetic results were good/excellent in 91% of patients. Treatment parameters identified as significant on univariate analysis were tested in multivariate regression analysis. The closed-cavity placement technique significantly reduced the risk of infection (p = 0.0267). A skin spacing of <6 mm increased the risk of severe acute skin reaction (p = 0.0178) and telangiectasia (p = 0.0280). The use of prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of severe acute skin reaction (p < 0.0001). The use of multiple dwell positions reduced the risk of severe hyperpigmentation (p = 0.0278). Infection was associated with an increased risk of fair or poor overall cosmesis (p = 0.0009). Conclusions: In this series of patients, the MammoSite RTS seems to have acceptable toxicity rates and cosmetic outcomes, comparable to those with whole-breast radiotherapy. On the basis of these data, the closed-cavity placement technique, use of prophylactic antibiotics, use of multiple dwell positions, and a minimum skin spacing of 6 mm seem to improve patient outcome.

"Cutuli, B., et al.",2004,Breast-conserving therapy for stage I-II breast cancer in elderly women.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To assess breast-conserving therapy results in elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer (clinical Stage I-II). Methods and materials Between 1979 and 1998, 196 women (200 treated breasts) aged ≥70 years (median age, 72.5 years) were treated with breast-conserving therapy (lumpectomy or quadrantectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy). Pathologic axillary node involvement was found in 51 patients (28%). Two-thirds of patients received tamoxifen, and 16% received chemotherapy. Results At a median follow-up of 59 months, 3 patients (1.5%) had developed local recurrence and 20 (10.2%) distant metastases. The overall survival rate was 81% and 62% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The corresponding disease-specific survival rates were 92% and 88%. Axillary nodal involvement was the only statistically significant risk factor for the development of metastases (p = 0.0035). Arm mobility impairment and arm lymphedema each occurred in 5 patients. In another 5 patients, a thromboembolic event occurred during tamoxifen treatment. Conclusion Elderly women tolerate breast-conserving therapy, including radiotherapy, well and have excellent rates of locoregional control and disease-specific survival.  Inc."
"Dai, C., et al.",2016,Clinical outcomes following breast-conserving therapy versus mastectomy for T1-2N0 triple-negative breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): While randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent local control and survival between breast conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy (TM) for early-stage breast cancer, limited data are available based on biologic subtype such as those with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We therefore investigated our institutional outcomes for patients (pts) with pT1-2N0 TNBC. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive pT1-2N0 TNBC pts treated between 2003 and 2009 using an institutional tumor registry, which identified 211 pts. Pts received either lumpectomy followed by whole breast irradiation or TM without radiation. Pts with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, lumpectomy alone, post-mastectomy radiation, or a completion mastectomy following BCT for any reason were excluded. Analysis was performed for locoregional recurrence (LRR)-free, distant metastasis (DM)-free, and overall survival (OS), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was utilized. Additional sensitivity analyses excluding BRCA patients were conducted to determine the impact of BRCA1/2 positivity on outcome. Results: Median age in our cohort was 57 years (range 28-92). A majority of women were postmenopausal (70%) and received adjuvant chemotherapy (65%). One hundred forty seven women underwent BCT and 74 underwent TM, with an overall median follow-up time of 7.4 years. Patients receiving BCT were older at diagnosis (58 vs 55 years, P = 0.04), had smaller tumors (1.7 cm vs 2.2 cm, P<0.01), were more likely to be African American (27% vs 8%, P<0.01), or have positive margins requiring re-excision (12% vs 5%, P<0.01), and less likely to have an axillary lymph node dissection (2% vs 16%, P<0.01) or be BRCA positive (1 vs 12%, P<0.01). Five year LRR-free, DM-free, and overall survival rates for BCT and TM were 87% vs. 82% ( P = 0.56), 87% vs. 90% ( P = 0.60), and 90% vs. 90% ( P = 0.79), respectively. Adjusting for differences between treatment groups by stepwise regression, BCT was not found to be associated with increased rates of LRR (HR 1.1, CI 0.5-2.6). Excluding BRCA positive patients did not significantly change these findings. Conclusion: Our institutional experience demonstrates low long-term rates of LRR after BCT with no difference compared to mastectomy, suggesting that triple-negative subtype is not a contraindication for BCT in early stage breast cancer."
"Danish, H., et al.",2011,Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) as a prognostic marker for local control in T1-2 no breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy (BCS+RT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Interferons are essential in the cancer immunoediting process. Interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) is an interferon stimulated protein that is involved in the regulation of translation. It has been shown to mediate radiation and chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells in vitro. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic and clinical and pathologic significance of IFIT1 protein expression in patients with breast cancer treated with BCS+RT. Materials/Methods: A tissue microarray was constructed with specimens from 282 women with node negative, early stage (I/II) breast cancer who were treated with BCS+RT. Immunohistochemistry was used to stain for the IFIT1 protein. Cytoplasmic IFIT1 protein expression levels were correlated with clinical and pathologic factors, local relapse-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: IFIT1 positivity was found in 123 (49%) of cases. The median follow-up time was 7.3 years and the median age at diagnosis was 55 years. 80% of the patients had T1 disease, 88% were HER2neu negative and 20% had triple negative status. IFIT1 negativity was associated with ER+ status (p = 0.002), PR+ status (p = 0.02), non-triple negative status (p = 0.01), and HER2- status (p=0.006). In univariate analysis, IFIT1 positivity was only associated with improved LRFS (p=0.06), which did not hold significance in multivariate analysis. Using a log rank test, IFIT1 positivity was found to be associated with improved LRFS (94% vs 85%, p = 0.046) but not DFS or OS at 10 years. On subset analysis of the triple negative patients, IFIT1 positivity was found to correlate with improved LRFS (100% vs 53%, p = 0.004) and DFS in (87% vs 49%, p = 0.048) at 10 years using a log-rank test. Conclusions: In our cohort of node negative patients with early stage breast cancer treated with BCS+RT, elevated IFIT1 protein expression is associated with improved local relapse free survival. Additionally, our data suggest that IFIT1 expression may help risk stratify patients with triple negative breast cancer who may benefit from more aggressive therapy. Since there is limited data on IFIT1 in breast cancer, additional work is needed to ascertain its significance."
"Danoff, B. F., et al.",1983,The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on cosmesis and complications in patients with breast cancer treated by definitive irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"From 1978 to 1981, 46 patients received primary radiotherapy following excisional biopsy and axillary staging procedure for Stages I and II carcinoma of the breast. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 27 patients who received radiation and complete 12 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF or CMFP) and 19 patients who received radiation alone. All patients received radiation to the breast and regional nodes (4,600-5,000 rad) and a boost to the site of the primary tumor (1,500-2,000 rad). Median follow-up from completion of radiation was 26 months in the non-adjuvant and 24 months in the adjuvant group with a range of 12 to 49 months. Cosmesis was judged to be good to excellent in 89% (17/19) of the patients receiving radiation alone and 81% (22/27) of the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Fair to poor cosmesis in the adjuvant group was attributed primarily to increased fibrosis and reduction of breast size. The single complication for which there was an increased incidence in the adjuvant group was arm adema (22 vs. 0%). The incidence of arm edema was unrelated to T stage, type of axillary surgical procedure, number of positive nodes, addition of prednisone or sequencing of chemotherapy. Further efforts should be directed towards minimizing complications and maximizing cosmesis without sacrificing relapse-free survival in patients receiving primary radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer."
"Daveau, C., et al.",2011,Is radiotherapy an option for early breast cancers with complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine whether the exclusive use of radiotherapy (ERT) could be a treatment option after complete clinical response (cCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for early breast cancer (EBC). Methods and Materials: Between 1985 and 1999, 1,477 patients received NCT for EBC considered too large for primary conservative surgery. Of 165 patients with cCR, 65 patients were treated with breast surgery (with radiotherapy) and 100 patients were treated with ERT. Results: The two groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics, except for larger initial tumor sizes in the ERT group. There were no significant differences in overall, disease-free and metastasis-free survival rates. Five-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 91% and 77% in the no-surgery group and 82% and 79% in the surgery group, respectively (p = 0.9). However, a nonsignificant trend toward higher locoregional recurrence rates (LRR) was observed in the no-surgery group (31% vs. 17% at 10 years; p = 0.06). In patients with complete responses on mammography and/or ultrasound, LRR were not significantly different (p = 0.45, 10-year LRR: 21% in surgery vs. 26% in ERT). No significant differences were observed in terms of the rate of cutaneous, cardiac, or pulmonary toxicities. Conclusions: Surgery is a key component of locoregional treatment for breast cancers that achieved cCR to NCT.  Inc."
"De la Rochefordiere, A., et al.",1992,Are cosmetic results following conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early breast cancer dependent on technique?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"To assess the cosmetic results in relation to treatment technique, we retrospectively reviewed the results for 1159 Stage I-II breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy between 1970- 1985. All patients underwent gross excision followed by radiation therapy including an implant or electron beam boost. The total dose to the primary site was ≥ 60 Gy. Because of technical modifications introduced over time after 1981, the population was divided arbitrarily into two cohorts: 504 patients treated through 1981 and 655 treated between 1982-1985. Median follow-up times for surviving patients in the two cohorts were 107 months and 67 months, respectively. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated by the examining physician and scored as excellent, good, fair or poor. Excellent results at 5 years were scored in 59% of early cohort patients and 74% of the latter cohort (p = 0.002). Acceptable results (either good or excellent) were seen in 84% and 94%, respectively (p = 0.02). In the latter cohort, the likelihood of achieving an excellent result, but not an acceptable result, was significantly related to the volume of resected breast tissue and the use of chemotherapy. The number of fields (three-field technique, provided that fields are precisely matched, compared to tangents only) and boost type (implant vs electrons) did not influence the cosmetic outcome. We conclude that our current technique using breast RT to 45-46 Gy and a boost to the primary site of 16-18 Gy is associated with a high likelihood of acceptable cosmetic results and that this likelihood is not diminished by the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, a large breast resection, the use of a third field, or boost type."

Materials/Methods: The study includes 111 of 570 women treated in our Breast Unit since December 2010 with breast-conservative surgery. The inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 50 years, unicentric and unifocal tumors smaller than 3 cm diameter, negative surgical margins without an extensive intraductal component (EIC) or lympho-vascular invasion (LVI), pN0 or pN1 nodal status. Patients received a total dose of 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy fractions daily for 2 weeks. The clinical target volume (CTV) was the tumor bed and the close area defined by surgical markers. The primary end points of the study are local control and acute and late toxicity. Secondary end points are survival, cosmetic outcome, and patient compliance. All the patients were evaluated at three, six, and twelve months for the first year and every six months thereafter. At each visit, a cosmetic questionnaire exploring breast outline, shape, size, consistency, color, and scar was independently filled in by patient and physician. Results: Median tumor diameter was 10 mm (range: 3-30) and median age of patients 67 years (range: 51-88). Sixty-seven patients (60%) met the criteria of the “suitable” group of ASTRO-2009 consensus statement, while 44 patients (40%) did not because they lack one (31 pts) or two (13 pts) “suitable” factors as follows: age < 60 years (27 pts), invasive lobular histology (19 pts), pN1 (16 pts), pT2 (4 pts). With a median follow-up of 24 months (range: 4-38), in both groups no ipsilateral loco-regional recurrences have been reported, so far. One patient developed contralateral breast cancer 12 months after surgery. The treatment was well tolerated with acute or sub-acute toxicity according to RTOG scale grade 1 and grade 2, in 12 and in 2 patients respectively. Grade 1 late toxicity was recorded in 13 patients. The overall average mean dose to the whole heart was 0.6 Gy (range: 0.1-3.9 Gy). Treatment compliance was excellent (100%) with good cosmetic results both for patients and for physicians. Conclusions: The growing data obtained from phase 1-2 studies supports the use of APBI in early-stage breast cancer and new evidence guides the ongoing patient selection. In our preliminary experience, selected patients with one or two specific non-suitable tumor-related features according to ASTRO-2009 consensus statement may benefit from APBI with tomotherapy, and this technique can significantly decrease the mean dose to the whole heart, while providing the same local control."
"De Rose, F., et al.",2014,Phase 2 trial of hypofractionated breast irradiation with vmat-sib technique: Toxicity and early clinical assessment in 252 patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To report toxicity and early clinical outcomes of hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) approach with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) as adjuvant treatment after breast-conserving surgery. Materials/Methods: Patients presenting early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a phase 2 trial, approved by ethical committee. All patients underwent VMAT-SIB technique to irradiate the whole breast with concomitant boost irradiation of the tumor bed.Doses towhole breast and surgical bedwere 40.5 Gy and 48Gy, respectively, delivered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Acute skin toxicities were recorded during and after treatment according to RTOG scoring criteria, and late skin toxicities according to CTCAE v4.0. Cosmetic outcomes were assessed as excellent/good or fair/poor. Results: Between September 2010 and November 2012, 252 consecutive patients were enrolled. The median age of the population was 67 years (range, 36-88) and the median follow-up was 22 months (range, 12-36). The maximum acute skin toxicity by the end of treatment was: grade 1 in 35%, grade 2 in 9% and grade 3 in 1% (one case of bilateral breast irradiation). No grade 4 toxicities were observed. All grade 1 toxicities had resolved within 3 weeks. At the control after 180 days by the end of treatment, toxicities were recorded as follows: grade 1 in 23%, grade 1 in 2%. At 360 days: grade 1 in 13%, grade 2 in 1%. No grade 3 or greater was found. No significant differences in cosmetic scores on baseline assessment vs 3 months, 6 and 12 months after the treatment were observed: all patients were scored as excellent/good compared with baseline; no fair/poor judgment was recorded. No other toxicities or local failures were recorded during follow-up. Early evaluation of outcomes we have found 3 cases of recurrence, all of them outside the irradiated region: a distant metastasis, a contralateral breast relapse, an ipsilateral lymph node recurrence. Conclusions: The 3-week course of postoperative radiation using VMAT with SIB showed to be well tolerated in acute and early late setting and was associated with optimal local control. Long-term follow-up data are needed to assess late toxicity and clinical outcomes."
"Debald, M., et al.",2010,Increased Detection of Lymphatic Vessel Invasion by D2-40 (Podoplanin) in Early Breast Cancer: Possible Influence on Patient Selection for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Several international trials are currently investigating accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for patients with early-stage breast cancer. According to existing guidelines, patients with lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) do not qualify for APBI. D2-40 (podoplanin) significantly increases the frequency of LVI detection compared with conventional hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining in early-stage breast cancer. Our purpose was to retrospectively assess the hypothetical change in management from APBI to whole breast radiotherapy with the application of D2-40. Patients and Methods: Immunostaining with D2-40 was performed on 254 invasive breast tumors of 247 patients. The following criteria were used to determine the eligibility for APBI: invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of ≤3 cm, negative axillary node status (N0), and unifocal disease. Of the 247 patients, 74 with available information concerning LVI, as detected by D2-40 immunostaining and routine HE staining, formed our study population. Results: Using D2-40, our results demonstrated a significantly greater detection rate (p = .031) of LVI compared with routine HE staining. LVI was correctly identified by D2-40 (D2-40-positive LVI) in 10 (13.5%) of 74 tumors. On routine HE staining, 4 tumors (5.4%) were classified as HE-positive LVI. Doublestaining of these specimens with D2-40 unmasked false-positive LVI status in 2 (50%) of the 4 tumors. According to the current recommendations for APBI, immunostaining with D2-40 would have changed the clinical management from APBI to whole breast radiotherapy in 8 (10.8%) of 74 patients and from whole breast radiotherapy to APBI in 2 patients (2.7%). Conclusion: These data support the implementation of D2-40 immunostaining in the routine workup to determine a patient's eligibility for APBI.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"DeBiose, D. A., et al.",1997,The use of ultrasonography in the localization of the lumpectomy cavity for interstitial brachytherapy of the breast.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the value of breast ultrasonography (US) in defining the lumpectomy cavity for patients treated with interstitial brachytherapy. Methods and Materials: In March 1993, a protocol of low dose rate (LDR) interstitial brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality in selected patients with early breast cancer was initiated at William Beaumont Hospital. To date, 60 patients have been entered in this protocol, and 38 have undergone US assisted placement of interstitial brachytherapy needles. The lumpectomy cavity was outlined in all dimensions and corresponding skin marks were placed for reference at time of implantation. These US dimensions were compared to the physician's clinical estimate of the location of the lumpectomy cavity, the patient's presurgical mammogram, and the position of the surgical scar. In the intraoperative setting, the dimensions of the lumpectomy cavity were also obtained and the placement of the deep plane of interstitial needles was verified by US. Results: The full extent of the lumpectomy cavity was underestimated by clinical examination (physical exam, operative report, mammographic information and location of the surgical scar) in 33 of 38 patients (87%). The depth to the chest wall was also incorrectly estimated in 34 (90%) patients when compared to US examination. Intraoperatively, US was performed in nine patients and was useful in verifying the accurate placement of the deepest plane of interstitial brachytherapy needles. In 7 of 9 patients (75%), clinical placement of needles did not ensure adequate coverage of the posterior extent of the lumpectomy cavity as visualized by intraoperative US. Conclusions: In breast cancer patients considered for interstitial brachytherapy, US appears to be a more accurate means of identifying the full extent of the lumpectomy cavity when compared to clinical estimates. In addition, US allows real-time verification of needle placement in the intraoperative setting."
"Delaney, G. P., et al.",2016,"The Pattern of Use of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer in New South Wales, Australia, 2008 to 2012.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Increasing phase 3 evidence has been published about the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy, in comparison with standard fractionation, in early-stage, node-negative breast cancer. However, uptake of hypofractionation has not been universal. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypofractionation regimen variations in practice across public radiation oncology facilities in New South Wales (NSW). Methods and Materials Patients with early breast cancer registered in the NSW Clinical Cancer Registry who received radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer in a publicly funded radiation therapy department between 2008 and 2012 were identified. Data extracted and analyzed included dose and fractionation type, patient age at first fraction, address (for geocoding), year of diagnosis, year of treatment, laterality, and department of treatment. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with fractionation type. Results Of the 5880 patients fulfilling the study criteria, 3209 patients (55%) received standard fractionation and 2671 patients (45%) received hypofractionation. Overall, the use of hypofractionation increased from 37% in 2008 to 48% in 2012 (range, 7%-94% across departments). Treatment facility and the radiation oncologist prescribing the treatment were the strongest independent predictors of hypofractionation. Weaker associations were also found for age, tumor site laterality, year of treatment, and distance to facility. Conclusions Hypofractionated regimens of whole breast radiation therapy have been variably administered in the adjuvant setting in NSW despite the publication of long-term trial results and consensus guidelines. Some factors that predict the use of hypofractionation are not based on guideline recommendations, including lower rates of left-sided treatment and increasing distance from a treatment facility."
"Delouche, G., et al.",1987,Conservation treatment of early breast cancer: Long term results and complications.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Results of radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery were analyzed for 410 patients with clinical Stage I-II mammary carcinoma having a minimum and median follow-up time of 5 years and 11 years, respectively. Crude survival rates were 82.2% at 5 years, 62.5% at 10 years, and 45.4% at 15 years. Local-regional recurrence was observed in 9.7% of patients. Seventy-five percent of these recurrences could be controlled locally by further treatment. Both local recurrences and metastatic deaths were more frequent in patients in clinical Stage II and in patients 40 years of age or younger. The cosmetic result was judged good to excellent in 77% of patients, with unacceptable results in 6.7%. The majority of poor results were seen in patients receiving 60 Gy or more to the entire breast. Arm edema occurred in 25% of patients having had axillary dissection, and in 3.4% of patients without axillary surgery. Edema was confined mainly to patients having had axillary doses of 60 Gy or more, and was never disabling. This study demonstrates that excellent long-term results are obtainable with breast-conserving techniques in early breast cancer. Satisfactory cosmetic results and a very low complication rate can be expected if extensive axillary surgery is avoided in conjunction with axillary radiation, and if the radiation dose applied to large treatment volumes is restricted to 50 Gy."
"Demirci, S., et al.",2012,Breast conservation therapy: The influence of molecular subtype and margins.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate treatment results and prognostic factors, especially margin status and molecular subtype, in early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT). Methods and Materials: The records of 1,058 Stage I or II breast cancer patients treated with BCT (surgical excision plus radiotherapy) at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, from 1985-2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Conventional receptor analyses were used as surrogate markers for molecular subtype classification (luminal A, luminal B, Her2 positive, and basal like). Actuarial estimates of overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), failure-free survival, and locoregional control (LRC) were computed by use of Kaplan-Meier plots. We analyzed prognostic variables for significance using Cox proportional hazards univariate and multivariate analysis. The study was approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Results: The median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 18-89 years). Of the patients, 80% had T1 disease and 66% N0 disease pathologically. With a median follow-up of 9.8 years, an in-breast recurrence developed in 53 patients and 10 patients had nodal failure. For all patients, the 10-year CSS rate was 94%; LRC rate, 94%; and failure-free survival rate, 88%. Luminal A patients had a CSS rate of 95% and LRC rate of 99%. Basal-type patients appeared to do worse, with regard to both CSS rate (74%) and LRC rate (76%), but the numbers were small and the difference was not statistically significant. LRC rates of patients with negative margins (widely negative, close, and extent of margin not known) were virtually identical (93%, 96%, and 94%, respectively). Those with positive margins appeared to fare slightly worse based on LRC rate (88%), but again, the numbers were small and the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: BCT remains the treatment of choice for early-stage breast cancer patients irrespective of molecular subtype. Negative margins of excision are desirable, but the width of the negative margin does not influence outcome.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Den Hartogh, M. D., et al.",2013,Small treatment volumes and a low interobserver variability in preoperative MRI-guided target volume delineation for accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare treatment volumes and interobserver variability between preoperative MRI-guided target volume delineation and standard postoperative CT-guided target volume delineation for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Materials/Methods: In 14 T1-2N0 breast cancer patients, a contrastenhanced MRI in supine radiation therapy treatment position was acquired on a wide bore 1.5T MRI scanner before breast-conserving surgery. After surgery, a standard radiation therapy planning CT scan was made before start of the radiation therapy treatment. Preoperative tumors were delineated on contrast-enhanced MRI by four experienced breast radiation oncologists. Postoperative tumor beds were delineated on postoperative CT. Clinical Target Volumes (CTVs) were created by adding a 1.5 cm margin around the tumor or tumor bed, excluding skin and chest wall. Differences in volume, conformity index (CI) and distance between centers of mass (dCOM) between pre- and postoperative CTVs were analyzed by performing a related samples Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Median CTVs, CIs, and dCOMs are shown in the Table. Preoperative CTVs were significantly smaller (p=0.001), with significantly smaller dCOMs. A trend toward significance was observed for the CI, with a narrow range for preoperative tumor delineation. Conclusions: Preoperative MRI-guided target volume delineation resulted in smaller target volumes and a low interobserver variability compared to standard postoperative CT-guided delineation for APBI in early-stage breast cancer patients. A planning study for the implementation of preoperative MRI-guided APBI on an MR-linac system will be subject for further investigation and results are expected for presentation at the ASTRO 2013 annual meeting.

"Deore, S. M., et al.",1993,Influence of dose-rate and dose per fraction on clinical outcome of breast cancer treated by external beam irradiation plus iridium-192 implants: Analysis of 289 cases.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To study the influence of Iridium 192 implant dose-rate and dose per fraction of external irradiation on clinical outcome, the results in 289 patients with early breast cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Methods and Materials: From 1980 to 1990, 118 T1 and 171 T2 lesions of breast were treated definitively by radiotherapy, following conservative surgery. External irradiation dose of 45 Gy was delivered either with 2.5 Gy or 1.8 Gy per fraction to the entire target volume, plus boost to the primary tumor. Boost dose of 15 to 30 Gy was given to the primary tumor either with iridium- 192 implants or electrons. The implant dose-rate varied between 20 cGy/hr to 160 cGy/hr. Results: The minimum follow-up was of 12 months and maximum of 11 years (median: 56 months). Out of 273 tumors boosted with implants, the 270 patients were divided into five groups according to dose-rate as, groups 1 (20-29 cGy/hr, n = 17), group 2 (30-49 cGy/hr, n = 144), group 3 (50-69 cGy/hr, n = 69), group 4 (70-99 cGy/hr, n = 27) and group 5 (100-160 cGy/hr, n = 13). The local failure rate was significantly increased in the group of patients treated with implant dose-rate < 30 cGy/hr (p < 0.05). While the incidence of late normal tissue complications and poor cosmetic outcome was significantly higher in the group of patients treated with implant dose-rate > 100 cGy/hr (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The present analysis indicate that the implant dose-rate should be maintained between 30-70 cGy/hr to maximize local control and reduce the late normal tissue injury. Also the increase in dose per fraction of external irradiation while not influencing local control rate was crucial for incidence of late complications and cosmetic outcome."
"DeSouza-Lawrence, L., et al.",2011,Outcomes with external beam partial breast irradiation and concurrent chemotherapy (PBICC) compared to whole breast irradiation and sequential chemotherapy (WBISC) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with TNBC (ER/PR/HER2 neg.) have poorer rates of locoregional recurrence (LRR), diseasefree survival (DFS), and overall survival than their non-TNBC counterparts. MSKCC / Harvard recently reported a 5 yr. local recurrence rate of 33% in TN patients treated with PBI (Pashtan et. al. ASTRO 2010). We have completed 2 prospective trials of PBI and concurrent chemotherapy (PBICC) in women with early stage breast cancer, and the first trial has been reported (Zellars JCO 2009, PMID 19332718).We now report outcomes on a subset of TNBC patients treated with PBICC in single-arm studies with a contemporary institutional series of WBISC. Materials/Methods: Women with T1-2, N0-1 IBC with ≥ 2mm lumpectomy margins were offered PBICC on two early phase trials. TN patients on these protocols, and all those treated at our institution with WBISC, were evaluated for survival, DFS, LRR and in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). KM rates of local and distant recurrence and log-rank test of statistical significance are presented. One way ANOVA confirmed similarity between cohorts. Results: Between 2004 and 2009, 16 patients were treated with PBICC and 32 with WBISC. PBI consisted of 40.5 Gy in 15 daily fractions delivered to the lumpectomy bed plus margin (nodal irradiation prohibited) and concurrently with dose dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). In the WBISC group, the median dose (incl. boost) was 60.7 Gy (range 42.5 - 66), 5/32 had nodal irradiation and all received chemotherapy (AC in 28/32; cyclophosphamide/docetaxel in 4/32). Median follow-up is 38.4 mo (range 9.2 - 65.5) and 40.5 mo (range 5.6 - 77.8), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to T / N stage, median age, and menopausal status. No patients died. All 6 recurrences (1 nodal, 4 IBTR, 1 distant) were in the WBISC group. Median time to recurrence was 14.4 mo (range 0.8 - 38.6). DFS at 3 yrs / 5 yrs are 100% vs. 84.4% (p=0.10) and 100% vs. 81.3%. (p=0.07) in the PBICC and WBISC groups respectively. There is a trend towards decreased LRR (0% (0/16) vs. 15.6% (5/32), p = 0.12) and IBTR (0% (0/16) vs. 12.5% (4/32), p = 0.16), in the PBICC cohort compared to the WBISC cohort. There is no difference in DM rate, 0% (0/16) vs. 3.1% (1/32), p = 0.465. Conclusions: Our results differ from earlier reports of a high rate of LRR in TN patients treated with PBI. This may be due to our use of concurrent chemotherapy with PBI or to undefined factors in WBISC patients treated off protocol. In comparison to retrospectively reviewed TN patients, treated with WBISC, our data suggest improved DFS, LRR and IBTR with PBICC, and must be externally confirmed."
"Diao, K., et al.",2019,Effect of Surgeon Factors on Long-Term Patient-Reported Outcomes after Breast Conserving Therapy in Older Breast Cancer Survivors.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are an important quality measure in cancer care and the impact that various treatment choices have on PROs has been well-described. However, little is known about how treating physicians influence long-term PROs. Using early breast cancer as a model, we evaluated whether characteristics of the treating surgeon were associated with long-term PROs after breast conserving therapy. Materials/Methods: Potential study participants were selected from Medicare claims and included women age≥67 years diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and treated with lumpectomy + whole breast irradiation (WBI), lumpectomy + brachytherapy, or lumpectomy + endocrine therapy (N=15,843). A random sample of 330 patients per treatment group received mailed questionnaires evaluating baseline patient characteristics and PROs. The primary outcome measure was the CanSORT Satisfaction with Breast Cosmetic Outcome, a validated instrument scored on a 5-point Likert scale, with prior work suggesting a difference of 0.3 as clinically relevant. Secondary outcomes were BREAST-Q modules scored from 0-100, with a higher score indicating better outcome. Treating surgeons’ characteristics including age, sex, training location, specialization, and case volume were obtained via the AMA Physician Masterfile. Patient characteristics included age, race, income, education, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Multivariable linear regression with backward elimination identified treatment, patient, and surgeon factors associated with each outcome at p<0.1. Results: A total of 289 women responded (29% response rate). Of these, 37% received lumpectomy + WBI, 36% lumpectomy + brachytherapy, and 27% lumpectomy + endocrine therapy. The median age at diagnosis was 72 years and interval from diagnosis to survey response was approximately 6 years for all patients. Most treating surgeons were US-trained (85%), male (64%), and non-surgical oncologists (87%). In multivariable analysis, surgical oncology specialization was associated with improved outcomes. CanSORT cosmetic satisfaction mean score was 4.01 for patients treated by surgical oncologists vs. 3.53 for non-surgical oncologists (p=0.006). Similarly, BREAST-Q Physical Well-Being (92.0 vs. 83.0, p=0.006) and BREAST-Q Adverse Radiation Effects (95.3 vs. 88.9, p=0.004) mean scores favored patients treated by surgical oncologists. CCI was the only patient factor associated with CanSORT cosmetic satisfaction, with higher comorbidity associated with worse satisfaction. Conclusion: Specialized training in surgical oncology correlates with improved long-term patient-reported outcomes across multiple domains in older women undergoing breast conserving therapy. Such information may be useful to patients choosing their care teams and to quality improvement efforts."
"Dickler, A., et al.",2010,Initial results of a multi-center trial utilizing xoft axxent electronic brachytherapy to deliver intraoperative radiation therapy in the Treatment of Early-stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy (XB) is a form of balloon-based accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) that uses an electronic source to deliver kilovoltage radiation. The mobile nature of the XB controller, as well as, the limited shielding requirements make XB a logical modality to be utilized for intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). We report the initial results of the first trial to utilize XB to deliver IORT in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: The study population consists of 12 patients with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in a multi-center trial utilizing XB. Inclusion criteria included patients > 45 years of age, tumors < 3 cm, tumors with infiltrating ductal or DCIS histology, and patients with uninvolved lymph nodes by frozen section at the time of surgery. All patients had an ultrasound performed at the time of surgery to verify a minimum 1-cm of balloon-to-skin distance and evaluate the conformance of the balloon to the surrounding breast tissue. A pliable lead shield was placed over the chest wall before radiation treatment. Pre-loaded radiation plans for balloon inflation sizes of 40 cc, 50 cc, 60 cc, and 70 cc were utilized. The radiation prescription dose was 20 Gy delivered to the balloon surface. Results: The mean time to deliver the radiation was 22 minutes (range, 17-27 minutes). The total procedure time including lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, balloon catheter placement, XB controller calibration, radiation treatment, and closing was a mean time of 1 hour and 42 minutes (range, 1 hour 22 minutes - 2 hours 15 minutes). The mean balloon-to-skin distance by ultrasound for the 12 patients was 1.5 cm (range, 1.0 cm - 1.9 cm). All margins of excision were negative on final pathology. At a median follow-up of 15 months, overall cosmesis was rated as excellent in 10 of 12 patients and good in the remaining 2 patients. Three patients reported mild breast pain, 3 patients developed mild erythma of the skin, 1 patient developed grade 2 fibrosis, and 2 patients developed grade 1 fibrosis. To date, there have been no incidences of infection, fat necrosis, desquamation, or rib fracture. To date, no patient has developed a recurrence. Conclusions: IORT utilizing XB is feasible and can be accomplished in a total procedure time of approximately 2 hours. At short follow-up, XB IORT appears to be well tolerated."
"Dickler, A., et al.",2015,Five year results of a multicenter trial utilizing electronic brachytherapy to deliver intraoperative radiation therapy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We report the results of our study of Intra-Operative radiation therapy (IORT) utilizing kilo voltage radiation (eBx) as a form of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The mobile nature of the eBx controller, as well as the limited shielding requirements, makes eBx a logical modality to be utilized for IORT. Materials/Methods: The study population consisted of 68 patients with 69 early-stage breast cancers enrolled in a multi-center trial utilizing eBx. Inclusion criteria include patients equal to or greater than 45 years of age, tumors equal to or less than 3 cm, tumors with infiltrating ductal or DCIS histology, and patients with uninvolved lymph nodes by frozen section at the time of surgery. All patients had an ultrasound performed at the time of surgery to verify a recommended minimum 1-cm of balloon-to-skin distance and evaluate the conformance of the balloon to the surrounding breast tissue. A pliable lead shield was placed over the chest wall before radiation treatment. Pre-loaded radiation plans for balloon inflation sizes of 40cc, 50cc, 60cc, and 70 cc were utilized. The radiation prescription dose was 20 Gy delivered to the balloon surface. Results: The mean time to deliver the radiation was 13 minutes (range 7 - 30 minutes). The total procedure time including lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, balloon catheter placement, eBx controller calibration, radiation treatment, and closing was a mean time of 2 hour and 20 minutes (range 44 minutes - 6 hours 19 minutes). The mean balloon-to-skin distance by ultrasound for the 68 patients was 1.4 cm (range 0.7 cm - 2.8 cm). At last follow-up, overall cosmesis was rated as excellent in 88%, good in 9%, and fair in 3% of patients. Grade 1 or Grade 2 fibrosis, seroma, edema, and pain developed in 16%, 12%, 9%, and 9% of the patients respectively. There were 5 reported Grade 3 toxicities (2 infections, 1 telangiectasia, 1 nipple deformity, and 1 seroma). No Grade 4 or 5 toxicities were reported. There have been 4 total local recurrences (6%). Conclusion: IORT utilizing eBx is feasible and can be accomplished in a total procedure time of approximately 2 hours. At 5-years follow-up, eBx IORT appears to be well tolerated and have rates of local recurrence comparable to other forms of APBI. Further research on eBx and other methods of IORT is needed to establish long-term clinical efficacy and safety for patients with early-stage breast cancer."
"Dickler, A., et al.",2004,Treatment volume and dose optimization of MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Limited information has been reported on the dosimetry achieved with the MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator. We present our results regarding the volume of treatment and a comparison of a single prescription point, single dwell position optimization technique with a six prescription point, multiple dwell position method. Methods and materials Between October 14, 2002 and February 28, 2003, 21 patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated using the MammoSite device. The treatment was delivered in 10 fractions of 3.4 Gy/fraction, b.i.d., with a minimum of 6 hours between the daily fractions. CT of the lumpectomy cavity was obtained both with and without the inflated balloon. A planning target volume was constructed using a three-dimensional planning system. A three-dimensional expansion of the balloon surface was performed using the chest wall and skin as limiting structures. The volume of the inflated balloon was removed from this volume, and the volume of tissue treated in each patient was determined. A sequential expansion in 1-mm increments around the empty lumpectomy cavity was performed until the closest equivalent volume to the planning target volume was obtained. The treatment for the patients in this study was planned using both a single prescription point, single dwell position optimization technique and a six-prescription point, multiple dwell position technique. The single prescription point method has been described in a previous publication. The six-prescription point method used six points placed 1 cm from the balloon surface. Four points are in a plane transverse to the balloon axis perpendicular to the axis of the catheter, and two points are placed along the axis of the catheter. The prescription points along the catheter axis are used to compensate for the decreased dose coverage owing to anisotropy dose distribution of the source. The Nucletron HDR Plato Brachytherapy planning system was used to optimize the source positions and dwell times. Results The volume of breast tissue treated by the MammoSite device was equal to the volume encompassed by a mean 1.6-cm (SD, 0.1) margin around the empty lumpectomy cavity. Compared with the single prescription point optimization method, the six prescription point method provided better dose coverage, with a mean percentage of volume receiving 90% of the prescription dose of 97.2% (SD = 2.1) vs. 89.5% (SD = 4.6) for the single-point method. The mean percentage of volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose was 88.9% (SD = 3.3) for the six-point method vs. 77.6% (SD = 6.1) for the single-point method. However, compared with the single-point method, the six-point optimization method resulted in treatment that was less uniform, with a mean dose homogeneity index of 0.62 (SD = .07) vs. 0.66 (SD = .08) for the single-point method. Conclusion The volume of normal breast tissue treated by the MammoSite device is comparable to other methods of interstitial brachytherapy that treat a 1-2-cm margin of tissue around the excision cavity. The six-prescription point, multiple dwell position method improved dose coverage with a slight decrease in dose homogeneity. The six-point method offers greater reliability of dose coverage compared with the single-point method by providing an increased number of reference points.  Inc."
"Dilworth, J. T., et al.",2019,Use of Chemotherapy in Patients Receiving Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Irradiation: An Analysis within a State-Wide Quality Consortium.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Randomized clinical trials support the use of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (H-WBI) in select patients with early stage breast cancer following breast conserving surgery. Patients who received chemotherapy (CHT) are not well represented on these trials. This study investigates whether receiving CHT prior to WBI is associated with increased toxicity or worse cosmetic outcomes. Materials/Methods: We identified 7,014 women in a state-wide radiation oncology quality consortium database who received WBI with a surgical cavity boost between 11/2011 and 8/2018. Toxicity data were available for 6,870 patients. Significant acute toxicity was defined as patient-reported moderate/severe breast pain (≥4/10), physician-reported CTCAE ≥grade 2 breast pain, or the development of moist desquamation between 7 days prior to and 42 days following the completion of radiotherapy. We determined rates of physician-reported fair/poor cosmetic outcome per the Harvard criteria in 2,012 patients who had ≥1 year of follow-up. Rates of significant acute toxicity and fair/poor cosmetic outcome were compared among patients receiving conventionally fractionated treatment (C-WBI) or H-WBI. Multivariable modeling, adjusting for age, race, BMI, breast volume, separation along the central axis, comorbidity index, smoking status, radiation planning technique, breast D50, triple negative breast cancer, pTis disease, treatment at an academic institution, and receipt of CHT, were used to quantify the strength of association, given as an odds ratio [95%CI], between patient or treatment related factors and clinical endpoints. Results: C-WBI and H-WBI most commonly comprised 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions and 40-42.72 Gy in 15-16 fractions, respectively. A boost of 10-16 Gy in 5-8 fractions and 10 in 4 fractions was most common for C-WBI and H-WBI, respectively. CHT was administered prior to radiation therapy in 1266 (35%) of the 3,628 patients who received C-WBI and in 558 (17%) of the 3,242 patients who received H-WBI. Crude rates of significant acute toxicity were 43% and 40% for patients receiving CHT followed by C-WBI and C-WBI without CHT, respectively, and 29% and 27% for patients receiving CHT followed by H-WBI and H-WBI without CHT, respectively. CHT was not associated with worse acute toxicity for patients receiving C-WBI (OR=0.94 [0.79-1.12], p=0.50) or H-WBI (OR=0.79 [0.63-1.00], p=0.054). CHT was not associated with increased rates of fair/poor cosmetic outcomes at 1 year (OR=1.21 [0.82-1.78], p=0.33), independent of fractionation. Conclusion: In this large, multi-center cohort, rates of significant acute toxicity and fair/poor cosmetic outcomes were not worse in patients receiving chemotherapy prior to whole breast irradiation, compared to patients who did not receive chemotherapy, regardless of fraction size."
"Dinan, M. A., et al.",2015,Nationwide utilization of cardiac imaging in patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy with and without cardiotoxic chemotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Current guidelines are unclear as to the role of cardiac evaluation in patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy of the mediastinum. Utilization of cardiac imaging in patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy has not been previously examined in a nationally representative cancer patient population. Materials/Methods: Retrospective SEER-Medicare analysis of patients with incident cancer of the breast, lung, or lymphoma (stage I-II vs. III-IV) between 2000 and 2009. Patients with breast and lung cancer were analyzed separately with regards to curative vs. palliative treatment intent, respectively defined as non-metastatic stage with site-directed surgery and incident distant metastatic disease. We examined the association of claimsbased receipt of external beam radiation therapy with or without cardiotoxic chemotherapy (anthracycline, trastuzumab, or bevacizumab) and cardiac evaluation in the year following diagnosis. Results: A total of 225,104 patients met study criteria. Receipt of radiation therapy ranged from 12% in late stage lymphoma to 44% in patients with late stage lung cancer. Cardiotoxic chemotherapy ranged from 1% in lung cancer to 35% in lymphoma. Overall, 43% of all patients underwent cardiac evaluation in the year following their diagnosis with one of the following studies: echo (36%), exercise EKG (12%), MUGA (5%), nuclear imaging (<1%), or cardiac CT/MRI/PET (<1%). Rates of cardiac evaluation ranged from 35% in curative breast patients to 66% in patients with late stage lymphoma. Cardiac evaluation was slightly more frequent among patients undergoing radiation therapy vs. those not undergoing radiation therapy among patients with late stage breast (53% vs. 47%) and lymphoma (72% vs. 66%). Receipt of radiation therapy was not associated with increased rates of cardiac functional evaluation in patients with early stage breast cancer or lymphoma, and only a 2-6% higher absolute rate of evaluation in the remaining cohorts. In contrast, rates of cardiac evaluation were at least an absolute 10% higher in all settings among patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Conclusion: Cardiac evaluation appears more common in cancer populations more frequently treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy, but is only marginally associated with radiation therapy in late stage breast cancer and lymphoma. Receipt of thoracic radiation therapy in patients with early stage, curable disease, is not currently associated with increased rates of cardiac evaluation. Formal guidelines may be warranted to clarify the role of cardiac evaluation in patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy with curable cancer and the potential for long term treatment associated cardiotoxicity."
"Dinshaw, K. A., et al.",2005,Profile of prognostic factors in 1022 Indian women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The outcome of breast cancer treatment can vary in different geographic and ethnic groups. A multivariate analysis was performed for various prognostic factors in 1022 Indian women with pathologic Stage I-II breast cancer treated between 1980 and 2000 with standard breast-conserving therapy with or without systemic adjuvant therapy. Methods and Materials: At a mean follow-up of 53 months, the outcomes studied were local failure, locoregional failure, and distant failure, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: The median pathologic tumor size was 3 cm (range, 1-5 cm), and axillary lymph node metastasis was present in 39% of women. The actuarial 5- and 10-year OS and DFS rate was 87% and 77% and 76% and 68%, respectively. Lymphovascular emboli or invasion (LVI) was the strongest independent adverse factor for all failure and survival (local failure, hazard ratio 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-4.83; OS; hazard ratio, 2.01, 95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.99). Lymph node metastasis was also an independent adverse factor for local failure, locoregional failure, distant failure, DFS, and OS (hazard ratio, 1.55, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.30). Age ≤40 years increased the incidence of local recurrence, and patients with inner quadrant tumors had inferior DFS. The incidence of LVI was significantly greater in women with lymph node metastases than in node-negative women (p < 0.001) and in women with Grade 3 tumors than in those with Grade 1 or 2 tumors (p = 0.001). Conclusion: In Indian women, LVI was the strongest independent prognostic factor for OS, DFS, and local recurrence, irrespective of nodal status and systemic adjuvant treatment. Although LVI may not be a contraindication for BCT, as has been proposed by certain groups, it is necessary to define its role in prospective studies in determining local and systemic treatment.

"Diwanji, T., et al.",2017,Utilization of hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy in patients receiving chemotherapy (2004-2013): A national cancer database analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Mature results from 4 major hypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy (HF-WBRT) trials have demonstrated equivalence in select patients with early-stage breast cancer in comparison to conventionally fractionated WBRT (CF-WBRT). Because relatively little data were available on patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, consensus guidelines published in 2011 did not endorse the use of HF-WBRT in this population. Our goal is to evaluate trends in utilization of HF-WBRT in patients receiving chemotherapy. Purpose/Objective(s): We retrospectively analyzed data from 2004-2013 in the National Cancer Data Base on breast cancer patients treated with HF-WBRT who met the clinical criteria proposed by consensus guidelines (i.e., age >50 years, T1-2N0, and breast-conserving surgery), regardless of receipt of chemotherapy. We employed logistic regression to delineate and compare clinical and demographic factors associated with utilization of HF-WBRT and CF-WBRT. Results: A total of 56,836 women were treated with chemotherapy and WBRT (without regional nodal irradiation) from 2004-2013; 9.0% (n = 5,093) were treated with HF-WBRT. Utilization of HF-WBRT increased from 4.6% in 2004 to 18.2% in 2013 (odds ratio [OR] 1.21/year; P < 0.001). Among patients receiving chemotherapy, factors most dramatically associated with increased odds of receiving HF-WBRT on multivariate analysis were academic facilities (OR 2.07; P <.001), age > 80 (OR 2.58; P <.001), west region (OR 1.91; P <.001), and distance >50 miles from cancer reporting facility (OR 1.43; P <.001). Factors associated with decreased odds of receiving HF-WBRT included white race, income <$48,000, lack of private insurance, T2 vs. T1, and higher grade (all P< 0.02). Conclusion Despite the absence of consensus guideline recommendations, the use of HF-WBRT in patients receiving chemotherapy has increased 4-fold (absolute = 13.7%) over the last decade. Increased utilization of HF-WBRT should result in institutional reports verifying its safety and efficacy."
"Dorn, P. L., et al.",2010,Initial Report of UCCRC 3443: A prospective study on the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in determining candidacy for partial breast irradiation (PBI).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Treatment for early-stage breast cancer with PBI is currently under investigation in a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial, NSABP B-39. Retrospective data from our institution supports the use of MRI in addition to standard imaging (mammogram and ultrasound) in the pre-operative assessment of potential PBI candidates. MRI is not required and its use was not recorded for patients enrolled on NSABP B-39. We initiated a prospective study to evaluate the utility of MRI in determining candidacy for PBI. Materials/Methods: All women with newly diagnosed breast carcinoma at our institution undergo pre-operative bilateral breast MRI in addition to mammogram and/or ultrasound. Beginning in June of 2009, all imaging and surgical pathology have been reviewed in a multidisciplinary setting by radiologists, surgeons, pathologists and radiation oncologists in order to determine candidacy for PBI. In patients eligible for PBI, we prospectively documented whether MRI identified additional lesions in the same quadrant (multifocal), different quadrant (multicentric), or contralateral breast. Suspicious findings onMRIwere biopsied to confirm pathology. We prospectively recorded whether MRI findings prompted a change in the eligibility for PBI according to the entry criteria outlined in NSABP B-39. Prospectively collected data was verified by retrospective review of all patient records. Results: From June through December 2009, 190 cases were screened in a multidisciplinary conference. of 190 patients screened, 42 (22.1%) were deemed eligible for PBI based on mammogram, ultrasound, and pathology alone. The median age was 43 (range, 33-82). Amongst eligible patients, 31 patients (74%) had invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma, and 11 patients (26%) had ductal carcinoma in situ. MRI indentified additional disease in 4 patients (9.5%). The pathology of the additional lesions was infiltrating ductal carcinoma in all 4 patients. Multifocal disease was seen in 3 patients of 42 (7.1%), and contralateral disease was confirmed in 1 out of 42 (2.4%). The false-positive rate of MRI was 66.7%, and the positive predictive value was 33.3%. Conclusions: Early prospective results appear consistent with our previous retrospective finding that MRI identifies additional disease in a clinically significant percentage of patients. In this preliminary analysis, MRI indentified additional disease in 9.5% of patients otherwise eligible for PBI. Treatment of these patients with limited radiation fields would result in under-treatment of the tumor and could potentially compromise disease control. We will continue our prospective investigation in order to further elucidate the utility of MRI in potential PBI candidates."
"Dowlatshahi, M., et al.",2014,Favorable cosmesis and local control for single-lumen and multilumen applicators for accelerated partial breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The current standard for early-stage breast cancer is whole-breast irradiation. However, more patients are now being offered Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI). This study was undertaken to assess/report our institution's experience with this modality of treatment. We are comparing clinical outcomes in 55 [39 multi-lumen (ML) and 16 single-lumen (SL)] patients treated with APBI devices. Materials/Methods: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with early-stage (Tis, T1, or T2) breast cancer were treated between September 2006 and April 2012. 3 patients were excluded for having prior ipsilateral breast cancer. All patients were surgically treated with lumpectomies and APBI; chemotherapy and hormone therapy were administered when appropriate. Patients in both cohorts were treated with 3400 cGy in 10 fractions of 340 cGy in 5 business days. Statistical analysis was performed by use of the Log-Rank and Wilcoxon tests. Overall survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: All patients (n = 55) presented with a median age of 67 years. A majority of patients (56%) were of Asian descent, followed by White (27%), Hispanic (13%), and Black (4%). Due to regional ethnic distribution in the South Bay Area we observed an increased percentage of Asian patients in our study. Patients initially presented as: 21 Tis (38%), 30 T1 (55%), and 4 T2 (7%). Of the 55 patients, only 2 patients experienced a recurrence: 1 patient locally (1.8%) and 1 patient regionally (1.8%). The patient that recurred regionally recurred in the axilla (which was not treated). Overall, there was a not a statistically significant difference between ML and SL cohorts for local and regional control. In addition, no significant difference of reported cosmetic outcomes was observed in either cohort. 67% of patients reported excellent cosmetic outcome in the ML cohort and 69% reported an excellent cosmetic outcome in the SL cohort. At last follow-up all 55 patients had no evidence of disease. The median follow-up time was 35.3 months with an overall 5-year survival of 98%. Conclusion: APBI is a viable treatment option in early-stage breast cancer as the local control and cosmesis are favorable. At the outset of this study, we anticipated a difference in the SL versus the ML cohorts. There was no significant difference between the local control rate, regional control rate, and cosmesis of SL versus ML devices. However, due to our small cohort of SL devices, a further investigation is needed to validate the efficacy of SL devices versus ML devices."
"Doyle, J. J., et al.",2007,"Radiation Therapy, Cardiac Risk Factors, and Cardiac Toxicity in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Patients.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The benefits of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer may be counterbalanced by the risk of cardiac toxicity. We studied the cardiac effects of RT and the impact of pre-existing cardiac risk factors (CRFs) in a population-based sample of older patients with breast cancer. Methods and Materials: In the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results (SEER)-Medicare database of women ≥65 years diagnosed with Stages I to III breast cancer from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000, we used multivariable logistic regression to model the associations of demographic and clinical variables with postmastectomy and postlumpectomy RT. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we then modeled the association between treatment and myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia in the 10 or more years after diagnosis, taking the predictors of treatment into account. Results: Among 48,353 women with breast cancer; 19,897 (42%) were treated with lumpectomy and 26,534 (55%) with mastectomy; the remainder had unknown surgery type (3%). Receipt of RT was associated with later year of diagnosis, younger age, fewer comorbidities, nonrural residence, and chemotherapy. Postlumpectomy RT was also associated with white ethnicity and no prior history of heart disease (HD). The RT did not increase the risk of MI. Presence of MI was associated with age, African American ethnicity, advanced stage, nonrural residence, more than one comorbid condition, a hormone receptor-negative tumor, CRFs and HD. Among patients who received RT, tumor laterality was not associated with MI outcome. The effect of RT on the heart was not influenced by HD or CRFs. Conclusion: It appears unlikely that RT would increase the risk of MI in elderly women with breast cancer, regardless of type of surgery, tumor laterality, or history of CRFs or HD, for at least 10 years.

E., et al.",2016,First results of a phase 2 trial of once-weekly hypofractionated breast irradiation (WHBI) for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): We report the early outcome analysis of a prospective institutional phase 2 trial of WHBI for patients undergoing breastconserving surgery (BCS). Materials/Methods: Patients who underwent BCS for AJCC Stage 0, I, or II breast cancer with negative surgical margins were eligible to receive whole-breast radiation therapy to a dose of 30 Gy or 28.5 Gy in 5 weekly fractions with or without an additional boost. Eligibility criteria were the same as for NSABP B39/RTOG 0413, and there were no restrictions on age, breast size, tumor grade, receptor status or the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for otherwise eligible patients. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Patients were also evaluated for the development of distant metastatic disease (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) acute toxicity (CTCAE), cosmesis (Harvard Scale and BCTOS). Results: Between December 2010 and November 2015, 160 eligible patients underwent WHBI immediately following BCS. The median age was 60 years (range: 30-84 y) and the median follow-up was 3 years. A total of 2 patients developed IBTR (1.2%), one in conjunction with widespread metastatic disease. Four patients developed DM (2.5%) and the rates of DFS and OS were 97.5% and 96.9%, respectfully. The most common grade 1-2 acute toxicities were breast pain (26.7%), dermatitis (22.2%), and fatigue (13.7%). There were three grade 3 events (1.9%) which included fibrosis requiring surgery (2) and post treatment infection requiring hospitalization (1). The rate of Excellent/Good versus Fair/Poor cosmesis was 82.3% versus 17.7%. The rate of significant cosmetic change from baseline to last follow-up (dropping from Excellent/Good to Fair/Poor) was 11.6%. Conclusion: Early outcomes after WHBI are favorable and parallel those seen with daily, modestly-hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation. Our study has much broader entry criteria than all previous reports of WHBI, and will facilitate comparison to the results of NSABP B39/RTOG 0413. Continued follow-up will assess cosmetic stability and disease-specific outcomes observed here."

Methods and Materials: Patients who underwent BCS for American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0, I, or II breast cancer with negative surgical margins received whole-breast radiation therapy to 30 or 28.5 Gy in 5 weekly fractions with or without an additional boost. The eligibility criteria were the same as for NSABP (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project) B39/RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) 0413, and there were no restrictions on age, breast size, tumor grade, receptor status, or the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for otherwise eligible patients. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. Patients were also evaluated for acute toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0), cosmesis (Harvard Scale), development of distant metastatic disease, and overall survival. Results: Between January 2011 and October 2015, 158 eligible patients underwent WHBI immediately following BCS. The median age was 60 years (range, 30-84 years), and the median follow-up period was 3 years. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence developed in a total of 2 patients (1.3%), 1 in conjunction with widespread metastatic disease. Distant metastatic disease developed in 4 patients (2.5%), and the 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 97.5% and 96.2%, respectively. The most common grade 1 or 2 acute toxicities were breast pain, radiation dermatitis, and fatigue. There were 2 grade 3 events (1.3%): pain requiring narcotic analgesics (1) and posttreatment infection requiring hospitalization (1). The rate of excellent or good cosmesis versus fair or poor cosmesis was 82.3% versus 17.7%. The rate of significant cosmetic change from baseline to last follow-up (dropping from excellent or good to fair or poor) was 11.6%. Conclusions: Early outcomes after WHBI are favorable and parallel those seen with daily hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation. With broader entry criteria than all previous reports of WHBI, this study will facilitate comparison to the results of NSABP B39/RTOG 0413. With continued follow-up, future reports will assess cosmetic stability and disease-specific outcomes."
"Dragun, A. E., et al.",2010,Disparities in the application of adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and the impact on overall survival: A 10-year report from the kentucky cancer registry.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Definitive local therapy of early stage breast cancer includes adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). We analyzed factors that influence the receipt of radiotherapy therapy and resultant impact on outcome. Materials/Methods: We analyzed the rate of adjuvant radiotherapy for 11,914 women who underwent BCS as primary surgical treatment for stage 0, I, or II breast cancer between 1998 and 2007 using data from the Kentucky Cancer Registry. We assessed the probability of receiving radiotherapy using multivariate logistic regression, and impact on outcome using Cox survival analysis. Results: Overall, 66.2% of women received adjuvant radiotherapy for BCS over a 10-year period (annual rate range: 60.9%- 70.1%). On multivariate analysis, the rate of receiving radiotherapy was drastically lower for women older than 70 years (vs. younger) and rural Appalachia (vs. non-Appalachia) populations. The rate was modestly lower for African American (vs. white)women, those with in-situ (vs. invasive) disease, and uninsured (vs. insured) patients. Lack of radiotherapy was associated with an increased hazard ratio for death of 1.67 (95% CI: 1.508-1.851) on Cox survival analysis factoring age, stage, tumor size, tumor grade, hormone receptors, smoking, and insurance. The ten-year overall survival for patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy vs. BCS alone was 79.7% vs. 67.6% (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Despite widespread knowledge of the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy after BCS, the rate of under-treatment remains high, with significant disparities for elderly, rural, minority and uninsured women. Institution of multidisciplinary management strategies, including accelerated and hypofractionated radiation regimens, are needed to eliminate disparities and improve outcomes."
"Dreyfuss, A. D., et al.",2019,The Efficacy and Safety of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy with Concurrent anti-HER-2 Therapy Following Breast-conserving Therapy for Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: The administration of standard fractionation radiation therapy concurrently with systemic anti-HER-2 therapies has been reported, with acceptable efficacy and toxicity. However, comparable data for the administration of hypofractionated radiation therapy concurrently with systemic anti-HER-2 therapies is lacking. Objectives: The aim of this study is to report rates and severities of radiation-related toxicities and analyze disease-control outcomes in patients who have received hypofractionated whole breast radiation with concurrent trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including women with Stage I-III HER2 positive breast cancer who received hypofractionated radiotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania between 1/2005 and 5/2018 with concurrent trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab. Fractionation was 266 cGy daily to a total dose of 4,256 cGy with or without a sequential tumor bed boost. Results: 80 patients were included in the cohort with a median follow-up time of 21.44 months. There was one grade 3 acute toxicity (fatigue) and no grade 3 late toxicities. 91% and 25% of patients experienced grade 1–2 acute and late skin reactions, respectively. An excellent or good cosmetic outcome was reported by 74% and 95% of patients and physicians, respectively. No patients experienced tumor recurrences and the only death was due to a secondary cause. Conclusions: Hypofractionation radiotherapy whole breast radiation administered concurrently with anti-HER-2 therapies is both efficacious and has acceptable toxicity in early stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery. Continued follow-up is warranted to evaluate long-term outcomes."
"Dubey, A., et al.",1999,Concurrent CMF and radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: Results of a pilot study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The optimal sequencing of chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) for patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy is unresolved. Given the concerns arising from delaying either CT or RT, we conducted a pilot study of a concurrent CT-RT regimen in the hope that this would reduce side effects without decreasing efficacy.Methods and Materials: From 1992-1994, 112 patients with 0-3 positive nodes received 6 monthly cycles of classic oral chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (CMF). On day 15 of cycle 1, patients started tangential field RT (39.6 Gy in 22 fractions), followed by a 16 Gy boost in 8 fractions. Median follow-up time for surviving patients was 53 months.Results: Moist desquamation developed during or shortly after RT in 50% of patients, but only 5 patients required treatment breaks. Grade 4 neutropenia during RT occurred in 16 patients, but only 1 required hospitalization. One patient developed Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis. Ninety-three percent of patients received at least 85% of prescribed drug doses. Cosmetic scores of 51 evaluable patients approximately 2 years after the end of chemotherapy were 47% excellent, 43% good, and 10% fair. We have observed 4 local failures and 20 distant failures.Conclusions: This concurrent CT-RT scheme had acceptable toxicity and outcome. Further comparison of this approach allowing prompt initiation of both CT and RT to alternative sequences is warranted. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc."

B., et al.",1988,Tumorectomy and radiotherapy in early breast cancer: A report on 392 patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"This study includes 392 patients (231 Stage I and 161 Stage II) treated by tumorectomy followed by radiotherapy. The overall actuarial survival for all the patients is 86.5% at 5 years and 78% at 10 years. The 5-year NED survival is 70.2%. The survival rates are depending on the loco-regional extension: Stage I: 92% survival at 5 years and 84% at 10 years; Stage II: 82% survival at 5 years and 75% at 10 years. The percentage of local recurrences were 13% for all stages (10.6% for Stage I, 16% for Stage II), of lymph node recurrences: 1.5% for all stages, 1.3% for Stage I, 2% for Stage II, of distant metastases: 11.2% for all stages, 8% for Stage I and 16% for Stage II. The loco-regional control rates were analyzed according to the TNM classification and discussed and compared to several literature data. The breast preservation rates were at 5 years 85% for Stage I and 80.9% for Stage II. Cosmetic results are judged as good in 80% by doctors and in 90% by patients themselves with very low complication rates."
"Dudley, S. A., et al.",2015,Supraclavicular nodal involvement in breast cancer: How and when should we Adapt the RTOG atlas guidelines?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The role of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in breast cancer is evolving. In the current era of 3D treatment planning, it is important to accurately identify target volumes. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has outlined guidelines to define target nodal volumes for early stage breast cancer. The aim of this study was to identify whether breast cancer nodal involvement in the supraclavicular region correlated with the clinical tumor volume (CTV) as defined by the RTOG atlas. Materials/Methods: Thirty-one women with invasive breast carcinoma with supraclavicular nodal involvement were identified for analysis. For each patient, an individual CTV for the supraclavicular nodal region was contoured using the RTOG Breast Cancer Contouring Atlas as a guide. Involved nodes (gross tumor volume, GTV) were contoured independently using information from diagnostic imaging (including computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The supraclavicular CTV was compared to the GTVs for pathologic nodes, and each node was assigned a value for complete coverage, partial coverage, or complete discordance. In cases of partial coverage, the degree of coverage was expressed a percentage of the volume of the node which fell within the supraclavicular CTV. Results: Forty-nine supraclavicular lymph nodes were available for comparison to the supraclavicular CTV. 36.7% of the nodes were completely concordant, while 10.2% were completely discordant. For the remaining 53.1% of supraclavicular nodes which were partially covered, the degree of coverage ranged from 4.2% to 96.7%. In the cases where there was discordance, the nodes were located posteriorly and/or laterally to the supraclavicular CTV. Patients with supraclavicular nodal involvement were more likely to have adverse pathologic features, with 13 of 31 (42%) having estrogen/progesterone/Her2-neu negative cancer (triple negative) and 14 of 31 (45%) having estrogen receptor positive tumors with high Ki-67 or Her2-neu positivity (consistent with a luminal B-like tumor). Conclusion: Understanding patterns of supraclavicular nodal failure in breast cancer could help guide prophylactic nodal irradiation, and this study suggests that current RTOG atlas guidelines for the supraclavicular fossa may not extend posteriorly and laterally enough. However, given that broadening coverage may result in increased toxicity, identifying subsets of women at higher risk for failure is of particular importance."
"Dziemianowicz, M., et al.",2019,Analysis of the Financial Impact of the 2018 ASTRO Breast Dose-Fractionation Guidelines on Radiation Oncology Departmental Reimbursement.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The recent 2018 update to the 2011 ASTRO clinical practice guidelines for whole breast radiation therapy increased the number of patients with early stage breast cancer eligible for hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI). While these guidelines provide evidence-based rationale for treating patients with a shorter course of radiation therapy, the financial implications of such reductions in number of fractions in the fee-for-service environment are poorly understood. The goal of this study is to estimate the financial impact of this treatment paradigm shift on radiation oncology departmental reimbursement. Materials/Methods: A process map was created to model each phase of treatment, from consultation through first follow up, for conventionally fractionated WBI (CF-WBI, 50 Gy + 10 Gy boost, 30 fractions) and HF-WBI (42.6 Gy + 10 Gy boost, 20 fractions). Reimbursement for each step was obtained from the 2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) database. Review of patient characteristics among a previously published cohort of 1477 women treated with lumpectomy and post-operative WBI for T1-2 N0 breast cancer from 2011-2013 was used to determine the relative proportion of women with early stage disease eligible for HF-WBI under both 2011 and 2018 ASTRO guidelines. Under 2011 guidelines, 404 (44%) were eligible for HF-WBI. Under 2018 guidelines, all patients were eligible for hypofractionation. Based on this, reimbursement per breast case was calculated using a weighted average of reimbursement for HF-WBI and CF-WBI. Results: Reimbursement for CF-WBI and HF-WBI are approximately $12,406 and $9,162 per treatment course, respectively. Average departmental reimbursements per breast case under 2011 and 2018 guidelines, are therefore $10,978 and $9,162 respectively. This corresponds to a 16.5% decrease in reimbursement per case. Conclusion: Adherence to the new ASTRO guidelines for breast fractionation may result in a decrease in average reimbursement of up to 16% per case of WBI. While some practitioners may be hesitant to prescribe hypofractionated treatment due to dosimetric inhomogeneity or after particular chemotherapy regimens, the vast majority of patients previously ineligible under 2011 guidelines now receive consensus recommendations for hypofractionated treatment. Although hypofractionation will ultimately increase the value of radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer patients, the drop in reimbursement per case may impact departmental finances given the high proportion of early stage breast cancer patients seen in radiation oncology departments. An alternative payment model that better reflects the value provided by hypofractionation may ultimately bring financial incentives in line with the standard of care."
"Edwards-Bennett, S. M., et al.",2013,Is there justification for the utilization of IMRT in the treatment of early-stage right breast cancer?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) has been shown to reduce the heart dose in adjuvant radiation therapy for left breast cancer. However, the benefit of IMRT for right breast cancer has not been established and is therefore not routinely employed in clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to (1) compare dosimetric parameters in women with early stage right breast cancer undergoing whole breast radiation therapy using 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3DCRT) versus intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and (2) determine treatment planning and/or anatomical correlates for patients that may benefit from IMRT. Materials/Methods: An IMRT plan versus 3DCRT treatment plan comparison was performed for 20 consecutive female patients with early stage (T1-T2 N0M0) right breast cancer treated at our center from January 2012 to December 2012. The planned target volume (PTV) was contoured according to the RTOG atlas and guidelines. PTV was prescribed to 46.8-50.4 Gy in 26-28 fractions with PTV coverage goal of ≥95% receiving the prescription dose. The dosimetric parameters: percent total lung receiving 20 Gy (lung V20), maximum breast dose (Dmax), maximum skin dose (Dmax skin), as well as chest wall separation (CWS), and medial gantry angle (MGA) were determined for each paired treatment plan. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was performed to determine differences between IMRT and 3DCRT dosimetric parameters. Univariate analysis was used to identify planning or anatomic correlates with favorable dosimetric outcomes. Results: The total lung V20 Gy for IMRT (10.86 ± 2.81%) was significantly lower than for 3DCRT (12.92 ± 3.45%; p < 0.043). IMRT significantly reduced Dmax to 53.79 ± 2.17 Gy from 56.7 ± 2.24 Gy with 3DCRT (p 0.001). The 3DCRT yielded significantly higher Dmax skin (33.47 ± 3.21 Gy) than IMRT (24.16 ± 2.65 Gy; p < 0.0001). The mean CWS and MGA were 22.4 ± 2.6 cm and 126 ± 5.1°, respectively. There was a significant association between CWS and Dmax for 3DCRT (p < 0.026). However, there was no significant impact of CWS or MGA on either lung V20 or Dmax skin. Conclusions: Although IMRT is widely employed for left-sided breast cancers, there may be some utility for IMRT in the treatment of right breast cancer. Results reported herein demonstrate that the most significant positive impact of IMRT for right breast cancer is the reduction of Dmax and Dmax skin, with a more tempered advantage in the reduction of lung V20. Reduction of maximum breast and skin dose may harbor clinical relevance as it relates to acute skin toxicity, treatment interruptions as well as long-term fibrosis and adverse cosmetic outcomes. Chest wall separation may be a potential planning surrogate marker to determine which right-sided breast cancer patients may benefit from IMRT."
"Ellis, P., et al.",2009,"Sequential docetaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer (TACT): an open-label, phase III, randomised controlled trial.",The Lancet,"Background: Incorporation of a taxane as adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer offers potential for further improvement of anthracycline-based treatment. The UK TACT study (CRUK01/001) investigated whether sequential docetaxel after anthracycline chemotherapy would improve patient outcome compared with standard chemotherapy of similar duration. Methods: In this multicentre, open-label, phase III, randomised controlled trial, 4162 women (aged >18 years) with node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable early breast cancer were randomly assigned by computer-generated permuted block randomisation to receive FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 at 3-weekly intervals) for four cycles followed by docetaxel (100 mg/m2 at 3-weekly intervals) for four cycles (n=2073) or control (n=2089). For the control regimen, centres chose either FEC for eight cycles (n=1265) or epirubicin (100 mg/m2 at 3-weekly intervals) for four cycles followed by CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 at 4-weekly intervals) for four cycles (n=824). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT). This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN79718493. Findings: All randomised patients were included in the ITT population. With a median follow-up of 62 months, disease-free survival events were seen in 517 of 2073 patients in the experimental group compared with 539 of 2089 controls (hazard ratio [HR] 0·95, 95% CI 0·85-1·08; p=0·44). 75·6% (95% CI 73·7-77·5) of patients in the experimental group and 74·3% (72·3-76·2) of controls were alive and disease-free at 5 years. The proportion of patients who reported any acute grade 3 or 4 adverse event was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group (p<0·0001); the most frequent events were neutropenia (937 events vs 797 events), leucopenia (507 vs 362), and lethargy (456 vs 272). Interpretation: This study did not show any overall gain from the addition of docetaxel to standard anthracycline chemotherapy. Exploration of predictive biomarker-defined subgroups might have the potential to better target the use of taxane-based therapy.

"Enke, T., et al.",2014,Molecular radiation therapy in experimental model of advanced prostate cancer using internalizable monoclonal antibody.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): This study assessed the role of Her2-targeted radioimmunotherapy [RIT] in prostate cancer [PCa] using trastuzumab [TMab].We hypothesize that internalizable TMab radiolabeled with b- or high LETAuger electron-emitting radionuclide has potential to treat Her2 expressing castrate resistant prostate cancer [CRPC]. Therapeutic options for CRPC are limited. The recent introduction of 223Ra expanded the therapeutic options for this typically resistant phase of PCa and reignited interest in the radionuclide therapies. RIT is well established in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, however, RIT in solid tumors has had only limited success. In prostate cancer, the most developed RIT approach is with 177Lu-anti-PMSA. Her2 is overexpressed in some prostate cancers, especially in advanced phases, making it a promising RIT target. Her2 targeting antibody, TMAb, is already approved for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: In vitro studies were conducted in human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line PC-3. For external radiation therapy, cells were treated with a single dose of 10 Gy at 3 Gy/min, with (0.01 mg/mL) and without trastuzumab treatment. The studies were designed to measure the effect of TMab on the early and late G2 arrest as well as the reproductive integrity. The in vivo studies were conducted in Ncr nu/nu male mice bearing PC-3 xenografts. RIT was injected IV. The effect of RIT with TMab was compared to RIT with CC49, which targets extracellular antigen Tag-72. Results: In vitro, nonradioactive TMab alone had no effect on the growth, clonogenic survival or G2 arrest in PC-3 cells. In combination with ionizing radiation, TMab caused a significant late G2 arrest in PC-3 cells. In vivo studies indicated that 60 days after treatment, tumors treated with 131ITMab retained significantly less radioactivity compared to those treated with 131ICC49 or 131ICC49+131ITMab because unlike CC49, which remains predominantly in tumor extracellular space, 131ITMab is internalized and catabolized. Nonradioactive TMab alone neither accelerated nor reduced the growth of PC-3 xenografts. Tumor responses were similar in mice treated with 131ITMab and 131ICC49. However, the catabolic degradation of 131ITMab resulted in a faster systemic clearance of radioactivity. Conclusions: 131ITMab produces a therapeutic response virtually identical to this observed with 131ICC49, however, with a significantly lower absorbed radiation dose in normal tissues. 131ITMab-based RIT in PCa appears feasible and can be expected to inhibit tumor growth with minimal side effects."
"Epstein, A. H., et al.",1989,The predictors of distant relapse following conservative surgery and radiotherpay for early breast cancer are similar to those following mastectomy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Although previous studies have indicated that the predictors of local recurrence following conservative surgery (CS) and radiotherapy (RT) are not the same as those following mastectomy, it remains unclear whether the predictors of distant relapse differ by local treatment modality. Clinical and pathologic features predictive of distant relapse for patients treated with mastectomy have been well established and include lymph node involvement, histologic grade, and peritumoral lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI). To study the influence of these and other factors on the rate of distant relapse in patients treated with CS and RT, we have identified a group of 438 patients treated between 1968 and 1981 who met the following criteria: primary tumor size ≤ 5 cm, excision of the primary tumor, infiltrating ductal carcinoma as the most aggressive histologic subtype, histology evaluable for the presence of an extensive intraductal component, and a dose to the primary site ≥ 60 Gy. Estrogen receptor status was available in 58% of cases, 76% had an axillary dissection, and 23% were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 89 months, 107 patients (24%) developed a distant relapse. The 5-year actuarial freedom from distant relapse (FDR) was 80%. Stepdown Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified several factors associated with a significantly (p < 0.01) increased risk for distant relapse: positive lymph nodes, histologic grade, necrosis, and lymphatic vessel invasion. The magnitude of each effect was then examined with a lifetable calculation. Five-year freedom from distant relapse was 86% for the node-negative subgroup, 78% for patients with one of three positive nodes, and 45% for patients with four or more positive nodes. For histologic grades I, II, and III, 5-year freedom from distant relapse was 96%, 97%, and 75%, respectively. For necrosis scored as absent, scant, moderate, or marked, 5-year freedom from distant relapse was 90%, 78%, 77%, and 66%, respectively. For lymphatic vessel invasion scored as absent or present, 5-year freedom from distant relapse was 85% and 63%, respectively. We conclude that the clinico-pathologic predictors for distant relapse following conservative surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the same as those following mastectomy. This observation is consistent with the notion that distant relapse is caused by the presence of micrometastases at the time of initial presentation and is not greatly influenced by selection of local treatment."
"Erickson, D. L., et al.",2014,Axillary coverage during radiation therapy to the breast with tangents alone.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A recent large randomized trial showed no decrease in disease-free survival or overall survival in women with breast cancer found to have one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes in whom axillary lymph node dissection was omitted. These women were all treated with lumpectomy followed by tangential whole-breast irradiation. One theory for why the women did so well is that the simple tangents used to treat the breast also addressed the undissected axilla. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percent of the prescribed dose of radiation to the breast received by the axillary nodal regions with tangents alone in women with early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: The radiation therapy plans for 150 women treated sequentially from 5/2011 through 8/2012 for Stage 0, I or IIA breast cancer with simple tangents were analyzed retrospectively. Radiation plans for patients with early-stage breast cancer were selected to ensure the treating physicians were not specifically targeting the axilla with “high tangents.” Axillary levels I, II, and III were contoured on these plans per the RTOG Atlas guidelines and the plans were re-calculated to determine amount of coverage of each level of the axillary contents. Results: Analysis of the data shows that themean percent of axillary levels 1, 2, and 3 receiving >90% of the prescribed dose to the breast is 49% (standard deviation, or SD=25%), 3% (SD=10%), and 0.1% (SD=10%), respectively. The mean percent of axillary levels 1, 2, and 3 receiving >50% of the prescribed dose to the breast is 67% (SD=26%), 11% (SD=21%), and 1% (SD=5%), respectively. Themean max point dose received by axillary levels 1, 2, and 3 as expressed as a percent of the prescribed dose to the breast was 103% (SD = 4%), 42% (SD = 42%), and 16% (25%), respectively. Comparison of left vs right sided tumors and inner vs outer quadrant tumor showed no difference in amount of axillary coverage. Conclusions: In a low-risk breast cancer patient being treated with traditional tangents, coverage of the axilla is minimal with moderate coverage of level 1 but almost no coverage of levels II and III. Traditional tangents cannot be relied upon to adequately treat the axilla, as in the case of a positive sentinel node biopsy with no completion axillary nodal dissection."
"Facer, B., et al.",2019,Postoperative Seroma Formation Following Intraoperative Electronic Brachytherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Two prospective randomized trials, TARGIT-A and ELIOT have shown intraoperative radiation (IORT) to be safe and well-tolerated in low risk patients. There is, however, very little data on the rates of seroma formation in patients treated with IORT using electronic brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: From 12/9/2011 to 4/11/2018, a total of 100 patients (101 treatments) were treated at our institution with partial mastectomy and intraoperative electronic brachytherapy. A balloon applicator filled with saline (30-130 mL) was placed in the surgical bed. The skin was temporarily closed and an ultrasound was used to confirm that the balloon to skin distance was at least 10 mm. Electronic brachytherapy via IORT was utilized to deliver 20 Gy to the balloon surface in a single fraction prior to removal of the balloon and completion of surgery. Patients were followed every six months for at least five years. Results: Patients ranged in age from 41 to 83, with a median age of 66. Out of the 101 tumors treated, T-staging consisted of 29% Tis, 2% T1mi, 12% T1a, 24% T1b, 31% T1c and 3% T2. At a median follow up of 3.8 years, there have been two recurrences. Seroma formation was reported in 26 (26%) patients. Asymptomatic seromas were observed in 11 (11%) patients. Of the patients with symptomatic seromas, 11 (11%) required one or more aspirations. No patients required surgical excision of a seroma. Chi-squared analysis was performed for nominal variables (stage, histology, grade, proliferative rate, receptor status, margin status, tumor location) and binary logistic regressions for continuous variables (age, primary tumor size, and cavity size) with regards to risk of seroma formation. None of these reached statistical significance. Infection risk in patients with seroma was greater than in those without seroma (30.8% vs 12.0% respectively; p=0.04 using Fisher's exact test). Seroma formation was not associated with a risk of re-excision or readmission. Conclusion: IORT is a convenient and well-tolerated treatment option for the appropriately selected woman undergoing partial breast irradiation. Rates of seroma formation are similar to rates reported for multiple fraction catheter based systems."
"Falchook, A., et al.",2014,Adoption of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in early-stage breast cancer patients receiving hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated radiation in the United States.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Large randomized trials have demonstrated the non-inferiority of hypofractionated RT (HyRT) to the whole breast compared to conventional fractionation for many patients with early-stage breast cancer. Uptake of HyRT should represent cost-savings to the health care system, but these savings might be offset if providers are more likely to deliver HyRT using IMRT. We sought to evaluate the hypothesis that providers might preferentially use IMRT in HyRT courses, in an attempt to minimize the impact of higher doses per fraction to normal tissues. Therefore, we examined patterns of IMRT uptake in the US for breast cancer patients receiving HyRT and conventionally fractionated RT in recent years. Materials/Methods: A total of 21,211 women in the SEER-Medicare database with pTis-pT2 N0 M0 breast cancer who received lumpectomy followed by external beam radiation therapy from 2004-10 were included. Medicare claims were used to determine which patients received IMRT and the fractionation used: HyRT (13-24 treatments), conventional (25+ treatments). Bivariable and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate factors associated with receipt of IMRT. Results: On a background of increasing HyRT use over time, IMRT utilization increased, both in patients receiving HyRT and conventional RT (Table). By 2009-10, 22.7% of HyRT patients and 23.0% of conventional RT patients received IMRT. On multivariate analysis, later RT year (OR = 3.49 for 2009-10 compared to 2004, p < 0.001) and left sided tumor (OR = 1.45, p < 0.001) were associated with increased IMRT, with significant regional variation in use. Fractionation scheme (HyRT vs conventional) was not associated with IMRT (p=0.34), nor were age, race, comorbidity status, tumor grade, T stage, or regional education and income levels. Conclusions: IMRT utilization more than doubled from 9-10% in 2004 to almost one-fourth of women in 2009-10, with similar uptake in patients receiving HyRT and conventionally fractionated RT."
"Fan, J., et al.",2010,"Planning the breast boost: Dosimetric comparison of cyberknife, photon mini tangents, IMRT, and electron techniques.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Conventional breast conservation treatment consists of breast-conserving surgery and whole breast radiotherapy followed by a boost to the tumor bed. The purpose of this study is to compare CyberKnife to conventional photon mini tangents, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and electrons in terms of conformity and dose to normal tissues. Materials/Methods: Treatment plans were generated and compared using all four techniques for each of 15 patients with early stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery (6 right, 9 left). Surgical clips were used to define the clinical target volumes (CTV) of the excision cavities. Treatment plans were normalized to make the 95% isodose line covers 100% of the CTV. The prescription dose was 10 Gy in 2 fractions for CyberKnife and 10 Gy in 5 fractions for the other techniques. This dose/fractionation scheme was chosen to simplify the comparison. The Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm was used to ensure accuracy of dose calculation to the lung. The CTV conformity index (CI) and the dose volume histograms for the normal tissues for each technique were compared. Results: The mean CI with CyberKnife was 1.22, compared to 4.8, 2.1 and 2.4 for mini tangents, IMRT and electron techniques, respectively. The mean maximum lung dose was 6.0 Gy with CyberKnife, compared to 8.4 Gy with mini tangents, 7.9Gy with IMRT and 8.2 Gy with electrons. The V20 and V40 for the ipsilateral lung was 12.4% and 1.2% with CyberKnife, compared to 15.1% and 12.2% with mini tangents, 7.2% and 4.3% with IMRT and 9.6% and 5.2% with electrons. The skin and heart doses were also significantly decreased for deep tumor beds with CyberKnife Conclusions: The CyberKnife delivers a significantly more conformal dose to the lumpectomy cavity compared with other traditional boost techniques, and also allows for real time tracking using the surgical clips as fiducial markers. These advantages could result in reduced toxicity by reducing the dose to the surrounding breast tissue outside of the boost, skin, chest wall, lung or heart. Future research in needed to determine if CyberKnife radiosurgery boost using advanced target tracking techniques could improve local control by allowing radiation dose escalation in early stage breast cancer."
"Farrús, B., et al.",2004,Incidence of internal mammary node metastases after a sentinel lymph node technique in breast cancer and its implication in the radiotherapy plan.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To analyze the frequency in determining pathologically proven metastatic involvement of internal mammary nodes (IMN) after sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique in breast cancer and to evaluate the implications for radiotherapy (RT) management of patients. Methods and materials Two hundred and twenty-five patients who underwent lymphatic mapping for early breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation (80%) or mastectomy (20%) were evaluated. There were two phases in the study: the validation phase (105 patients, 52 T1, 53 T2 ≤ 4 cm), and the application phase (120 patients, 70 T1, 50 T2 ≤ 2.5 cm). In the validation, if a drainage pathway to the IMN was identified, no biopsy was performed in this phase. In the application, if the study showed metastases in the IMNs, biopsy was performed. When histologically proven IMN metastases were detected, RT was included on the IMN chain planned with a 3D treatment system using conformal techniques. At the beginning of the study the injection site was subdermal and subsequently, the injection site was changed to peritumoral and intratumoral to search for IMN. Results In 31 patients of 225 (14%) hot spots were observed in the internal mammary chain (11.5% and 17.2% in the validation and application phases, respectively). In the validation phase, in 11 cases (11.5%) IMN drainage was observed, and in the application phase, in 20 cases (17.2%). Sampling of the internal mammary basin based on lymphoscintigraphy results was successful in 69% of the cases (14 of 20) and revealed metastatic involvement in 14% (2 of 14). This represents incidence of only 1.7% (2 of 116) in early breast cancer patients with SLN study in the application phase. In both cases the axillary SLN was also positive. Both patients with metastatic involvement of the IMN area received RT on the IMN chain next to the remaining breast after conservative surgery. Conclusions We can conclude that 14% of the patients with intraoperative drainage into the IMN surgical examination of the lymph nodes had pathologically positive metastases. The percentage in pathologically proven metastatic involvement of IMN after the SLN technique in early breast cancer is low, but it is not negligible. Moreover, it is expected to increase since the international recommendations have established a 3-cm cutoff for practicing the SLN technique. Although the real value of IMN irradiation in early breast cancer is not known, including this chain in postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended unless pathologically proven IMNs have been produced by the SLN technique. To avoid overdosage or underdosage in the joint between the medial tangential and IMN fields, an individualized 3D dosimetry study is mandatory to enhance dose distribution and reduce the heart volume to lessen side effects.

"Fasola, C., et al.",2014,Local recurrence among patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with intraoperative radiation therapy: The effect of systemic therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Long term follow-up (f/u) of patients (pts) undergoing accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with single-fraction (SF) intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) following breast conserving surgery is limited. We report our institutional experience with SF IORT in early stage breast cancer with respect to local control and toxicity. Materials/Methods: Records were reviewed for 64 consecutive pts who received SF IORT from 2002 to 2014 at our institution. Of these, 47 pts were prospectively enrolled in an institutional IRB-approved phase 1-2 study between 2002 and 2008. Eligible pts were ≥40 years with stage 0, I or II breast cancer measuring ≥ 2.5 cm without nodal involvement and were all screened with breast MRI to exclude multifocal or multicentric disease. Eight of the 47 pts did not fully meet eligibility criteria and declined additional surgery or radiation. The remaining 17 pts were treated per protocol guidelines between 2009 and 2014. IORT was delivered using either a 200 kV orthovoltage source or electrons to 15-21 Gy prescribed to the 90% isodose line. Results: The median age at treatment was 61 years (range: 40-84 years). Median f/u time was 81 months (range 1 - 136 months). Two pts had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), one of whom was treated off protocol. A third patient had a nodal micrometastasis and developed an isolated axillary recurrence. All 3 patients had declined further surgery, radiation, and/or systemic therapy. Overall, 52 of 64 pts (81%) received adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of endocrine therapy (n = 49), chemotherapy (n = 5) and/or trastuzumab (n = 1). For pts who met original protocol guidelines, the IBTR rate was 1.6% at 6 years of f/u. On univariate analysis, the following factors emerged as significant predictors of IBTR: age <50 years (p < 0.001), pathologic nodal involvement (p < 0.001), and lack of any adjuvant systemic therapy (p=0.001). There were 2 cases of isolated distant relapses, which occurred in pts who had also declined adjuvant systemic therapy. Lack of systemic therapy was the only significant predictor of distant relapse (p = 0.01). All 64 pts tolerated IORT well with no evidence of grade III or higher toxicity. Conclusions: APBI using IORT is an inherently desirable option for breast conserving therapy. Our group has an IBTR rate of 1.6% at 6 years of f/u. Lack of systemic therapy emerged as a significant predictor for local, regional, and distant relapse. We conclude that adherence to appropriate clinical guidelines for patient selection and strongly advising adherence to recommendations for additional surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy are critical for successful use of APBI using SF IORT."
"Fawzy, R., et al.",2015,Comparative planning study of different tumor bed localization modalities after oncoplastic conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate modalities of tumor bed localization for target volume delineation (clinically, CT, ultrasound (US) in comparison to surgical clips-guided delineation) and the impact of the differences in delineated tumor bed volumes on dosimetric parameters. Materials/Methods: Twenty seven patients who underwent oncoplastic breast conservative surgery with surgical clips insertion (at least 3 clips) were included. CT & US imaging for tumor bed localization were done 3-4 weeks postoperatively in the same treatment position. Tumor bed was delineated four times; using surgical clips, clinical data, CT (seroma based) & US based. A plan was done for each tumor bed delineated. The four delineated volumes were compared regarding volumetric differences, geographical miss, and overlap index. Results: Tumor bed volumes were compared for the 4 modalities; it showed median values of 60.7 cm3 for clinical vs 60.8 cm3 for CT vs 49.3 cm3 for US in comparison to 59.7 cm3 for clips (P value=0.05). Median values for GMI (Geographical miss index: represented the tissue within the tumor bed at high risk of local recurrence which would not have been treated in the boost field if the experimental test was used), were 61.8% for clinical vs 45% for CT vs 62.4% for US, with a statistically significant difference (P value= 0.029). Median values for NTI (normal tissue index: was used to give an estimate of the area of normal tissue, which would have been included unnecessarily & is not at risk of local recurrence), were 59.5% for clinical vs 49.6% for CT vs 62.3% for US (P value=0.179). Overlap index (compared to clipsguided) value for clinical method was 0.36 vs 0.42 for CT vs 0.35 for US with a statistically significant difference (P value=0.041). In the anterior-posterior direction, the median shift was 0.72 cm for clinical vs -0.03 cm for CT vs -0.2 cm for US (P value=0.024). In the superiorinferior direction, the median shift was -0.07 cm for clinical vs -0.15 cm for CT vs -0.09 cm for US (P value=0.455). In the medio-lateral direction, the median shift was 0.4 cm for clinical vs -0.13 cm for CT vs 0.09 cm for US (P value=0.607). Conclusion: Significant differences in shifts & indices were detected between clinical, seroma or US boost localization when compared to surgical clips modality. Thus, in the setting of oncoplastic breast surgery, surgical clips should be routinely used for tumor bed localization. In view of the larger volumes of breast tissue excised & the extensive remodeling that are inherent to many oncoplastic procedures, the concept of tumor bed boost irradiation should be re- challenged."

Methods and Materials: Late toxicity according to the late effects of normal tissue-subjective, objective, management, and analytic (LENT-SOMA) criteria and cosmetic outcome (graded by physicians) were evaluated in 590 of 2943 women with early-stage breast cancer who were irradiated between 1983 and 1995 using the following fractionation schedules: group A, 1983-1987, 2.5 Gy 4x/wk to 60 Gy; group B, 1988-1993, 2.5 Gy 4x/wk to 55 Gy, group C, 1994-1995, 2.0 Gy 5x/wk to 55 Gy. Results: LENT-SOMA Grade 3-4 toxicity was observed as follows: group A (median follow-up 171 months; range 154-222 months), fibrosis 16% (7 of 45), telangiectasia 18% (8 of 45), and atrophy 4% (2 of 45); group B (median follow-up 113 months; range 78-164 months), pain 2% (8 of 345), fibrosis 10% (34 of 345), telangiectasia 10% (33 of 345), arm edema 1% (2 of 345), and atrophy 8% (27 of 345); and group C (median follow-up 75 months, range 51-96 months, n = 200), occurrence of Grade 3-4 late morbidity ≤2%. The cosmetic outcome was very good to acceptable in 78% (35 of 45) of patients in group A, 83% (286 of 345) in group B, and 94% (187 of 200) in group C. Conclusion: In our population, the long-term side effects after breast-conserving therapy were not rare, but were mainly asymptomatic. The LENT-SOMA breast module is a practical tool to assess radiation-induced long-term toxicity.  Science Inc."
"Feigenberg, S. J., et al.",2011,Preliminary results of a prospective feasibility study testing preoperative accelerated partial breast radiotherapy (APBI) using 3 dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We have previously reported the dosimetric benefits/advantages of preoperative APBI using 3 D CRT. Preoperative therapy significantly decreases the volume irradiated, which decreases the dose to all surrounding critical structures, and increases the number of patients eligible for APBI (1). This is the preliminary results of the first 10 patients on a prospective trial of pre-operative APBI. Materials/Methods: This is an IRB approved prospective trial testing the feasibility of preoperative APBI for patients with early stage breast cancer. Patients eligible for this trial had unifocal invasive carcinomas of the breast that were<3 cm. Axillary nodes were assessed clinically and by ultrasound, and they were required to be clinical N0. If a node was suspicious by ultrasound, a negative FNA was required to be eligible. Invasive lobular and in situ cancers were excluded. Treatment was very similar to those described in RTOG 03-19 (i.e. CTVand PTV expansions). The only difference was the tumor as seen on the CT simulation replaced the post-operative as described in RTOG 03-19. The dose delivered was 3.85 Gy per fraction administered 2 times a day with at least 6 hours between treatments to a total dose of 38.5 Gy. Four weeks later, a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Results: Between April 2010 and March 2011, 10 patients have consent for treatment on this study. The median age was 60.5 (range 53 to 83), the median tumor size was 0.9cm (range 0.45 cm to 1.3 cm), all with ER/PR positive disease. Nine of the 10 patient's treatment plans met dosimetric qualifications. One patient was deemed ineligible, due to the ratio of the PTV to the reference breast volume exceeding 25% and was not treated with radiation therapy prior to surgery. One patient with a tubular carcinoma had a complete pathologic response to treatment. One patient was found to have a positive sentinel lymph node after a negative pre-operative ultrasound and then underwent a completion axillary dissection with no further positive lymph nodes. One patient with diabetes had a persistent sinus following lumpectomy which has taken 6 months to heal. There were no grade 3, 4, or 5 complications secondary to radiation. Conclusions: Preoperative APBI using 3 D CRTappears feasible with no unexpected side effects.We plan to continue accrual for an additional 30 patients. Further refinements in immobilization and image guidance will allow further increases in eligibility by decreasing PTV margins."
"Feigenberg, S. J., et al.",2012,Preoperative accelerated partial breast radiation is associated with decreased CD8+ cells in patients with early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The immune response has long been known to play a critical role in tumor surveillance and control. It is thought that tumors develop by escaping immune detection and are found in greater prevalence in immunosuppressed populations. Conversely, a robust immune response, associated with cytotoxic immune cell populations, is associated with improved tumor locally and distantly. Several investigators have reported that local tumor irradiation elicits immunomodulatory effects and induces tumor-specific immune responses in pre-clinical models. We report the effect of pre-operative accelerated partial breast radiation (APBI) therapy on CD8+ T cell infiltration (CD8) on the first twelve patients treated on a prospective trial. Materials/Methods: This is an IRB approved trial testing the feasibility of preoperative APBI (38.5 Gy in 10 fractions over 5 days) for patients with early stage breast cancer using the same treatment guidelines (i.e. CTVand PTV expansions) as per NSABP B39. Patients eligible had unifocal invasive carcinomas of the breast < 3 cm. Axillary nodes were required to be N0. Lobular carcinoma and pure in situ cancers were excluded. Pre- and post-radiation tissue samples were evaluated morphologically and for any proliferation. A complete response (CR) was defined as no residual tumor identified or if the residual cells were unable to proliferate via Ki67. Additionally specimens were stained for CD8 cells and analyzed using the Aperio imaging capture and analysis system to systematically count the number of CD8 cells present. Statistical analysis included one-tailed student's t-test comparing pre- versus post-radiation CD8 counts. Linear regression model was used to determine a correlation based on CD8 counts, cellularity, and Ki67. Results: Three of the 12 patients had a CR either morphologically (2) or by the absence of residual proliferative ability (1). Of the 3 patients who had a complete response, the number of CD8 cells per mm2 counts increased in one patient (64 to 113.5) while dramatically dropped in 2 cases (197.1 to 17.3 and 411.7 to 6.9, respectively). For all patients, the CD8 cell counts dropped by a mean of 127 cells per mm2 (p value ≤ 0.02), the mean cellularity decreased from 20.4% to 6.9%, while the mean Ki-67 decreased from 16.8% to 8.8%. Linear regression showed no significant correlation between post treatment CD8 counts and treatment effectiveness as determined by change in cellularity (R2 = .008) or Ki-67 (R2 = .245). Conclusions: Preoperative APBI is associated with a small drop in CD8 cells. Based on small numbers, there is no clear relationship between pathologic response and the immune response generated by radiation therapy. We expect the use of ablative doses of radiation will have more of an impact on activating the immune system, complementing its direct tumor-killing effect."
"Feigenberg, S. J., et al.",2002,Angiosarcoma after breast-conserving therapy: Experience with hyperfractionated radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To report our promising results of hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) in conjunction with surgery for angiosarcoma occurring after breast-conserving therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Since 1997, 3 cases of angiosarcoma after breast-conserving therapy have been managed at the University of Florida. The histologic specimens in each case were reviewed and graded by one of us (J.D.R.). Results: Explosive growth of discolored skin lesions coincident with histologic evidence of angiosarcoma characterized all 3 cases but was preceded by a fairly indolent period (almost 2 years) of atypical vascular hyperplasia in 2 patients. All 3 patients were treated initially with radical surgery for the angiosarcoma, but extensive recurrences were noted within 1 to 2 months of surgery. Because of the extremely rapid growth noted before and after surgery, hyperfractionated RT was used. Two of the patients underwent planned resection after RT, and neither specimen demonstrated any evidence of high-grade angiosarcoma. All 3 patients were alive without any recurrent disease 22, 38, and 39 months after treatment. Conclusions: Hyperfractionated irradiation appears to be effective treatment for rapidly proliferating angiosarcoma. For previously untreated angiosarcoma, we now recommend hyperfractionated RT followed by surgery to enhance disease control and remove as much reirradiated tissue as possible.  Science Inc."
"Feigenberg, S. J., et al.",2012,Near 25% complete pathologic response following preoperative accelerated partial breast radiation therapy (APBI) using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Based on dosimetric benefits of preoperative APBI using 3DCRT, a prospective feasibility study was initiated. The preliminary pathologic results are reported. Materials/Methods: This is an IRB approved trial testing the feasibility of preoperative APBI for patients with early stage breast cancer using the same treatment guidelines as per NSABP B39. Patients eligible for this trial had uni-focal invasive carcinomas of the breast (excluding lobular carcinoma) that were < 3 cm. The patients had to be clinically N0 by axillary palpation and by ultrasound or MRI imaging. If a node was suspicious by imaging, this lymph node had to be proven negative with an ultrasound-guided biopsy. Patients were treated to 38.5 Gy delivered in 10 equal fractions with a minimum of 6 hours between fractions over the span of 5 days. Four weeks after completion of radiation therapy, a planned lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node assessment was performed. A complete pathologic response (pCR) was defined as no residual tumor on standard hematoxylin and eosin slides. Since breast cancer is a slow-growing tumor, residual tumor was evaluated carefully to assess response further by estimating tumor cellularity and cell proliferation. Tumor cellularity was measured as percentage of tumor area composed of malignant epithelial cells (as opposed to tumor stroma) on biopsy and post-radiation lumpectomy specimens. The proliferative ability of the treated tumor will be measured using the Ki-67 labeling index. A complete proliferative response (cPR) was defined as a decrease in Ki-67 to 0%. Results: Between April 2010 and February 2012, 21 patients signed informed consent and have been treated or are currently undergoing treatment with pre-operative APBI. Of the seventeen patients that have undergone surgery, 3 patients had a pCR and one additional pt had a cRR despite an initial Ki-67 of 43%. A fifth patient had a microscopic focus of < 0.2 mm from an initial clinical tumor size of 7 mm. To date, the first 12 were patients were reviewed by a single pathologist (PS) to evaluate cellularity and proliferation. The characteristics of the complete responders had a mean age of 72 (range, 55 to 81), a mean pre-treatment tumor size was 0.8cm (range, 0.45 cm to 1.4 cm), and were all ER+/PR+/Her 2 -. Two of the patients who had a cPR had a tubular carcinoma. The complete results on the 21 patients will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: Preliminary results of preoperative APBI using 3 D CRT demonstrate an impressive near 25% complete response. These surprising results open the door for dose escalation to improve the pCR rates."
"Feigenberg, S. J., et al.",2010,Development of a stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) system dedicated to the treatment of early stage breast cancer: the Gammapod.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has not been used for breast cancer primarily due to 2 reasons: 1) the lack of a suitable immobilization device since the breast is a pliable organ; and 2) the lack of an SBRT system that can concentrate a high radiation dose non-invasively. The purpose of this NIH grant funded project was to develop a dedicated SBRT system for early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Engineering and software design led to development of a breast specific immobilization device and a breast specific SBRT system. The immobilization cup consists of two layers with an air space in between; the inner layer conforms to the breast and the outer layer is rigid and air-tight. Both layers are joined by a flexible polyurethane flange that adheres to the chest wall. When a low negative pressure is applied between the two layers, the skin of the breast is pressed against the inner layer and is immobilized. The SBRT system uses 36 non-coplanar Co-60 sources which rotate around a focal point to produce 36 non-coplanar arcs. The dose distributions emulate that produced by a Gamma Knife. The system incorporates the use of a floating/dynamic table which together with the rotatable sources enabling differential dosing of target volumes (a.k.a. dose painting) similar to intensity modulated RT allowing higher ablative doses to the gross tumor and a lower sub clinical dose to treat microscopic tumor foci which extend beyond the gross tumor lesion. Results: The issues within the specific aims of the grant have been effectively solved and have led to patents for a breast specific immobilization device and a breast specific SBRT system - The Gammapod. The immobilization device has demonstrated improved accuracy and reproducibility allowing a reduction in the set up error to < 3 mm based on a prospective study involving 15 patients each having 2 CT simulations performed in the treatment position 10 to 60 minutes apart simulating the treatment planning scenario for the system. This precision allows a PTV margin reduction to 3 mm from the GTV. Treatment is performed in the prone position minimizing the effect of breathing motion. Dosimetric studies using Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that in tumors up to 5 cm in diameter within 5 mm from the chest wall, the lung/heart receive <10% of the maximum dose. Conclusions: A breast specific SBRT system which effectively addresses the two major obstacles for SBRT of early stage breast cancer has now been developed. This is the first SBRT device that enables dose painting. A multi-institutional Gammapod consortium is being developed for prospective studies."
"Fein, D. A., et al.",1996,Does the placement of surgical clips within the excision cavity influence local control for patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and irradiation?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: A number of authors have demonstrated the importance of using surgical clips to define the tumor bed in the treatment planning of early- stage breast cancer. The clips have been useful in delineating the borders of the tangential fields, especially for very medial and very lateral lesions as well as the boost volume. If surgical clips better define the tumor bed, then a reduction in true or marginal recurrences should be appreciated. We sought to compare the incidence of breast recurrence in women with and without surgical clips, controlling for other recognized prognostic factors. Methods and Materials: Between 1980 and 1992, 1364 women with clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer underwent excisional biopsy, axillary dissection, and definitive irradiation. Median follow-up was 60 months. Median age was 55 years. Seventy-one percent of patients were path NO, 22% had one to three nodes, and 7% had > four nodes. Sixty-one percent were ER positive and 49% PR positive. Margin status was negative in 62%, positive in 10%, close in 9%, and unknown in 19%. Fifty-seven percent of women underwent a reexcision. Adjuvant chemotherapy + tamoxifen was administered in 29%, and tamoxifen alone in 17%. Surgical clips were placed in the excision cavity in 556 patients, while the other 808 did not have clips placed. All patients had a boast to the tumor bed. Patients had their boost planned with CT scanning or stereo shift radiographs. No significant differences between the two groups were noted for median age, T stage, nodal status, race, ER/PR receptor status, region irradiated, or tumor location. Patients without clips had negative margins less often, a higher rate of unknown or positive margins and more often received no adjuvant therapy compared to patients with surgical clips. Results: Twenty-five and 27 patients with and without surgical clips, respectively, developed a true or marginal recurrence in the treated breast. The actuarial probability of a breast recurrence was 2% at 5 years and 5% at 10 years for patients without clips compared to 5 and 11%, respectively, for patients with clips (p = 0.01). Comparing the breast recurrence rates for patients with and without clips there was no significant difference for the following factors: chemotherapy, tamoxifen, negative, positive or close margins, reexcision, N1, and central or inner primary. Increased rates of breast recurrence were noted for patients with clips for the following variables: no adjuvant treatment (p < 0.001), unknown margins (p < 0.001), a single excision (p = 0.003), path NO (p = 0.001), and outer location (p = 0.02). A forward stepwise multivariate analysis for all 1364 patients was performed using the aforementioned variables as well as the presence or absence of surgical clips and the primary surgeon. The surgeon (p = 0.03) and no adjuvant treatment (p = 0.01) significantly influenced breast recurrence. For patients with surgical clips the 10 year isolated breast recurrence rate was 21% for a single surgeon vs. 6% in the remainder of the group (p = 0.01). For patients with clips, this surgeon had unknown margins in 48% of cases compared to 10% overall (p = 0.001). Excluding this surgeon from analysis the isolated breast recurrence for patients with clips was 6 vs. 5% for patients without clips (p = 0.18). Conclusions: Overall, there was a significant difference in the 10-year breast recurrence rate favoring women without clips despite more adverse prognostic factors. There was no difference in the breast recurrence rate for patients with or without surgical clips if careful attention to margin status was addressed. Failure to ink the surgical specimen resulting in unknown margins cannot be compensated for with the placement of surgical clips or treatment planning using CT to delineate the surgical bed."
"Ferraro, D. J. and I. Zoberi",2010,Nonrandomized Comparison of Multicatheter Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation vs. Whole Breast Radiation Therapy for Breast Conservation: Five Year Outcomes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adjuvant radiation therapy has been shown to increase local control when delivered as a part of breast conservation surgery for carcinoma in situ and early stage invasive breast cancer. In an effort to expedite radiation therapy and make it more appealing and accessible to women, accelerated partial breast techniques have been developed. Here we review our experience with partial breast irradiation via a multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy technique vs. a concurrent cohort of patients treated with whole breast radiation therapy by a single radiation oncologist. Materials/Methods: Patients treated in our clinic from 2003-2007 were reviewed. Selection criteria for this review included patients greater than 40 years of age at diagnosis with Tis-T2 disease, no nodal involvement, negative surgical margins, who underwent breast conservation surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients who received multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy (MC) are compared to a cohort of patients with the same selection criteria who received external beam irradiation (EB) to the whole breast. Results: A total of 192 patients were identified in the MC cohort and 188 patients in the EB cohort. The median age for the patients at diagnosis was 61.9 years with a range of 43.6-84.3 years in the MC group and 59.1 years with a range of 43.4-84.7 years in the EB group. Median follow-up for the MC cohort was 55 months with a range of 3-86 months and the median follow-up for the EB cohort was 57 months with a range of 4-98 months. In the EB cohort, tumor stage breaks down as follows: 27% Tis, 2% Tmic, 9% T1a, 21% T1b, 31% T1c, and 16% T2. In the MC cohort, tumor stage breaks down as follows: 19% Tis, 2% Tmic, 11% T1a, 35% T1b, 26% T1c, 7% T2. Invasive breast cancer subtyping was based on estrogen and progesterone receptor status as well as expression levels of human epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2/Neu). The breast cancer type for the two groups were as follows: 79% (MC) and 46% (EB) luminal A/B; 9% (MC) and 8% (EB) Her2; 9% (MC), and 15% (EB) basal type. Overall survival was 92% at for the MC cohort with 4 local failures. In comparison, the EB cohort had an overall survival of 94% with 7 local failures (nonsignificant). Conclusions: Our results suggest that accelerated partial breast irradiation via a multi-catheter technique provides similar local failure rates compared to standard whole breast irradiation at 5-years for selected patients. Excellent results with nearly five years of follow-up were seen despite the high fraction of younger patients and patients with DCIS."
"Finkel, M. A., et al.",2016,"Quality of life in women undergoing breast irradiation in a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating different tumor bed boost fractionations.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To identify differences in breast cancer patient-reported quality of life (QOL) between 2 radiation tumor bed boost dose regimens. Methods and Materials Four hundred patients with stage 0, I, or II breast cancer who underwent segmental mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and/or axillary node dissection were treated with either a daily or weekly boost. Patients were treated prone to 40.5 Gy/15 fractions to the whole breast, 5 days per week. Patients were randomized to a concomitant daily boost to the tumor bed of 0.5 Gy, or a weekly boost of 2 Gy on Friday. Patients completed 6 validated QOL survey instruments at baseline, last week of treatment (3 weeks), 45-60 days from the completion of radiation treatment, and at 2-year follow-up. Results There were no statistically significance differences in responses to the 6 QOL instruments between the daily and weekly radiation boost regimens, even after adjustment for important covariates. However, several changes in responses over time occurred in both arms, including worsening functional status, cosmetic status, and breast-specific pain at the end of treatment as compared with before and 45 to 60 days after the conclusion of treatment. Conclusions Whole-breast, prone intensity modulated radiation has similar outcomes in QOL measures whether given with a daily or weekly boost. This trial has generated the foundation for a current study of weekly versus daily radiation boost in women with early breast cancer in which 3-dimensional conformal radiation is allowed as a prospective stratification factor."
"Fischer-Valuck, B. W., et al.",2015,Accelerated partial-breast irradiation utilizing an on-board magnetic resonance image guided radiation therapy system: Evaluation of intrafraction motion of the lumpectomy cavity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate intra-fraction lumpectomy cavity motion in patients undergoing accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) utilizing an on-board magnetic resonance image-guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT) system with continuous MRI acquisition during treatment delivery. Materials/Methods: 10 patients with DCIS or early-stage breast cancer were treated with APBI using a Co-60 MR-IGRT system. PTV was defined as a 1 cm isotropic expansion around the lumpectomy cavity, with subtraction off the chest wall and 5 mm from the skin. Prescription dose to the PTV was 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions, twice daily. Continuous cine MR images were acquired in the sagittal plane with an acquisition rate of 4 frames/ second for the duration of each fraction. To assess intra-fraction cavity motion, 4 tracking points were placed on the edge of the lumpectomy cavity for each cine MR scan and analyzed for displacement in the anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior directions. To assess cavity movement from pre- to post-delivery of each fraction, a total of 100 preand post-fraction MR scans were manually registered based on the cavity, and resultant cavity translations in the longitudinal, vertical, and lateral planes were determined. Results: Onboard sagittal cine MR was visually monitored at the treatment machine and qualitative evaluation demonstrated no significant intrafraction motion of the lumpectomy cavity. In quantitative analysis of intrafraction motion, the mean movement of 4 tracking points placed at the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior cavity edges was 0.34 ± 0.07, 0.45 ± 0.12, 0.42 ± 0.09, and 0.28 ± 0.07 mm in the ant-post direction; and 0.44 ± 0.09, 0.62 ± 0.10, 0.46 ± 0.08, and 0.61 ± 0.10 mm in the supinf direction, respectively. Overall, the median motion of any tracking point in any direction was < 0.5 mm. Mean translation of the lumpectomy cavity from pre- to post-fraction scans in the longitudinal, vertical, and lateral planes was 0.44±0.32, 0.40±0.30 and 0.41±0.32 mm, respectively. Conclusion: Analysis of intra-fraction motion of the lumpectomy cavity utilizing continuous on-board cine MR images and pre- and post-fraction MR imaging confirm minimal cavity motion, on the order of < 0.5 mm, in patients undergoing APBI with MR-IGRT. Given the minimal cavity motion and excellent visualization with onboard MRI, we used a 0 mm margin for setup uncertainty and intra-fraction motion, which maintained the ability to target the cavity and adjacent breast tissue at risk, while treating a smaller resultant PTV. Resultant reductions in dose to the ipsilateral normal breast tissue and adjacent normal structures such as the heart and lungs may impact late effects and cosmesis. This work, to our knowledge, is the first to describe real-time movement of lumpectomy cavities on MRI during radiation therapy."
"Flynn, C. J., et al.",2010,A comparison of quality of life for early stage breast cancer examining whole breast IMRT versus accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare quality of life (QOL) of breast cancer patients receiving breast conserving therapy and radiotherapy via either whole breast intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), namely 3-D Conformal RT (3D-CRT), (MS) or Contura. Materials/Methods: From July 2003 to February 2010, 330 patients were enrolled in the study, IMRT (n = 252), 3D-CRT (28), MS (n = 43) and Contura (n = 7). QOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. The core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) measures physical, emotional, and social health issues relevant to cancer patients and is comprised of four categories: Global Health Status (GHS), Functional Scales, General Symptom Scales and Single Item Scores. High scores on functional scales and GHS represent high levels of functioning and QOL. High symptom scale/single item scores represent high level of symptomatology. QLQ-BR23 relates to personal issues in breast cancer patients and is scored identical to the functional scales. Statistical analyses performed for GHS, functional scales and symptom scores were stratified by treatment modalities (IMRT, 3D-CRT, MS and Contura). Time points were baseline (pretreatment), treatment completion, 3, 12 and 24 months post treatment. Results: At three months post treatment, IMRT had returned to their pretreatment/baseline mean score values in 14 out of 18 scales/scores. Within these scores, 10 out of 18 scales noted a statistically significant improvement. Namely, Global Heath Status, Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and Body Image. Nausea, appetite, and insomnia were statistically better for the symptom scales/scores. For APBI, this group returned to their baseline mean score values in 14 out of 18 scales/scores within three months. Within this group, 4 out of 18 scales/scores were statistically significant. These categories included a significant improvement in both Emotional Functioning and Financial Difficulties. From the symptom scores, there was a statistically significant improvement concerning breast symptoms. Conclusions: Both groups returned to their baseline mean score values at three months. However, the IMRT group surpassed their mean score values with higher percentages that were statistically significant. IMRT patients' had resolution in 14 out of the 18 scale scores and statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 18 scores within three months post treatment. They maintained these scores at 24 months post treatment. Treatment modality has a significant influence on the mean score values, impacting patients' functioning, symptomatology and overall QOL."
"Fodor, J., et al.",1999,Incidence and time of occurrence of regional recurrence in stage I-II breast cancer: Value of adjuvant irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The value of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) of the axilla and supraclavicular fossa is controversial in early-stage breast cancer. This retrospective study was undertaken to identify pathological risk factors that would predict which subsets of patients would benefit from regional nodal irradiation (RNI). Methods and Materials: A total of 1309 women with Stage I/II breast cancer underwent full axillary dissection and either mastectomy (n = 894) or breast-conserving surgery (n = 415). Of these, 712 patients received RN. The median axilla/supraclavicular fossa dose was 50 Gy. Results: The 10-year actuarial rate of axillary failure (AXF) was 0.5% in N0 and 2.8% in N1 patients (p = 0.0014). The number of retrieved nodes, ≤ 5 vs. > 5, also correlated with AXF; the respective rate was 4.3% v 1.2% (p = 0.0142). Neither the incidence of AXF nor the time to AXF was affected significantly by the use of RN but in N1 patients with retrieved nodes ≤ 5, the rate of AXF was 8.3% without RNI vs. 0% with RNI (p = 0.2340). The 10-year actuarial rate of supraclavicular failure (SCF) was 1.2% in N0 and 6.3% in N1 patients (p = 0.0000), SCF was also associated with the extent of nodal involvement (p = 0.0031). The incidence of SCF was not significantly affected by the use of RNI. However, when the results of N1bii and N1biv patients were evaluate as a single group, the effect of RNI was significant (p = 0.0358). The rates of SCF without RNI were high in patients with N1bii or N1biv stage: 10% and 37.5% and, with RNI, 3.2% and 18.2%, respectively. These finding were reinforced by the various combinations of T- and N1-stage. The mean time to SCF was 53.6 months in the irradiated and 24.9 months in the nonirradiated patients (p = 0.0007). Conclusions: After a complete axillary dissection, only N1 patients with retrieved nodes ≤ 5 may be considered for axillary RT. Elective supraclavicular RT is suggested for patients with N1bii or N1biv stage. Supraclavicular irradiation decreases the incidence and delays the appearance of SCF."
"Fogliata, A., et al.",2018,Critical Appraisal of the Risk of Secondary Cancer Induction From Breast Radiation Therapy With Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy Relative to 3D Conformal Therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the excess absolute risk (EAR) comparing volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy (CRT) in breast cancer radiation therapy treatment. Methods and Materials: Two VMAT arrangements (VMAT_tang and VMAT_full, i.e. partial arcs with and without a sector of 0 Monitor Unit, respectively) and a 3D CRT (field-in-field [FinF]) plan were calculated with an accurate dose calculation algorithm, Acuros, in 20 patients presenting with early-stage breast cancer. The dose prescription was 40.05 Gy in 15 fractions. The planning aim was to maximize the dose reduction in the lungs, contralateral breast, heart, and coronary artery. EAR was estimated using different models: linear, linear-exponential, plateau, and full model, which better uses a carcinogenesis model and epidemiologic data for carcinoma induction and which accounts for cell repopulation or repair during the radiation therapy dose fractionation. EAR was computed for contralateral structures—breast and lung—as well as the ipsilateral lung. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was computed to estimate the ipsilateral lung, heart, and skin toxicity, to balance with respect to second cancer induction. Results: The planning objectives were fulfilled with all the planning techniques. EAR for contralateral breast carcinoma induction, estimated with the most accurate model, was 1.7, 2.4, and 8.5 (per 10,000 patients per year) with FinF, VMAT_tang, and VMAT_full, respectively. For the contralateral lung, these figures were 1.5, 1.6, and 7.3 (per 10,000 patients per year), respectively. NTCP for all the analyzed endpoints was significantly higher with FinF relative to both VMAT settings, with VMAT_full presenting the lowest toxicity risk. Conclusions: VMAT, in particular with the VMAT_tang setting, could have the same risk of second cancer induction as 3D CRT delivered with the FinF setting for the contralateral organs while reducing acute and late NTCP for the ipsilateral organs. VMAT might be considered a safe technique for breast cancer treatment for those aspects."
"Formenti, S. C., et al.",2004,Prone accelerated partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery: Preliminary clinical results and dose-volume histogram analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To report the clinical and dose-volume histogram results of the first 47 patients accrued to a protocol of accelerated partial breast irradiation. Patients were treated in the prone position with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. Methods and materials Postmenopausal women with Stage T1N0 breast cancer were eligible only after they had first refused to undergo 6 weeks of standard radiotherapy. Planning CT in the prone position was performed on a dedicated table. The postoperative cavity was defined as the clinical target volume, with a 1.5-cm margin added to determine the planning target volume. A total dose of 30 Gy at 6 Gy/fraction was delivered in five fractions within 10 days. Results The median age of the patients was 67.5 years (range, 51-88 years). The median tumor diameter was 9 mm (range, 1.3-19 mm). In all patients, the prescribed dose encompassed the planning target volume. The mean volume of the ipsilateral breast receiving 100% of the prescription dose was 26% (range, 10-45%), and the mean volume contained within the 50% isodose surface was 47% (range, 23-75%). The lung and heart were spared by treating in the prone position. Acute toxicity was modest, limited mainly to Grade 1-2 erythema. With a median follow-up of 18 months, only Grade 1 late toxicity occurred, and no patient developed local recurrence. Conclusion These data suggest that this approach is well tolerated, with only mild acute side effects and sparing of the heart and lung.  Inc."
"Foster, L. M., et al.",2017,Toxicity profiles following whole breast irradiation plus sequential boost using hypofractionated or conventionally fractionated treatment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare toxicity and cosmesis in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with conventionally fractionated (C-WB) or hypofractionated (H-WB) whole breast irradiation with sequential boost. Purpose/Objective(s): We performed a matched-pair analysis to compare patients treated with C-WB or H-WB as part of BCT at a single institution from 2008-2016. 240 patients (120 pairs) were matched by age (+/-3 y), T-stage, chemotherapy (y/n), and endocrine therapy (y/n). Acute (≤6 mos post-WB) and chronic (>6 mos post-WB) toxicities were graded according to CTCAEv3.0. Cosmesis was evaluated using the Harvard cosmesis scale. Outcomes were analyzed using t-tests for continuous variables, χ2 for categorical variables, and Kaplan-Meier estimates. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results: Median whole breast dose was 42.56 Gy (39.9-41.72) in 2.66 Gy fractions for H-WB and 45 Gy (45-50.4) in 1.8-2 Gy fractions for C-WB. Median boost dose was 10.64 Gy (2.66-14) in 2.50-2.66 Gy fractions for H-WB and 16 Gy (6-22.5) in 2-2.5 Gy fractions for C-WB. Median follow up for all patients was 2.6y (0.1-28.1); 1.1 and 6.3y for H-WB and C-WB, respectively (p<0.001). Median age at diagnosis was 61 (44-88). 84% and 12% of patients received anti-hormone and chemotherapy, respectively. There were no differences in race, menopausal status, histology, or grade. The H-WB group had more close margins (< 2 mm; 32 v 4%, p<0.001). There were no differences in acute toxicity between H-WB and C-WB. Rates of grade 2/3 acute toxicity were <10% overall, with the exception of hyperpigmentation (15%). Rates of chronic toxicity (Table 1) were similar, with low rates of grade 2/3 toxicities (<12%). Cosmesis was good/excellent in 93% of patients, with no differences in the acute period. There were more H-WB patients with fair/poor chronic cosmesis (13 v 3%, p=0.026). Clinical outcomes were excellent at 3 years and similar between H-WB and C-WB. Conclusion: Patients had favorable toxicity profiles regardless of fractionation schedule used. In light of recently published data supporting favorable toxicity and cosmesis with hypofractionated regimens, we are evaluating specific dosimetric or patient related features that may contribute to the small difference in chronic cosmetic outcomes when comparing groups."
"Fourquet, A., et al.",1989,Prognostic factors of breast recurrence in the conservative management of early breast cancer: A 25-year follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Between 1960 and 1980, 518 patients with T1, T2, N0, N1a, invasive breast canceer were treated by limited surgery at Institut Curie with (183 patients) or without (335 patients) axillary node dissection, followed by radiation therapy to breast and nodes. Median follow-up was 8.6 years (1.3 to 25 years). Fifty-six breast recurrences occurred, including 49 breast recurrences alone, 3 simultaneous breast and node recurrences, and 4 simultaneous breast recurrences and metastasis. Five-year, 10-year, and 15-year actuarial risks of breast recurrences were 7 ± 1%, 11 ± 1.5%, and 18 ± 3%, respectively. Univariate analysis of 14 clinical and pathological prognostic factors revealed tht local control in breast was significantly impaired by young age, premenopausal status, inadequate gross surgical excision, extensive ductal in situ component, and endolymphatic extension. On multivariate analysis with a Cox regression model, the most important contributors to local breast control in order to importance were age (p < 10-4, relative risk = 2.44), adequacy of surgery (p = 0.003, relative risk = 2.78), and endolymphatic extension (p = 0.03, relative risk = 2.98). The 5-year actuarial survival rate following breast recurrence was 73%, and was significantly worse when breast recurrence occurred in the first 3 years after treatment: 44% versus 87%, respectively (p < 0.01). This study confirms the relationship between young age and low breast control rates, and demonstrates the importance of adequate initial surgical procedures. It emphasizes the adverse prognosis of early breast recurrences as compared to the relatively favorable outcome of late recurrences."
"Fowble, B., et al.",1996,"The impact of tamoxifen on breast recurrence, cosmesis, complications, and survival in estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the impact of tamoxifen on breast recurrence, cosmesis, complications, overall and cause-specific survival in women with Stage I-II breast cancer and estrogen receptor positive tumors undergoing conservative surgery and radiation. Methods and Materials: From 1982 to 1991, 491 women with estrogen receptor positive Stage I-II breast cancer underwent excisional biopsy, axillary dissection, and radiation. The median age of the patient population was 60 years with 21% < 50 years of age. The median follow-up was 5.3 years (range 0.1 to 12.8). Sixty-nine percent had T1 tumors and 83% had histologically negative axillary nodes. Reexcision was performed in 49% and the final margin of resection was negative in 64 %. One hundred fifty-four patients received tamoxifen and 337 patients received no adjuvant therapy. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups for age, race, clinical tumor size, histology, the use of reexcision, or median total dose to the primary. Patients who received tamoxifen were more often axillary node positive (44% tamoxifen vs. 5% no tamoxifen), and, therefore, a greater percentage received treatment to the breast and regional nodes. The tamoxifen patients less often had unknown margins of resection (9% tamoxifen vs. 22% no tamoxifen). The 5-year actuarial breast recurrence rate was 4% for the tamoxifen patients compared to 7% for patients not receiving tamoxifen (p = 0.21). Tamoxifen resulted in a modest decrease in the 5-year actuarial risk of a breast recurrence in axillary node-negative patients, in those with unknown or close margins of resection, and in those who underwent a single excision. Axillary node-positive patients had a clinically significant decrease in the 5-year actuarial breast recurrence rate (21 vs. 4%; p = 0.08). The 5-year actuarial rate of distant metastasis was not significantly decreased by the addition of adjuvant tamoxifen in all patients or pathologic node-negative patients. Pathologically node-positive patients had a significant decrease in distant metastasis (35 vs. 11%; p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in cause-specific survival for patients receiving tamoxifen when compared to observation (95% no tamoxifen vs. 89% tamoxifen; p = 0.24). Similar findings were noted for pathologically node-negative patients. However, axillary node-positive patients receiving tamoxifen had an improvement in 5-year actuarial cause-specific survival (90% tamoxifen vs. 70% no tamoxifen; p = 0.10). Cosmesis (physician assessment) was good to excellent in 85% of the tamoxifen patients compared to 88% of the patients who did not receive tamoxifen. Conclusion: The addition of tamoxifen to conservative surgery and radiation in women with Stage I-II breast cancer and estrogen receptor positive tumors resulted in a modest but not statistically significant decrease in the 5-year actuarial risk of a breast recurrence. Tamoxifen significantly decreased the 5-year actuarial risk of distant metastasis in axillary node-positive patients and there was a trend towards improvement in cause-specific survival that was not statistically significant. Tamoxifen did not decrease the 5-year actuarial rate of distant metastasis in axillary node negative, patients and in this group, there was no improvement in cause-specific survival. Tamoxifen did not have an adverse effect on cosmesis or complications."
"Fowble, B., et al.",2001,Second cancers after conservative surgery and radiation for stages I-II breast cancer: Identifying a subset of women at increased risk.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess the risk and patterns of second malignancy in a group of women treated with conservative surgery and radiation in a relatively contemporary manner for early-stage invasive breast cancer, and to identify a subgroup of these women at increased risk for a second cancer. Methods and Materials: From 1978 to 1994, 1,253 women with unilateral Stage I-II breast cancer underwent wide excision, axillary dissection, and radiation. The median follow-up was 8.9 years, with 446 patients followed for ≥10 years. The median age was 55 years. Sixty-eight percent had T1 tumors and 74% were axillary-node negative. Radiation was directed to the breast only in 78%. Adjuvant therapy consisted of chemotherapy in 19%, tamoxifen in 19%, and both in 8%. Factors analyzed for their association with the cumulative incidence of all second malignancies, contralateral breast cancer, and non-breast cancer malignancy were: age, menopausal status, race, family history, obesity, smoking, tumor size, location, histology, pathologic nodal status, region(s) treated with radiation, and the use and type of adjuvant therapy. Results: One hundred seventy-six women developed a second malignancy (87 contralateral breast cancers at a median interval of 5.8 years, and 98 non-breast cancer malignancies at a median interval of 7.2 years). Nine women had both a contralateral breast cancer and non-breast cancer second malignancy. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of a second malignancy were 5% and 16% for all cancers, 3% and 7% for contralateral breast cancer, 3% and 8%, for all second non-breast cancer malignancies, and 1% and 5%, respectively, for second non-breast cancer malignancies, excluding skin cancers. Patient age was a significant factor for contralateral breast cancer and non-breast cancer second malignancy. Young age was associated with an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer, while older age was associated with an increased the risk of a second non-breast cancer second malignancy. A positive family history increased the risk of contralateral breast cancer, but not non-breast cancer malignancies. The risk of a contralateral breast cancer increased as the number of affected relatives increased. Tamoxifen resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in contralateral breast cancer and an increase in non-breast cancer second malignancies. The 5-and 10-year cumulative incidences for leukemia and lung cancer were 0.08% and 0.2%, and 0.8% and 1%, respectively. There was no significant effect of chemotherapy or the regions treated with radiation on contralateral breast cancer or non-breast cancer second malignancy. The most common types of second non-breast cancer malignancies were skin cancers, followed by gynecologic malignancies (endometrial), and gastrointestinal malignancies (colorectal and pancreas). Conclusion: The 10-years cumulative incidence of a second cancer in this study was 16%. Young age and family history predicted for an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer, and older age predicted for an increased risk of non-breast cancer malignancy. The majority of patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation with or without adjuvant systemic therapy will not develop a second cancer. Long-term follow-up is important to document the risk and patterns of second cancer, and knowledge of this risk and the patterns will influence surveillance and prevention strategies.  Science Inc."
"Fowble, B., et al.",1998,The presence of proliferative breast disease with atypia does not significantly influence outcome in early-stage invasive breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the influence of the benign background breast- tissue change of atypical hyperplasia (AH) on outcome in patients with early- stage invasive breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and sixty women with Stage I-II breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation from 1982-1994 had pathologic assessment of their background adjacent benign breast tissue. The median follow-up was 5.6 years (range 0.1-15). The median age was 55 years (range 24-88). Of these, 23% had positive axillary nodes; 25% received adjuvant chemotherapy (CMF or CAF) with (9%) or without (17%) tamoxifen. Of the total, 24% received adjuvant tamoxifen alone. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 131 patients with atypical hyperplasia (ductal, 99 patients; lobular, 20 pts; and type not specified, 12 pts), and 329 patients with no proliferative changes or proliferative changes without atypia. Result: A statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for method of detection, primary tumor size, presence of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), pathologic nodal status, region(s) treated with radiation, and type of adjuvant therapy. Patients with atypical hyperplasia (AH) had smaller primary tumors (T1 80% vs. 70%) more often detected solely by mammography (51% vs. 36%) with negative axillary nodes (87% vs. 73%) and radiation treatment to the breast only (93 % vs. 78 %). LCIS was observed in 9% of the patients with AH and 3% of those without AH. Patients with AH more often received tamoxifen alone (32% vs. 21%), rather than chemotherapy (15% vs. 29%). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for race, age, menopausal status, family history, histology, histologic subtype DCIS when present, the presence or absence of an extensive intraductal component, final margin status, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, use of re-excision, or total radiation dose to the primary. The 5- and 10-year actuarial ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates were 2% and 12% for patients with AH and 4% and 8% for those without AH (p = 0.44). Younger women or those with a positive family history of breast cancer with AH did not have an increased rate of breast failure when compared to similar patients without AH. There were no significant differences in the 5-and 10- year actuarial rates of distant metastases (AH 5- and 10-year 7% and 7%, no AH 5- and 10-year 8% and 16%, p = 0.31), regional node recurrence (AH 1% and 1%, no AH 1% and 1%,p = 0.71), contralateral breast cancer (AH 3% and 3%, no AH 3% and 8%, p = 0.71), overall survival (AH 95% and 86%, no AH 95% and 89%, p = 0.79), or cause-specific survival (AH 98% and 95%, no AH 96% and 91%,p = 0.27). Subset analysis for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, distant metastases, overall, and cause-specific survival for T1 vs. T2 tumors and path node-negative vs. path node-positive patients revealed no significant differences between the 2 groups. Conclusion: AH was not associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence or contralateral breast cancer in this study of patients with invasive breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation. Therefore, the presence of proliferative changes with atypia in background benign breast tissue should not be a contraindication to breast-conservation therapy."
"Fowble, B., et al.",1989,"Frequency, sites of relapse, and outcome of regional node failures following conservative surgery and radiation for early breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Between 1970 and 1986, 990 patients underwent excisional biopsy and radiation for clinical Stage I or II breast cancer. A limited axillary dissection (levels I and II) was performed in 914 of these patients. The median follow-up was 40 months from the initiation of radiation. Thirty-one patients developed a regional node failure as their first site of recurrence either with (12 patients) or without (19 patients) simultaneous distant metastases. The median interval to recurrence was 27 months (range 4-59). The 5-year actuarial rate for an isolated regional node recurrence (without simultaneous distant metastases) was 3%. The most common site for a regional node failure was the axilla (17 patients) followed by the supraclavicular nodes (13 patients). Salvage therapy was effective for an axillary ± breast failure with 10/14 patients alive with no evidence of disease. Prognosis was related to the site of recurrence as well as the presence of distant metastases. The 5-year actuarial survival from initial treatment for all patients with a regional node failure was 63% with a 3-year actuarial survival of 57% from diagnosis of recurrence. Regional node failure was related to the number of axillary nodes removed at the time of dissection and patient age."
"Fowble, B., et al.",1992,Breast recurrence and survival related to primary tumor location in patients undergoing conservative surgery and radiation for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Between 1977 and 1986, 886 pts with Stage I and II breast cancer underwent excisional biopsy, axillary dissection and radiation. Median follow-up was 5 years (range 2 months-13 years). The patients were divided into four groups according to the primary tumor location: 1) outer (495 patients), 2) inner (202 patients), 3) central (119 patients), and 4) subareolar (70 patients). Subareolar tumors were defined as those immediately beneath the nipple- areolar complex or within 2 cm of the areolar margin. The comparability of the groups was assed in terms of clinical T stage, patient age, histology, final pathologic margin status, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, pathologic nodal status, and use of adjuvant chemotherapy. There were no significant differences among the four groups in the distribution of these factors except for the pathologic nodal status (outer 38% positive nodes, inner 24%, central 23%, subareolar 31%) p = .0004. There were no significant differences in 5 year actuarial overall survival (91% vs 86% vs 92% vs 91%, p = .34), relapse-free (75% vs 74% vs 80% vs 79%, p = .77), or NED survival (82% vs 78% vs 87% vs 84%, p = .29) for the four groups. A separate analysis for pathologic node negative and node positive patients revealed similar findings. For node-negative patients, the 5 year actuarial overall survival was 93% vs 88% vs 94% vs 91% (p = .20), the relapse-free survival was 78% vs 76% vs 82% vs 79% (p = .49), and the NED survival was 86% vs 81% vs 88% vs 86% (p = .46). For node-positive patients, the 5 year actuarial overall survival was 87% vs 82% vs 84% vs 90% (p = .59), relapse-free survival was 69% vs 66% vs 77% vs 80% (p = .78), and NED survival was 75% vs 68% vs 85% vs 80% (p = .66). Patterns of first failure were also not significantly different among the four groups: local only first failure (7% vs 4% vs 5% vs 8%, p = .49), any local first failure, i.e., ±simultaneous distant metastases (8% vs 5% vs 5% vs 9%, p = .61), regional only (2% vs 1% vs 1% vs 0%, p = .65), any regional (4% vs 3% vs 3% vs 3%), or distant metastases (11% vs 17% vs 9% vs 10%, p = .16). A separate analysis of node negative and node positive patients revealed similar findings. The present analysis demonstrates no significant correlation between primary tumor location and patterns of first failure, overall survival, relapse-free, or no evidence of disease (NED) survival in 886 pts with Stage I and II breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation. Subareolar tumor location was not associated with an increased risk of breast recurrence in appropriately selected patients."
"Fowble, B. L., et al.",1994,The influence of young age on outcome in early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess the impact of young age on outcome in women with early stage breast cancer undergoing conservative surgery and radiation. Methods and Materials: Between 1981 and 1991, 980 patients with Stage I and II breast cancer underwent excisional biopsy, axillary dissection, and radiation. The median follow-up was 4.6 years, with a range of 1 month to 11 years. The patients were divided into three groups, based on age at the time of diagnosis: (a) age ≤ 35 years-64 patients, (b) age 36-50 years-363 patients, and (c) age ≥ 50 years-553 patients. The comparability of the groups was assessed in terms of clinical factors (tumor size and race), histopathologic factors (histologic subtype, final resection margin, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, pathologic nodal status), and treatment related factors (reexcision, median total dose to the primary, region(s) treated with radiation, and the use of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen). Outcome was evaluated for overall, relapse-free, and cause-specific survival and patterns of first failure (breast, regional nodes, and distant metastasis). Results: There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of race, clinical tumor size, pathology of the primary tumor, pathologic nodal status, final margin of resection, progesterone receptor status, median total dose to the primary tumor, or the regions treated. However, younger women were significantly more likely to have estrogen receptor negative tumors, undergo reexcision, and receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy without tamoxifen. Younger women were found to have a statistically significantly decreased 8-year actuarial relapse-free survival (53% vs. 67% vs. 74%, p = 0.009), cause-specific survival (73% vs. 84% vs. 90%, p = 0.02), freedom from distant metastasis (76% vs. 75% vs. 83%, p = 0.02), and a significantly increased risk of breast recurrence (24% vs. 14% vs. 12%, p = 0.001), and regional node recurrence (7% vs. 1% vs. 1%, p = 0.0002). The patients were further divided on the basis of their pathologic nodal status. There were no statistically significant differences among the three age groups for axillary node-positive patients for overall survival (75% vs. 80% vs. 74%), relapse-free survival (73% vs. 73% vs. 62%), cause- specific survival (76% vs. 85% vs. 80%), and freedom from distant metastasis (75% vs. 75% vs. 72%), or breast recurrence (0% vs. 9% vs. 6%). The findings were identical when the analysis was restricted to node-positive patients who received chemotherapy. However, for axillary node-negative women, young age was associated with a statistically significant decreased overall survival (71% vs. 83% vs. 92%), relapse-free survival (51% vs. 65% vs. 76%), cause- specific survival (71% vs. 86% vs. 93%), freedom from distant metastasis (77% vs. 76% vs. 88%), and a statistically significant increased risk of breast recurrence (40% vs. 16% vs. 13%), and regional node recurrence (3% vs. 1% vs. 0%). The risk of a breast recurrence in axillary node-negative young women was decreased by the addition of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy but not by the use of reexcision. Conclusions: The present analysis demonstrates that young women with early stage breast cancer do significantly worse when compared to older women in terms of relapse-free survival, cause-specific survival, distant metastasis and breast and regional node recurrence. However, the adverse effect of young age on outcome appears to be limited to the node-negative patients. These findings suggest that node-negative early stage breast cancer in young women is a more aggressive disease, with an increased risk for all patterns of failure and a decreased survival."

We herein present early results of a prospective phase II trial, undergoing at our institution. Materials/Methods: Between June 2011 and December 2012 a total of 63 consecutive EBC patients were treated with HF TD at our Department. Histologically proven left- and right-sided breast adenocarcinoma, (pTis/ pT1/pT2, pN0-N1) after lumpectomy/quadrantectomy, were included (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and trastuzumab allowed). Patients were prescribed 45 Gy/20 fractions to thewhole breast with a concomitant delivery of a SIB dose to the lumpectomy cavity of 0.25 Gy daily up to 5 adjunctive Gy (total nominal dose of 50 Gy/20 fr 2.5 Gy daily), employing TD. The 95% percentage PTV volume should be covered at least by 95% of the prescribed dose. The PTV was restricted to <53.5 Gy at 3% volume. Considered organs at risk for dosimetric constraints were lungs, heart and contralateral breast. TD beam arrangement consisted of 4 to 6 fields according to patient's characteristics and consequent dose distribution. Acute toxicity was scored according to RTOG scale, chronic toxicity according to LENT-SOMA scale, cosmesis was evaluated according to Harvard criteria and quality of life employing EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires Results: All patients completed the planned radiation therapy program with no clinical-related treatment interruptions. Radiation therapy was generally well tolerated; 53 patients (84%) had G0-G1 skin toxicity, while 10 patients experienced RTOG G2 erythema (16%); no grade 3 toxicities were reported. Up to 40 patients achieved a minimal follow-up time of 6 months; among them mild skin late effects were observed (mainly hyperpigmentation; 4% LENT-SOMA G1). Skin cosmesis was judged optimal/good in almost all of these patients (98%). Quality of life was generally good (both globally with QLQC-30 and specifically with QLQ-BR23). As expected no local or systemic relapse were detected by the time of last examination. Conclusions: TD showed to be a feasible and efficient mean to deliver accelerated hypofractionated adjuvant radiation in EBC patients after conserving surgery, with an optimal dose distribution, negligible toxicity and encouraging clinical results. This technical solution is a valid IMRT option for breast radiation treatment."
"Frazier, R. C., et al.",2004,Impact of breathing motion on whole breast radiotherapy: A dosimetric analysis using active breathing control.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose The active breathing control (ABC) apparatus was used to quantify the effect of breathing motion on whole breast radiotherapy (RT) with standard wedges and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). Methods and materials Ten patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent routine free-breathing (FB) CT simulations for whole breast RT. An ABC apparatus was used to obtain two additional CT scans with the breath held at the end of normal inhalation and normal exhalation. The FB scan was used to develop both a standard treatment plan using wedged coplanar tangents and an IMRT plan using multiple static multileaf collimator segments. To simulate breathing, each plan was copied and applied to the normal inhalation and normal exhalation CT scans. Results The medial field border (defined by a radiopaque catheter) for the normal inhalation and normal exhalation scans moved an average of 0.6 cm anteriorly and 0.3 cm posteriorly compared with the FB position, respectively. The corresponding movement of the lateral field border was an average of 0.4 cm anteriorly and 0.2 cm posteriorly compared with the FB position. For both the wedged and the IMRT techniques, the dose delivered to breast tissue, biopsy cavity, and ipsilateral lung was similar for each of the three CT scan positions. However, the internal mammary node dose varied significantly with breathing. Conclusions The dose delivered to breast using standard wedges or step-and-shoot IMRT is relatively insensitive to the effects of breast motion during normal breathing. However, an appreciable portion of the internal mammary nodes are irradiated during normal inhalation, contributing to the uncertainty in the analysis of the efficacy of internal mammary nodal RT in breast treatment.

"Freedman, G. M., et al.",2012,Five-year local control in a phase II study of hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy with an incorporated boost for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Conventional radiation fractionation of 1.8-2 Gy per day for early stage breast cancer requires daily treatment for 6-7 weeks. We report the 5-year results of a phase II study of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), hypofractionation, and incorporated boost that shortened treatment time to 4 weeks. Methods and Materials: The study design was phase II with a planned accrual of 75 patients. Eligibility included patients aged ≥18 years, Tis-T2, stage 0-II, and breast conservation. Photon IMRT and an incorporated boost was used, and the whole breast received 2.25 Gy per fraction for a total of 45 Gy, and the tumor bed received 2.8 Gy per fraction for a total of 56 Gy in 20 treatments over 4 weeks. Patients were followed every 6 months for 5 years. Results: Seventy-five patients were treated from December 2003 to November 2005. The median follow-up was 69 months. Median age was 52 years (range, 31-81). Median tumor size was 1.4 cm (range, 0.1-3.5). Eighty percent of tumors were node negative; 93% of patients had negative margins, and 7% of patients had close (>0 and <2 mm) margins; 76% of cancers were invasive ductal type: 15% were ductal carcinoma in situ, 5% were lobular, and 4% were other histology types. Twenty-nine percent of patients 29% had grade 3 carcinoma, and 20% of patients had extensive in situ carcinoma; 11% of patients received chemotherapy, 36% received endocrine therapy, 33% received both, and 20% received neither. There were 3 instances of local recurrence for a 5-year actuarial rate of 2.7%. Conclusions: This 4-week course of hypofractionated radiation with incorporated boost was associated with excellent local control, comparable to historical results of 6-7 weeks of conventional whole-breast fractionation with sequential boost.

"Freedman, G. M., et al.",2007,Four-Week Course of Radiation for Breast Cancer Using Hypofractionated Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy With an Incorporated Boost.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Standard radiation for early breast cancer requires daily treatment for 6 to 7 weeks. This is an inconvenience to many women, and for some a barrier for breast conservation. We present the acute toxicity of a 4-week course of hypofractionated radiation. Methods and Materials: A total of 75 patients completed radiation on a Phase II trial approved by the hospital institutional review board. Eligibility criteria were broad to include any patient normally eligible for standard radiation: age ≥18 years, invasive or in situ cancer, American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage 0 to II, breast-conserving surgery, and any systemic therapy not given concurrently. The median age was 52 years (range, 31-81 years). Of the patients, 15% had ductal carcinoma in situ, 67% T1, and 19% T2; 71% were N0, 17% N1, and 12% NX. Chemotherapy was given before radiation in 44%. Using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy and incorporated electron beam boost, the whole breast received 45 Gy and the lumpectomy bed 56 Gy in 20 treatments over 4 weeks. Results: The maximum acute skin toxicity by the end of treatment was Grade 0 in 9 patients (12%), Grade 1 in 49 (65%) and Grade 2 in 17 (23%). There was no Grade 3 or higher skin toxicity. After radiation, all Grade 2 toxicity had resolved by 6 weeks. Hematologic toxicity was Grade 0 in most patients except for Grade 1 neutropenia in 2 patients, and Grade 1 anemia in 11 patients. There were no significant differences in baseline vs. 6-week posttreatment patient-reported or physician-reported cosmetic scores. Conclusions: This 4-week course of postoperative radiation using intensity-modulated radiation therapy is feasible and is associated with acceptable acute skin toxicity and quality of life. Long-term follow-up data are needed. This radiation schedule may represent an alternative both to longer 6-week to 7-week standard whole-breast radiation and more radically shortened 1-week, partial-breast treatment schedules.  Inc.

"Freedman, G. M., et al.",2000,Should internal mammary lymph nodes in breast cancer be a target for the radiation oncologist?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The elective treatment of internal mammary lymph nodes (IMNs) in breast cancer is controversial. Previous randomized trials have not shown a benefit to the extended radical mastectomy or elective IMN irradiation overall, but a survival benefit has been suggested by some for subgroups of patients with medial tumors and positive axillary lymph nodes. The advent of effective systemic chemotherapy and potential for serious cardiac morbidity have also been factors leading to the decreased use of IMN irradiation during the past decade. The recent publishing of positive trials testing postmastectomy radiation that had included regional IMN irradiation has renewed interest in their elective treatment. The purpose of this study is to critically review historical and new data regarding IMNs in breast cancer. Methods and Materials: The historical incidence of occult IMN positivity in operable breast cancer is reviewed, and the new information provided by sentinel lymph node studies also discussed. The results of published randomized prospective trials testing the value of elective IMN dissection and/or radiation are analyzed. The data regarding patterns of failure following elective IMN treatment is studied to determine its impact on local-regional control, distant metastases, and survival. A conclusion is drawn regarding the merits of elective IMN treatment based on this review of the literature. Results: Although controversial, the existing data from prospective, randomized trials of IMN treatment do not seem to support their elective dissection or irradiation. While it has not been shown to contribute to a survival benefit, the IMN irradiation increases the risk of cardiac toxicity that has effaced the value of radiation of the chest wall in reducing breast cancer deaths in previous randomized studies and meta-analyses. Sentinel lymph node mapping provides an opportunity to further evaluate the IMN chain in early stage breast cancer. Biopsy of 'hot' nodes may be considered in the future to select patients who are most likely to benefit from additional regional therapy to these nodes. Conclusions: Irradiation of the IMN chain in conjunction with the chest wall and supraclavicular region should be considered only for those with pathologically proven IMNs with the goal of improving tumor regional control.

"Freedman, G. M., et al.",2009,Breast Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Reduces Time Spent With Acute Dermatitis for Women of All Breast Sizes During Radiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To study the time spent with radiation-induced dermatitis during a course of radiation therapy for breast cancer in women treated with conventional or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Methods and Materials: The study population consisted of 804 consecutive women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation from 2001 to 2006. All patients were treated with whole-breast radiation followed by a boost to the tumor bed. Whole-breast radiation consisted of conventional wedged photon tangents (n = 405) earlier in the study period and mostly of photon IMRT (n = 399) in later years. All patients had acute dermatitis graded each week of treatment. Results: The breakdown of the cases of maximum acute dermatitis by grade was as follows: 3%, Grade 0; 34%, Grade 1; 61%, Grade 2; and 2%, Grade 3. The breakdown of cases of maximum toxicity by technique was as follows: 48%, Grade 0/1, and 52%, Grade 2/3, for IMRT; and 25%, Grade 0/1, and 75%, Grade 2/3, for conventional radiation therapy (p < 0.0001). The IMRT patients spent 82% of weeks during treatment with Grade 0/1 dermatitis and 18% with Grade 2/3 dermatitis, compared with 29% and 71% of patients, respectively, treated with conventional radiation (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the time spent with Grade 2/3 toxicity was decreased in IMRT patients with small (p = 0.0015), medium (p < 0.0001), and large (p < 0.0001) breasts. Conclusions: Breast IMRT is associated with a significant decrease both in the time spent during treatment with Grade 2/3 dermatitis and in the maximum severity of dermatitis compared with that associated with conventional radiation, regardless of breast size.

"Fung, M. C., et al.",1997,Early-stage bilateral breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive irradiation: The University of Pennsylvania experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine whether patients with early-stage bilateral breast cancer can be treated with definitive irradiation following breast-conserving surgery with acceptable survival, local control, complications, and cosmesis. Methods and Materials: During the period 1977-1992, 55 women with Stage 0, I, or II concurrent (n = 12) or sequential (n = 43) bilateral breast cancer were treated with definitive irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. The records of these 55 patients with 110 treated breasts were reviewed for tumor size, histology, pathologic axillary lymph node status, first and overall site(s) of failure, and adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Curves for survival, local control, and regional control were determined. Cosmetic outcome, complication rates, and matching technique were analyzed. The median total radiation dose delivered was 64 Gy (range 4272) using tangential whole- breast irradiation followed by an electron or iridium implant boost. The tangential fields were matched with no overlap in 40 patients (73%); there was overlap on skin of up to 4 cm in 14 patients (25%); and the matching technique was unknown in 1 patient (2%). The median follow-up for the 12 women with concurrent bilateral breast cancer was 4.0 years. The median follow-up for the other 43 women with sequential cancer was 9.3 and 4.9 years, respectively, after the first and second cancers. Results: For the overall group of 55 patients, the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 96% and 94%, respectively, after treatment of the first cancer, and 96% and 92%, respectively, after treatment of the second cancer. The 5- and 10-year actuarial relapse-free survival rates were 90% and 75%, respectively, after treatment of the first cancer, and 83% and 72%, respectively, after treatment of the second cancer. For the 110 treated breast cancers, the 5- and 10-year actuarial local failure rates were 5% and 15%, respectively. Complication rates were: 28% breast edema, 8% arm edema, 4% pneumonitis, 3% cellulitis, 1% rib fracture and 1% brachial plexopathy; no patient developed matchline fibrosis. For patients with a minimum of 3 years of relapse-free follow-up, the rate of excellent or good cosmetic outcome for 104 treated breasts was 85%. Conclusion: Definitive irradiation after breast-conserving surgery is technically feasible for selected patients with concurrent or sequential early-stage bilateral breast cancer. Survival, local control, complication rates, and cosmetic outcomes appear comparable to historical reports of breast conservation treatment for unilateral disease. Bilateral definitive breast irradiation after breast-conservation surgery should be considered an acceptable alternative treatment to bilateral mastectomy for selected patients with concurrent or sequential early-stage bilateral breast cancer."
"Galper, S., et al.",2005,Prognosis after local recurrence after conservative surgery and radiation for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"To determine the long-term prognosis of patients who develop a local recurrence (LR) after conservative surgery (CS) and radiation therapy (RT) for early-stage invasive breast cancer. Between 1970 and 1987, 2102 patients with clinical Stage I-II breast cancer were treated with CS+RT. LR was defined as any recurrence within the ipsilateral breast with or without simultaneous regional nodal or distant metastasis. Patients were at risk for a LR until the first of distant metastases, second nonbreast malignancy, or death (DF/S/D). The final study population comprised 341 patients with LR. The median time to LR was 72 months. The median follow-up time after LR was 85 months. A proportional hazards model of time from LR to DF/S/D was done to investigate the influence of factors at initial diagnosis and at LR on subsequent outcome. The actuarial freedom from DF/S/D 5 years after LR was 65% and the survival was 81%. Variables significantly associated with time to DF/S/D were: LR histology (invasive vs. ductal carcinoma in situ, hazard ratio [HR] = 4.1, p < 0.0001); local therapy for LR (none vs. mastectomy or unknown, HR = 3.2, p < 0.0001; and CS ± RT vs. mastectomy or unknown, HR = 2.0, p = 0.02); time to LR (≤2 years vs. >5 years, HR = 2.6, p < 0.0001; and 2-5 years vs. >5 years, HR = 1.8, p = 0.006); and age at initial diagnosis (<60 vs. <60, HR = 1.6, p = 0.01). Many patients with LR after CS+RT have prolonged distant disease-free survival, particularly those able to be treated with mastectomy. Patients with a noninvasive LR, longer interval to LR, or age <60 had a longer time to distant failure, second malignancy, or death than other patients.  Inc."
"Galper, S., et al.",2002,Second nonbreast malignancies after conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy are at risk of developing second nonbreast malignancies (SNBMs). The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of all SNBMs and SNBMs by specific location among long-term survivors and to compare the risk of these events to the age-specific incidence of malignances as first cancers in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Results Program (SEER) population. Methods and Materials: We analyzed the likelihood of SNBM development for 1884 patients with clinical Stage I or II breast cancer treated with gross excision and ≥60 Gy (median 63) to the breast between 1970 and 1987. Fifty-seven percent received supraclavicular/axillary radiation (median dose 45 Gy, range 20-60) and 28% received systemic therapy. The median age at diagnosis was 52 years. The median clinical tumor size was 2 cm. Patients were considered at risk of an SNBM until the development of the first of distant metastases or contralateral breast cancer or death or, if alive and disease-free, until the last follow-up visit. The expected numbers of cancers were obtained from the SEER database, using the age-specific incidence for white women within 5-year age groups and 5-year calendar intervals. The median time at risk for an SNBM was 10.9 years (range 0.2-27.9). Results: By 8 years of follow-up, 432 patients (23%) had developed distant metastases, 295 patients (16%) a local/regional recurrence, and 159 (8%) a contralateral primary. Of the 1884 patients in our cohort, 147 (8%) developed an SNBM compared with the 127.7 expected from SEER. This corresponds to an absolute excess of 1% of the study population and a relative increase of 15% greater than that expected from SEER (p = 0.05). Within the first 5 years, the observed and expected rates of SNBMs were identical (47 vs. 46.9). After 5 years, 24% more SNBMs were observed than expected (100 vs. 80.8, p = 0.02). Among patients <50 years old at breast cancer diagnosis, 43% more observed SNBMs occurred than expected (40 vs. 28, p = 0.02). For patients ≥50 years, 7% more SNBMs were observed than expected (107 vs. 99.7, p = 0.25). Lung SNBMs were observed in 33 women, 52% more than the 21.67 predicted by SEER (p = 0.01). Most of the lung SNBMs occurred >5 years after treatment (n = 23) and in women who were >50 years at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis (n = 27). The observed incidence of ovarian cancer was significantly greater than expected among patients <50 years (7 vs. 1.96, p = 0.004) but was not different than expected for patients ≥50 years (5 vs. 5.3, p = 0.61). Among the 7 sarcomas, 3 developed in the radiation field. Conclusions: SNBMs occur in a substantial minority (8%) of patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy. However, the absolute excess risk compared with the general population is very small (1%). This excess risk is only evident after 5 years. In particular, a slightly increased incidence of lung SNBMs and a somewhat larger increase in ovarian cancer among younger patients was found. Our data suggest that preventive strategies to reduce the incidence of certain cancers (e.g., smoking cessation and prophylactic oophorectomy) and/or continued monitoring for SNBMs to increase the likelihood of early detection and treatment may be prudent in this population.

"Galper, S., et al.",1999,Factors associated with regional nodal failure in patients with early stage breast cancer with 0-3 positive axillary nodes following tangential irradiation alone.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Recent randomized trials have suggested that improved local- regional control after radiation therapy significantly increases survival for breast cancer patients with positive axillary nodes treated with adjuvant systemic therapy (1, 2). It has been our policy to use a third radiation field only in patients with 4 or more positive nodes. The purpose of this study was to assess whether there are any clinical or pathologic factors associated with an increased risk of regional nodal failure (RNF) in patients with 0-3 positive nodes treated with tangential radiotherapy (RT) alone with or without systemic therapy. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of RNF for 691 patients with clinical Stage I or II invasive breast cancer treated with complete gross excision of the primary tumor and tangential RT alone between 1978-87; 12% also received systemic therapy. All had 0-3 positive nodes on axillary dissection that had histologic examination of ≥ 6 nodes, and all had potential 8-year follow-up. The median number of axillary nodes removed was 11 (range 6-36). RNF was defined as any recurrence in ipsilateral axillary, internal mammary, supraclavicular, or infraclavicular nodes in the absence of recurrence in the breast, with or without simultaneous distant metastasis. Crude rates for first sites of failure within the first 8 years after treatment were calculated. A polychotomous logistic regression was used to identify factors prognostic for RNF and other sites of first failure. Results: Within 8 years, RNF was the first site of failure for 27 patients for a crude 8-year rate of 3.9%. Isolated axillary failure occurred in 8 patients (1.2%). Isolated supraclavicular and/or infraclavicular failure occurred in 5 (1.3%) and 3 (0.4%) patients, respectively. Isolated internal mammary node failure occurred in 2 patients (0.3%). A polychotomous logistic regression model of first site of failure (local failure, regional nodal, distant/opposite breast, dead without recurrence, no evidence of disease) within 8 years found age < 50 years, moderate or marked necrosis, size greater than 1 cm, and presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC) to be significantly correlated with site of first failure, but only the last two were associated with a significantly larger relative risk of RNF versus being no evidence of disease at 8 years. The incidence of RNF was 0.7% for patients with tumors ≤ 1 cm compared to 5.7% among patients with larger tumors. Among patients with EIC-positive tumors the incidence of RNF was 7.6% compared to 3.1% among those whose tumors were EIC-negative. Conclusions: Although the incidence of RNF has been shown to be somewhat higher in patients with tumors measuring greater than 1 cm and those with an EIC, RNF is uncommon among all subsets of patients with negative or 1-3 positive lymph nodes treated with conservative surgery, axillary dissection, and only tangential RT fields. Therefore, giving only tangential RT (without a separate nodal field) appears generally acceptable for patients with 0-3 positive nodes."
"Ganju, R. G., et al.",2017,An analysis of the utilization of hypofractionated regimens for early stage breast cancer at a tertiary care cancer center and its community-based affiliates.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that hypofractionation (HF) radiation regimens are equivalent to conventional fractionation schemes (CF) with respect to both outcomes and toxicity. Despite the cost savings associated with HF and the highly publicized endorsements by major regulatory organizations, adoption of these regimens has been slow. We reviewed use of HF in one cancer care network in an attempt to identify potential predictors of utilization. Purpose/Objective(s): Breast cancer patients treated within our cancer care network with external-beam radiation following lumpectomy in 2016 were evaluated. Exclusion criteria included male gender, bilateral breast cancer, requirement of a third field to the supraclavicular nodes, and partial breast irradiation. For purposes of data collection, radiation courses with a dose per fraction > 2 Gy were considered HF, whereas those ≤ 2 Gy were considered CF. Patient, provider and tumor characteristics were categorized by use of HF and compared between groups using a chi-square test or 2-tailed t-test. Results: A total of 233 consecutive patients were identified that met aforementioned criteria. All 69 patients treated at the main academic site received HF. For patients treated at community-based facilities, there was significant variation among the providers, with use of HF ranging from 25.9% to 89.7% (p<0.001). Referral from an academic versus community based surgeon was not associated with HF for the entire group. However, for individual providers there was significant bias for HF when referring surgeon was academic, 62.5% vs 10.5% (p=0.01). The use of HF occurred in 72.4%, 48.5%, and 28.2% of patients respectively for grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors. Thirty-five percent of patients receiving chemotherapy underwent HF as compared to 58% for patients without chemotherapy (p=0.01). 58% percent of stage I patients and 32% of stage II patients received HF radiation (p=0.03). Age and tumor subtype did not significantly impact use of HF (p=0.15, p=0.17). Furthermore, only 60.4% of patients over 70 and 54.6% of hormone positive patients receiving HF. The use of HF was 59.6% in patients who were combined hormone positive, over 50, and not receiving chemotherapy. There was increased use of HF after the implementation of institutional-wide prospective peer-review, 51.3% vs 61.1%, though this was not statistically significant (p=0.44). Conclusion: Despite level I evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of HF, significant variation in its use persists among providers. Despite strong guidelines supporting HF in patients over 50 with T1-2N0 disease, not receiving chemotherapy, a significant proportion of patients treated at our center continue to receive CF. Increased awareness and oversight through educational conferences such as peer-review may be useful in improving compliance to HF."
"Gao, X., et al.",2003,Risk of second primary cancer in the contralateral breast in women treated for early-stage breast cancer: A population-based study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To study the potential risk factors, including radiotherapy (RT) for contralateral breast cancer (CBC), in patients treated for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1973-1996) was used to study the incidence of CBC after breast cancer. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of CBC, with adjustment for confounders, including age, race, histologic subtype, and use of RT. Information on the use of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy was not available in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Results: A CBC was documented in 5679 (4.2%) of the 134,501 localized invasive or intraductal breast cancer patients surviving at least 3 months. The 10- and 20-year actuarial rate of CBC was 6.1% and 12%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, medullary carcinoma (RR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.37), black race (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.08-1.33), and age >55 years at initial diagnosis (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22) were associated with increased CBC risk. A total of 1234 (3.3%) of 37,379 patients who received RT developed CBC, and 4445 (4.6%) of 97,122 patients who did not receive RT developed CBC. Overall, RT was not associated with an increased risk of CBC (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.10) in multivariate analysis. The CBC risk associated with RT varied substantially with the length of follow-up. During the first 5 years of follow-up, RT was not associated with an increased CBC risk (age-adjusted RR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.04). For patients surviving for >5 years, RT was associated with a 14% increase in CBC risk (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.26). The increased CBC risk with RT was evident in patients aged <45 years (RR = 1.32, p = 0.01) and >55 years (RR = 1.15, p = 0.04) at initial diagnosis. The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year actuarial rate of CBC was 2.9%, 6.5%, 10.2%, and 13.4%, respectively, for patients with RT; the corresponding rates were 3.0%, 6.0%, 8.9%, and 11.8% for patients without RT. The absolute increase in CBC risk associated with RT was 0.5%, 1.3%, and 1.6% in the 10-, 15-, and 20-year actuarial rate, respectively. Conclusion: CBC is not uncommon after breast cancer, especially for certain subsets of patients. RT was associated with a very small increased long-term CBC risk. This minimal increase in CBC risk should not affect clinical decision-making in treatment selection for patients with localized invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Unnecessary radiation exposure to the contralateral breast should be avoided for all patients with early-stage breast cancer.  Inc."
"Garda, A. E., et al.",2017,Adoption of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer in a community based radiation oncology practice.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Despite strong level one evidence and incorporation into the ASTRO evidence-based guidelines in July 2010, hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) utilization remains suboptimal. Population-based analyses have demonstrated that HF-WBI is utilized in only 30-40% of eligible patients. In 2012, our community-based cancer program developed a multidisciplinary breast tumor board across three clinical sites to standardize care. Herein is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, of the impact of a multidisciplinary tumor board on HF-WBI utilization in a community-based practice. Purpose/Objective(s): Our institutional tumor registry was queried for patients with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ who were treated between January 2006 and December 2015. Eligible cases included women age ≥50 years with stage 0-IIA breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation. HF-WBI courses were defined as courses in which radiation was completed in ≤20 fractions with daily dose of >2.0 Gy. The primary outcome was use of conventionally-fractionated vs. hypofractionated WBI. Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the use of HF-WBI. Results: We identified 1,067 patients who met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The proportion receiving HF-WBI was strongly associated with year (Table 1, p<0.0001) and increased from 1.8% prior to 2010 to 80.3% in 2015. Multivariable analysis identified that the factors associated with increased use of HF-WBI were later year of treatment, no chemotherapy, older age, grade I-II, and treatment at hospital A. Other factors including race, insurance type, residence in an outside county, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, and extent of lymph node evaluation were not significant. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the adoption of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation for patients with early stage breast cancer strongly accelerated after the implementation of an institutional multidisciplinary breast tumor board. This locally-based mechanism may be effective for facilitating adoption of national guidelines. Community-based radiation oncology practices could consider similar measures to increase utilization for eligible patients."
"Garsa, A. A., et al.",2011,Quality of life of patients treated with breast conserving surgery and high dose rate interstitial brachytherapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To examine quality of life (QOL) of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: Between March 2004 and December 2008, 151 patients with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective institutional protocol evaluating APBI using HDR interstitial brachytherapy after breast conserving surgery at Washington University School of Medicine. Eligible patients included those with Tis-T2 tumors measuring ≤ 3 cm excised with negative surgical margins, with no nodal involvement. Patients received 3.4 Gy bid to a total dose of 34 Gy. QOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 version 3.0 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. QLQ-C30 measures physical, emotional, and social health issues relevant to cancer patients and is comprised of three categories: global health status (GHS)/QOL, functional scales and symptom scales. QLQ-BR23 is a breast cancer specific module, and is scored identical to the functional and symptom scales of QLQ-C30. The QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 were given to patients pretreatment, at the completion of brachytherapy, 6-8 weeks, 3-4 months, and 6-8 months post-treatment, then every 6 months for the next 4.5 years and yearly thereafter. The paired t-test was used to compare pretreatment and post-treatment mean scores at an early and late time point. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All tests were two-sided. Results: Median follow-up was 55 months. At 3-4 months post-treatment, the mean scores of breast symptoms, future perspective and sexual function were significantly improved compared to pretreatment. There was significant worsening of the systemic therapy side effects and dyspnea mean scores. The remainder of the scales was not significantly different from pretreatment levels. At 2 years post-treatment, the mean of 8 of 23 scales was significantly improved over the pretreatment mean score. Namely, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, role functioning, future perspective, sexual functioning and financial difficulties were improved. The remainder of the scales was not significantly different from pretreatment levels. Conclusions: Mean QOL scores improved or returned to pretreatment levels 3-4 months after brachytherapy, with the exception of systemic therapy side effects and dyspnea. QOL improved over time, with overall improvement in 8 of 23 scales 2 years after treatment. Multicatheter brachytherapy does not convey lasting reductions in QOL."

Materials/Methods: Between March 2004 and December 2008, 151 patients with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective institutional protocol evaluating APBI using HDR multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy after breast conserving surgery at Washington University School of Medicine. Eligible patients included those with Tis-T2 tumors measuring ≤ 3 cm excised with negative surgical margins, with no nodal involvement. Patients received 3.4 Gy bid to a total dose of 34 Gy. Cosmetic outcomes were evaluated qualitatively by the patient and treating radiation oncologist (IZ) and quantitatively by the percentage breast retraction assessment (pBRA). Qualitative evaluation by patient and physician used the Harris scale (excellent, good, fair, poor). Cosmetic evaluation was done pretreatment (pretx), 6-8 weeks post-treatment, 3-4 months post-treatment, 6-8 months posttreatment, then every 6 months for the next 4.5 years and yearly thereafter. The paired t-test was used to assess changes in mean pBRA at an early and late time point. The kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between patient and physician global cosmetic evaluation. Results: The median follow-up was 55 months. Compared to the pretreatment mean pBRA (7.35), there was no significant difference in mean pBRA at 3-4 months (8.09,p=0.21) and 2 years post-treatment (8.30,p=0.15). Patients reported excellent/good outcomes as follows: 92% pretx, 91% at 3-4 months follow-up, 87% at 2 years, and 92% at 3 years. The physician reported excellent/ good outcomes as follows: 97% pretx, 97% at 3-4 months follow-up, 94% at 2 years, and 94% at 3 years. Agreement between patient and physician evaluation using dichotomized cosmetic outcomes (excellent/good or fair/poor) at each time point was poor-slight (k = 0.13-0.37). Conclusions: There is no significant difference in mean pBRA up to two years after treatment. Although patient and physician agreement was low, there was a very high rate of excellent/good cosmetic outcomes in both patient and physician assessments. Multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy does not significantly change breast size as measured by pBRA over time."
"Garsa, A. A., et al.",2011,Fat necrosis after breast conserving surgery and high dose rate interstitial brachytherapy for earlystage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To examine the incidence of and potential predictors of fat necrosis in women treated with high dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Between 2003 and 2010, 238 treated breasts in 236 patients with at least 6 months follow-up were treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using HDR interstitial brachytherapy at Washington University School of Medicine. Patients with Tis-T2 tumors measuring # 3 cm excised with negative surgical margins, with no nodal involvement were candidates for treatment. Ninety-nine percent of treatments (n = 236) were 3.4 Gy B.I.D. to a total dose of 34 Gy (range, 30-40 Gy). The actuarial rate of fat necrosis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between patient, tumor and treatment characteristics including: age, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, case number, number of catheters, V100, V150, V200, IRAK, dose homogeneity index, defined as 1-(V150/V100), and acute infection and the development of fat necrosis. Global cosmetic results were scored as excellent, good, fair or poor by the treating radiation oncologist at each follow-up. Fisher's exact test was used to identify the effect of fat necrosis on cosmetic outcome. The worst cosmetic outcome was used for analysis. Results: Median follow-up was 56 months (range, 6-94 months). The crude rate of fat necrosis was 17.6%. The median time to fat necrosis was 21 months. The rate of asymptomatic fat necrosis was 7.6%, and the rate of symptomatic fat necrosis was 10%. Three patients (1.3%) had surgical intervention. In univariate analysis, acute breast infection and anthracycline-based chemotherapy were significantly associated with fat necrosis (p = 0.045 and 0.043, respectively). Treatment-related factors including number of catheters, V100, V150, V200 and IRAK were also significantly associated with fat necrosis. There was significant collinearity between the treatment-related factors, with V150 most predictive (p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, only V150 was significantly associated with fat necrosis (p = 0.004, odds ratio 1.021, 95% CI 1.007-1.035). 95% of treated breasts had an excellent/good cosmetic outcome. Fat necrosis was significantly associated with a fair/poor cosmetic outcome (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Mammary fat necrosis is a common adverse event after breast conserving surgery and HDR interstitial brachytherapy. Fat necrosis is associated with worse cosmetic outcomes. V150 is the dominant factor associated with fat necrosis in this study."
"Garsa, A. A., et al.",2013,Cosmetic analysis following breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for early-stage breast cancer: A prospective clinical study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To prospectively evaluate cosmetic outcomes in women treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation using high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Between 2004 and 2008, 151 patients with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in a phase 2 prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients had stage Tis-T2 tumors of ≤3 cm that were excised with negative margins and with no nodal involvement. Patients received 3.4 Gy twice daily to a total dose of 34 Gy. Both the patients and the treating radiation oncologist qualitatively rated cosmesis as excellent, good, fair, or poor over time and ascribed a cause for changes in cosmesis. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated quantitatively by percentage of breast retraction assessment (pBRA). Patients also reported their satisfaction with treatment over time. Results: Median follow-up was 55 months. The rates of excellent-to-good cosmesis reported by patients and the treating radiation oncologist were 92% and 97% pretreatment, 91% and 97% at 3 to 4 months' follow-up, 87% and 94% at 2 years, and 92% and 94% at 3 years, respectively. Breast infection and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent predictors of a fair-to-poor cosmetic outcome at 3 years. Compared to pretreatment pBRA (7.35), there was no significant change in pBRA over time. The volume receiving more than 150 Gy (V150) was the only significant predictor of pBRA. The majority of patients (86.6%) were completely satisfied with their treatment. Conclusions: Patients and the treating physician reported a high rate of excellent-to-good cosmetic outcomes at all follow-up time points. Acute breast infection and chemotherapy were associated with worse cosmetic outcomes. Multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy does not significantly change breast size as measured by pBRA.  Inc.

"Garsa, A. A., et al.",2013,A prospective longitudinal clinical trial evaluating quality of life after breast-conserving surgery and high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To prospectively examine quality of life (QOL) of patients with early stage breast cancer treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy. Methods and Materials Between March 2004 and December 2008, 151 patients with early stage breast cancer were enrolled in a phase 2 prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients included those with Tis-T2 tumors measuring ≤3 cm excised with negative surgical margins and with no nodal involvement. Patients received 3.4 Gy twice daily to a total dose of 34 Gy. QOL was measured using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, version 3.0, and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. The QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires were evaluated during pretreatment and then at 6 to 8 weeks, 3 to 4 months, 6 to 8 months, and 1 and 2 years after treatment. Results The median follow-up was 55 months. Breast symptom scores remained stable in the months after treatment, and they significantly improved 6 to 8 months after treatment. Scores for emotional functioning, social functioning, and future perspective showed significant improvement 2 years after treatment. Symptomatic fat necrosis was associated with several changes in QOL, including increased pain, breast symptoms, systemic treatment side effects, dyspnea, and fatigue, as well as decreased role functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning. Conclusions HDR multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy was well tolerated, with no significant detrimental effect on measured QOL scales/items through 2 years of follow-up. Compared to pretreatment scores, there was improvement in breast symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, and future perspective 2 years after treatment.  The Authors.

"Gebhardt, B. J., et al.",2018,"Standardization of nodal radiation therapy through changes to a breast cancer clinical pathway throughout a large, integrated cancer center network.",Practical Radiation Oncology,"Background: Studies demonstrate safety of omitting axillary nodal dissection for early-stage breast cancer with positive sentinel lymph node (+SLN) biopsy, although trial designs differed in radiation therapy (RT) fields. Regional nodal irradiation was separately shown to improve outcomes in high-risk patients. This led to lack of consensus in RT volumes. Clinical pathways (CPs) standardize care where practice varies unnecessarily. We evaluated the impact of changes to a CP guiding postoperative RT in women with +SLNs on practice patterns throughout a network. Methods and materials: We implemented a CP for management of breast cancer with postoperative RT designed to promote uniform nodal treatment. The CP recommended modified tangents (MTs) including level I/II nodes for women with micrometastases (pN1mi). For women with macrometastases (pN1a), CPs recommended including level I/II LN in MT and a third supraclavicular node (SCN) LN ± internal mammary nodes for women with adverse factors present. Results: RT fields of 233 women undergoing breast-conserving surgery with +SLN but not axillary nodal dissection were retrospectively reviewed: 25% had pN1mi disease and 75% pN1a. Of 127 women treated before CP changes, 35% with pN1mi and 22% with pN1a were treated with whole-breast irradiation alone. Following CP changes, 106 women were treated: 5% with whole-breast irradiation alone, 58% with MT, and 38% with MT + SCN field. Utilization of MT was associated with CP changes. Utilization of a third SCN field was associated with CP changes, pN stage, extracapsular extension, and total number of adverse factors. Conclusions: CPs translate published data and institutional experience into management plans that promote evidence-based care and eliminate unnecessary practice variations. Recognizing that postoperative RT treatment volumes were heterogeneous, we modified the CP based upon the latest evidence for regional nodal irradiation, after which we found increased compliance and consistency with quality guidelines, which will also aid in tracking outcomes in future investigations."
"Gee, H. E., et al.",2015,MicroRNA-related DNA repair/cell-cycle genes independently associated with relapse after radiation therapy for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Local recurrence and distant failure after adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer remain significant clinical problems, incompletely predicted by conventional clinicopathologic markers. We had previously identified microRNA-139-5p and microRNA-1274a as key regulators of breast cancer radiation response in vitro. The purpose of this study was to investigate standard clinicopathologic markers of local recurrence in a contemporary series and to establish whether putative target genes of microRNAs involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control could better predict radiation therapy response in vivo. Methods and Materials With institutional ethics board approval, local recurrence was measured in a contemporary, prospectively collected series of 458 patients treated with radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery. Additionally, independent publicly available mRNA/microRNA microarray expression datasets totaling >1000 early-stage breast cancer patients, treated with adjuvant radiation therapy, with >10 years of follow-up, were analyzed. The expression of putative microRNA target biomarkers - TOP2A, POLQ, RAD54L, SKP2, PLK2, and RAG1 - were correlated with standard clinicopathologic variables using 2-sided nonparametric tests, and to local/distant relapse and survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. Results We found a low rate of isolated local recurrence (1.95%) in our modern series, and that few clinicopathologic variables (such as lymphovascular invasion) were significantly predictive. In multiple independent datasets (n>1000), however, high expression of RAD54L, TOP2A, POLQ, and SKP2 significantly correlated with local recurrence, survival, or both in univariate and multivariate analyses (P<.001). Low RAG1 expression significantly correlated with local recurrence (multivariate, P=.008). Additionally, RAD54L, SKP2, and PLK2 may be predictive, being prognostic in radiation therapy-treated patients but not in untreated matched control individuals (n=107; P<.05). Conclusions Biomarkers of DNA repair and cell cycle control can identify patients at high risk of treatment failure in those receiving radiation therapy for early breast cancer in independent cohorts. These should be further investigated prospectively, especially TOP2A and SKP2, for which targeted therapies are available."
"Geng, A. B., et al.",2013,Early results of a prospective cohort study on intraoperative radiation therapy for early breast cancer at a single institution.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Targeted Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) has been explored in clinical studies and used as an alternative to conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI) in early stage breast cancers. It can be advantageous for well-selected patients to avoid 3-6 weeks of post-operative WBI. It also eliminates any uncertainty in localization of the surgical bed in external beam (EBRT) boost. The results of the randomized controlled trial TARGIT-A have been published to demonstrate non-inferiority to WBI in properly selected early breast cancer patients. TARGIT-B, an ongoing trial, compares the outcomes of tumor bed boost delivered by external beam and IORT. Our study utilizes the ASTRO 2009 consensus guideline, the TARGIT-A and TARGIT-B criteria in selecting patients. We report the early radiation treatment related outcomes of our single institution prospective cohort study using the Intrabeam system. Materials/Methods: All eligible patients were entered consecutively into the cohort. Patients meeting criteria of the ASTRO consensus and TARGIT- A trial received IORT as the sole definitive radiation treatment. If surgical pathology revealed findings incompatible with IORT alone, EBRT was added. Patients who did not qualify for IORT as a single modality were eligible to receive IORT as a boost in lieu of an EBRT boost, similar to the TARGIT-B trial. The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale, IORT related and surgical outcomes were assessed. Results: Sixty-nine patients were entered into the cohort between September 2011 and October 2012. Four patients did not subsequently receive IORT. Among the remaining 65 patients treated with IORT, the average age was 63.3 years with a median follow-up of 13 months. Tumors are 15% DCIS vs 85% invasive cancer (71% pT1 and 14% pT2). Eighty-five percent of patients are N0 or N1 (mi). The remaining 15% are N1. Hormone receptor status is ER+ 94%, PR+85% and Her2+ 7%. 67.7% received IORT alone, while 32.3% had additional EBRT. The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale was measured at 3, 6, and 12 months. Cosmesis was rated as 77% excellent outcome, while 23% good with no fair or poor results. Acute RTOG G3 and G4 complications were 1.5% and 3.1%. Two G4 radionecrosis cases received EBRT. Hyperbaric O2 was given with recovery at follow-ups. Post-operative complications included surgery in 7.7% for wound infection and 1.5% for surgically evacuated hematomas. No patients required having >3 aspirations of a seroma. No long-term complications were noted. Conclusions: Acute complication rates in patients who received IORT alone are comparable to the results of the TARGIT-A trial. IORT as a boost in addition to EBRT may affect those rates. The TARGIT-B trial will further elucidate this question. Excellent and good cosmetic outcomes are achievable in this early report of our study."
"Gianni, L., et al.",2010,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab followed by adjuvant trastuzumab versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer (the NOAH trial): a randomised controlled superiority trial with a parallel HER2-negative cohort.",The Lancet,"Background: The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has survival benefit when given with chemotherapy to patients with early, operable, and metastatic breast cancer that has HER2 (also known as ERBB2) overexpression or amplification. We aimed to assess event-free survival in patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without 1 year of trastuzumab. Methods: We compared 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab (given as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment; n=117) with no trastuzumab (118), in women with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer treated with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen consisting of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Randomisation was done with a computer program and minimisation technique, taking account of geographical area, disease stage, and hormone receptor status. Investigators were informed of treatment allocation. A parallel cohort of 99 patients with HER2-negative disease was included and treated with the same chemotherapy regimen. Primary endpoint was event-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN86043495. Findings: Trastuzumab significantly improved event-free survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (3-year event-free survival, 71% [95% CI 61-78; n=36 events] with trastuzumab, vs 56% [46-65; n=51 events] without; hazard ratio 0·59 [95% CI 0·38-0·90]; p=0·013). Trastuzumab was well tolerated and, despite concurrent administration with doxorubicin, only two patients (2%) developed symptomatic cardiac failure. Both responded to cardiac drugs. Interpretation: The addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for women with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer to improve event-free survival, survival, and clinical and pathological tumour responses.

"Gilbo, P., et al.",2016,Utilization of hypofractionated breast treatment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated (HF) whole breast irradiation has become a standard treatment regimen as randomized trials continue to demonstrate equivalence in survival and local control compared to conventional fractionation (CF). Since 2011, ASTRO has adopted clinical guidelines to help guide clinicians in the proper selection of patients to receive HF. However, utilization of this treatment continues to be limited in the United States. Materials/Methods: Beginning in 2010, our department implemented a series of consensus driven and evidence based clinical directives to guide patient selection. Within breast cancer, there were 7 treatment directives that our physicians could select based upon specific inclusion criteria and in combination with their own clinical judgment. Beginning in 2012, our department instituted peer-reviewed contour rounds wherein the treating physician had to further support their decision on using a specific directive. We examined our prospectively gathered patient data for our early stage breast cancer patients receiving CF versus HF whole breast irradiation regimens from 2011 through 2015. Two groups were identified for analysis: one that would be endorsed by ASTRO guidelines (aged = 50, T1-T2N0 with no prior chemotherapy) and a more general cohort encouraged by our clinical directives (Tis-T2, N0-Nmi, with no prior chemotherapy and with no age limit). Results: For the ASTRO endorsed group (n = 685), 68% received HF therapy since 2011 and 80% received HF therapy in 2015. For the more general cohort encouraged by our clinical directives (n = 1042), 61% received HF therapy since 2011 and 73% received HF therapy in 2015. Conclusion: These results indicate that we were able to achieve HF utilization for breast cancer that exceeds the national average (68% vs 35%), but this remains less than ideal. Factors that may have positively contributed to these results include the implementation of evidence-based treatment directives and a culture that allows the choice of any directive as long as it is supported by recommended patient characteristics. One factor that has held back the widespread utilization of HF is the anecdotal concern of increased side effects with this approach, but given recent data suggesting more favorable side effect profiles with HF, we expect the utilization of this modality to increase."
"Gillespie, E. F., et al.",2016,The impact of radiation oncology provider on the likelihood of receiving hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Despite long-term data from randomized controlled trials showing the equal efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer, the United States has been slow to adopt this treatment. Understanding factors driving this variation in patterns of care is critical to impact change. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of individual radiation oncologists on the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: We identified 22,233 Medicare beneficiaries with localized breast cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2011 that underwent breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiation. Medicare claims were used to determine radiation regimen and identify the individual radiation oncologists. Secondary linkage with data from the American Medical Association (AMA) introduced demographic information about individual physicians and their practice settings. Multi-level, multivariable logistic models clustered by radiation oncologist and geographic region were used to determine the impact of radiation oncologists on the likelihood of hypofractionation while controlling for a patient's clinical and demographic covariates and a physician's demographic and practice information. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to describe the impact of fixed demographic or clinical covariates, and the median odds ratio (MOR) was used to describe the relative impact of the geographic region and individual radiation oncologist on the likelihood of receiving hypofractionation. Results: Among the entire cohort, 2,333 women (10.4%) were treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy. Unadjusted rates of hypofractionation ranged from 0.0% in the bottom quintile of radiation oncologists to 30.4% in the top quintile. Multivariable analysis found that the individual radiation oncologist (MOR = 3.08) had a greater impact on the usage of hypofractionation than geographic region (MOR = 2.10) or all other clinical and demographic variables other than a later year of diagnosis (2008-2009, OR = 3.71; 2010-2011, OR = 7.98). Radiation oncologists that treat the greatest number of breast cancer patients were less likely to use hypofractionation (OR = 0.62) while female providers were slightly more likely to use hypofractionation (OR = 1.31, all P values < 0.05). Conclusion: The individual radiation oncologist strongly influences the likelihood of hypofractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of localized breast cancer. Further research should focus on specific physician-and patient-related biases and beliefs that influence this decision making process."
"Goldhirsch, A., et al.",2013,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): An open-label, randomised controlled trial.",The Lancet,"Background Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene. The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown. We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial. Methods The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events. The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032. Findings We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·85-1·14, p=0·86). Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20·4%] vs 275 [16·3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7·2%] vs 69 [4·1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively). HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0·76 (95% CI 0·67-0·86, p<0·0001) for disease-free survival and 0·76 (0·65-0·88, p=0·0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy. Interpretation 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. 1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.

"Goodman, C. R., et al.",2019,Circulating Tumor Cell Status As a Predictive Biomarker to Guide Radiotherapy Decisions in Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Preliminary evidence suggests circulating tumor cell (CTC) status may be an effective predictor of benefit of radiotherapy (RT) following breast conserving surgery (BCS) among women with low-risk early-stage breast cancer (EBC). A cost utility analysis was performed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of biomarker-directed recommendation for adjuvant RT based on CTC status in this population. Materials/Methods: A Markov model was developed using a model building analysis tool software to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained for biomarker-directed treatment based on CTC-status and standard of care. Micro-costing was performed to estimate costs associated with hypofractionated whole breast RT (with or without a boost) and peripheral blood analysis for CTCs. Model estimates for utility inputs were obtained from previously published reports. For the base analysis, the rate of CTC-positivity was estimated to be 10%, the 5-year rate of locoregional recurrence (LRR) was assumed to be 1.5% for all scenarios, and the rate of acute (Grade ≥3) toxicity following RT was estimated to be 6.5%. Sensitivity analyses were performed utilizing a range of model inputs, including estimates for percent of patients found to be positive for CTCs, total costs, utility inputs, risk of LRR, cost of salvage therapy, and time horizon. Results: The total (direct and indirect) cost was lowest for CTC-negative women who did not require RT ($1,074) and highest for CTC-positive women who received RT ($7,202). The cost of hypofractionated WBRT was estimated to be $6,128 with a boost and $4,872 without a boost. The total cost of CTC analysis was estimated to be $1,074. The five-year QALY gain estimate was highest for CTC-negative women for whom RT was omitted (4.80) and lowest for CTC-positive women who received RT (4.49), while women who received standard of care had a 5-year QALY gain of 4.58. On incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, biomarker-directed treatment based on CTC-status was $4,441 (or $3,185) less expensive than the total cost of RT with (or without) a boost and gained 0.19 incremental QALY at the 5-year time horizon. Dominance of biomarker-directed treatment over standard of care was robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Biomarker-directed recommendation for whole-breast RT based on CTC status for women with low-risk EBC is a dominant strategy compared to standard of care given decreased cost and increased effectiveness for the majority of patients."
"Goyal, S., et al.",2010,Clinicopathologic Significance of Excision Repair Cross-Complementation 1 Expression in Patients Treated With Breast-Conserving Surgery and Radiation Therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The excision repair cross-complementation 1 (ERCC1) enzyme plays a rate-limiting role in the nucleotide excision repair pathway and is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in cancers of the head and neck and the lung. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of ERCC1 expression in a cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conservation therapy. Methods and Materials: Paraffin specimens from 504 women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy were constructed into tissue microarrays. The array was stained for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and ERCC1. This was then correlated with clinicopathologic factors and outcomes data. Results: ERCC-1 expression was evaluable in 366 cases (72%). In this group, 32% and 38% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, respectively. Increased ERCC-1 expression was found to be correlated with ER positivity (p < 0.005), lower T stage (p < 0.017), nodal negativity (p < 0.013), age >50 (p < 0.006), reduced use of adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.02), and increased use of adjuvant hormonal therapy (p < 0.004). ERCC1 expression did not correlate with locoregional recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, cause-specific survival, or overall survival. In patients who were both ERCC1-negative and -positive, the use of chemotherapy predicted for worse distant metastasis-free survival (p = 0.05 and p = 0.07, respectively) but not cause-specific survival or overall survival. Conclusions: Although ERCC1 expression did not predict for outcome measures in this dataset, overexpression correlated with favorable prognostic factors such as ER positivity, lower T stage, nodal negativity, and age >50. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating ERCC1 expression in patients receiving adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Grann, A., et al.",2000,Prone breast radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: A preliminary analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Women with large breasts have marked dose inhomogeneity and often an inferior cosmetic outcome when treated with breast conservation compared to smaller-sized patients. We designed a prone breast board, which both minimizes breast separation and irradiated lung or heart volume. We report feasibility, cosmesis, and preliminary local control and survival for selected women with Stage 0-II breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Fifty- six patients with clinical Stage 0-II breast cancer were treated with lumpectomy and breast irradiation utilizing a prototype prone breast board. A total of 59 breasts were treated. Indications for treatment in the prone position were large or pendulous breast size (n = 57), or a history of cardiopulmonary disease (n = 2). The median bra size was 41D (range, 34D- 44EE). Cosmesis was evaluated on a 1-10 (worst-to-best) scale. Results: Acute toxicity included skin erythema (80% of patients experienced Grade I or Grade II erythema), breast edema (72% of patients experienced mild edema), pruritus (20% of patients), and fatigue (20% of patients reported mild fatigue). One patient required a treatment break. The only late toxicity was related to long-term cosmesis. The mean overall cosmesis score for 53 patients was 9.37 (range, 8-10). Actuarial 3- and 5-year local control rates are 98%. Actuarial overall survival at 3 and 5 years are 98% and 94%. Conclusion: Our data indicate that treating selected women with prone breast radiotherapy is feasible and tolerated. The approach results in excellent cosmesis, and short-term outcome is comparable to traditional treatment techniques. This technique offers an innovative alternative to women who might not otherwise be considered candidates for breast conservation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc."
"Gray, J. R., et al.",1991,Primary breast irradiation in large-breasted or heavy women: Analysis of cosmetic outcome.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Treatment of early stage breast cancer with lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy is considered by many to be relatively contraindicated in heavy women or women with large or pendulous breasts. To quantitatively analyze this, we reviewed the cosmetic outcome in 257 patients. These patients were divided into ''large'' (89) and ''average'' (168) groups by one or more of the following criteria: weight ≥ 80 kg, bra size ≥ 40 in., cup size ≥ D, and tangent separation ≥ 23 cm. All patients were given cosmetic scores on a 1-10 scale by an independent observer for each of 8 cosmetic indices. These scores were analyzed at 1, 3, and 5 years follow-up (median 3 years). The average group scored higher than the large group on overall cosmesis (8.01 vs 7.34, p = 0.0004) and on 5 of 7 subindices (p = 0.0001 to 0.05) at 1 year. At 3 and 5 year follow-up only symmetry and retraction remained significantly different, favoring the average group. The largest difference noted at any point between the groups was 1.27 (retraction at 5 years, 8.54 vs 7.27, p = 0.0148). Therefore, although an inferior cosmetic result has been documented in the large group, we do not feel the magnitude of the difference mandates a change in our policy of offering all of these women breast-conserving therapy."
"Griem, K. L., et al.",2003,Three-dimensional photon dosimetry: A comparison of treatment of the intact breast in the supine and prone position.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare the adequacy of target coverage, dose homogeneity, and volume of normal tissue irradiated in treatment of the intact breast in the supine and prone position. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients with early breast cancer who presented for treatment to the intact breast after excisional biopsy were studied. A specially designed device was used for the prone setup to displace the contralateral breast away from the tangential field borders. Treatment planning computed tomography was performed for each patient in both the supine and prone positions. Dosimetric data were obtained in both positions and isodose distributions were calculated for each patient in both positions. Results: The volume of breast receiving greater than 5% of the prescribed dose was significantly less in the prone position. Medial wedges were either not used or their angles were reduced for all patients in the prone position compared with the supine position. The average volume of lung receiving >10 Gy and >20 Gy was significantly less in the prone positions. The volume of heart irradiated at critical dose levels did not vary consistently in the prone and supine positions. The integral dose delivered to the contralateral breast was not significantly different. Conclusion: Treatment of the intact breast in the prone position may result in improved dose homogeneity within the target volume as well as sparing of normal lung compared with treatment in the conventional supine position.

"Grossberg, A., et al.",2017,Prospective validation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) polymorphism C509T as a predictor of radiation-induced fibrosis in early stage breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): TGF-β plays a central role in mediating postradiation fibrosis. Prior literature posits that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TGF-β gene may account for differences in fibrosis risk, but prospective validation is lacking. The C509T polymorphism in the promotor region of the TGF-β gene is associated with increased expression and elevated circulating levels of TGF-β. We sought to prospectively validate the C509T variant allele as a predictor of breast fibrosis. Materials/Methods: Patients were recruited from a prospective randomized trial comparing two whole breast irradiation dosing schedules. The trial was prospectively designed to yield 83% power to test the hypothesis that C509T is associated with a fourfold increase in grade 2+ breast fibrosis assessed at 3 years post-radiation using the SOMA scale, assuming 150 participants and aZ0.05. Exploratory, pre-specified analyses tested the association of C509T with patient-reported cosmetic and functional outcomes assessed using the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS), cosmetic outcome graded on the RTOG scale by a threephysician panel blinded to randomization arm, and NCI CTCAEv4. Hypotheses were tested using Fisher's exact, Chi-square, or Student's t-test as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of grade 2+ breast fibrosis. Results: TGF-β genotype and 3-year follow-up were available for 174 of 287 patients enrolled in the trial, of whom 89 (51%) had at least one copy of C509T. C509T was present in 75% of Hispanics compared to 48% of whites and 35% of blacks (PZ.01), but it was not associated with other baseline covariables. The primary outcome, grade 2+ breast fibrosis, was present in 14% of patients with C509T compared to 4% of patients without it (PZ.02). In multivariable analysis, only C509T (ORZ5.2, 95% CI 1.3-20.7, PZ.02) and post-operative cosmetic outcome (ORZ7.7, 95% CI 2.5-23.4, P<.001) predicted breast fibrosis risk. The randomization arm did not predict breast fibrosis (PZ.98) and did not interact with TGF-β genotype (PZ.94). C509T was also associated with adverse patient-reported functional outcome (PZ.04), with a trend toward increased risk of moderate to large shoulder stiffness (11% vs 4%; PZ.08). C509T was also associated with greater risk of grade 2 NCI CTC breast atrophy (17% vs 7%; PZ.047). C509T was not associated with patient-reported (PZ.52) or panel-assessed (PZ.51) cosmetic Conclusion: This study prospectively validates the C509T allele of TGF-β as a key predictor of breast fibrosis risk and other adverse outcomes. TGFb genotype may be helpful for patient selection, risk stratification, and radiation mitigation strategies. outcome."
"Grosse, A., et al.",1997,Results of breast conserving therapy for early breast cancer and the role of mammographic follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The following article is a review of 23 years of breast- conserving therapy in our hospital. This study was performed to assess and improve the follow-up care of women with early breast cancer and to evaluate whether or not biannual mammogram is useful. Methods and Materials: Between 1972 and December 1995, 3072 women with pathological size pT1 and pT2 breast cancer were treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. Eighty- five patients developed a recurrence in the treated breast as the first site of failure, 12 of which had positive axillary nodes. In the following patient study, those with an noninvasive recurrence were excluded. A retrospective assessment of the entire mammographic course was made, starting with the mammogram at the time of original diagnosis to the mammogram of the recurrence. Results: In our study group the probability for local failure ranged from 1 to 2% per year. At 5 and 10 years the actuarial rates were 5 and 10%. The median time to recurrence was 41 months (range 8-161). Twenty- six (31%) recurrences were detected by mammography alone, 10 (12%) by clinical examination only, and 35 (41%) by both methods. For the patients with an ipsilateral recurrence, the overall actuarial 5- and 10-year survival after treatment was 87 and 70%, respectively. The 5-year actuarial rate of survival from salvage mastectomy was 61%. Conclusion: Considering the high percentage of recurrences detectable by mammography and the possibility of detection within a short-term interval, we think biannual mammographic follow-up is appropriate for the first years following breast-conserving therapy."
"Guerci, A., et al.",2014,Polymorphic variant TP53 (R72P) may suggest acute radiotoxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing conventional radiation treatments.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Numerous studies have suggested that individual radiosensitivity is a complex phenotype dependent on the interplay of genes related to DNA repair or enzymes involved in anti-oxidative activities. Thus, much interest lies in developing genetic analysis that predicts a patient's probability of suffering toxicity following radiation therapy. The objective of this discovery study was to evaluate the potential association between candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related response to radiation therapy injury in breast cancer patients undergoing conventional whole breast radiation. Materials/Methods: Fifty even samples in the discovery set were analyzed from patients with early stage breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiation to a total dose of 5040 cGy delivered in 180 cGy daily fractions. Whole breast radiation treatments were conducted with a linear accelerator. DNA extraction was performed from peripheral blood or buccal swab. All individuals were genotyped for SNPs in GSTP1 (I105V), NOS3 (G298A), SOD2 (V16A), and TP53 (R72P) by RFLPPCR. Univariate analysis (ORs and 95%CI) was performed to correlate SNPs with the risk of developing ≥ grade 1 acute skin reactions. Results: A significant relationship between polymorphic variant TP53 (R72P) and a risk of developing ≥ grade 1 acute skin reactions was seen (p = 0.043). There was no demonstrated association with polymorphisms of oxidative stress enzymes tested (Table). Conclusions: This discovery study suggests a significant relationship between polymorphic variant TP53 (R72P) and a risk of developing ≥ grade 1 acute skin reactions. Further verification study to interrogate clinical relevance is currently in process."
"Gustavsson, A., et al.",1999,No serious late cardiac effects after adjuvant radiotherapy following mastectomy in premenopausal women with early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess cardiac mortality, coronary artery disease, myocardial dysfunction, and valvular heart disease in women younger than 65 years of age, at least 10 years after adjuvant radiotherapy following mastectomy in early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Ninety women (45- 64 years old) with Stage II breast cancer without relapse, included in the South Sweden Breast Cancer Trial (premenopausal arm), with or without adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy ± cyclophosphamide were examined with myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography/Doppler, 10-17 years after radiotherapy. Thirty-four patients had been irradiated for left-sided tumors, 33 for right-sided tumors, and 23 patients had not been treated with radiotherapy. The radiotherapy (conventional roentgen, electron beams, and high-energy photon beams combined, in each patient) included the chest wall and the regional lymph nodes, with a specified target dose of 38-48 Gy, administered in daily fractions of 1.9-2.4 Gy, 5 days/week. Results: No cardiac deaths were found among the original 275 patients randomized to adjuvant therapy. In the 90 patients examined, abnormal findings were recorded for ECG (14 patients), exercise test (5 patients), myocardial scintigraphy (6 patients), thickening of valve cusps (14 patients), and mild valvular regurgitation (20 patients). All patients had normal systolic function. Diastolic dysfunction was observed in 6 patients (abnormal relaxation in 4 patients and restrictive filling abnormality in 2 patients). Although no significant differences were found between the 3 study groups, there was a tendency to more abnormal findings after radiotherapy. Conclusion: Women younger than 50 years of age at the time of adjuvant radiotherapy following mastectomy in early breast cancer, had no serious cardiac sequelae 13 years (median) later, despite partly old-fashioned radiation techniques."
"Guy, C. L., et al.",2019,Dynamic Modulated Brachytherapy (DMBT) Balloon Applicator for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To propose a novel high-dose-rate brachytherapy applicator for balloon-based dynamic modulated brachytherapy (DMBT) for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and to demonstrate its dosimetric advantage compared to the widely used Contura applicator. Methods and Materials: The DMBT balloon device consists of a fixed central channel enabling real-time, in vivo dosimetry and an outer motion-dynamic, adjustable-radius channel capable of moving to any angular position within the balloon. This design allows placement of dwell positions anywhere within the balloon volume, guaranteeing optimal placement and generation of the applicator and treatment plan, respectively. Thirteen clinical treatment plans for patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving APBI after lumpectomy using Contura were retrospectively obtained under institutional review board approval. New treatment plans were created by replacing the Contura with the DMBT device. DMBT plans were limited to 4 angular positions and an outer channel radius of 1.5 cm. The new plans were optimized to limit dose to ribs and skin while maintaining target coverage similar to that of the clinical plan. Results: Similar target coverage was obtained for the DMBT plans compared with clinical Contura plans. Across all patients the mean (standard deviation) reductions in D0.1 cc to the ribs and skin were 6.70% (6.28%) and 5.13% (6.54%), respectively. A threshold separation distance between the balloon surface and the organ at risk (OAR), below which dosimetric changes of greater than 5% were obtained, was observed to be 12 mm for ribs and skin. When both OARs were far from the balloon, DMBT plans were of similar quality to Contura plans, as expected. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the superior ability of the APBI DMBT applicator to spare OARs while achieving target coverage comparable to current treatment plans, especially when in close proximity. The DMBT balloon may enable new modes of dynamic high-dose-rate treatment delivery and allow for ultrahypofractionated dose regimens to be safely used."
"Gyenes, G., et al.",1996,Myocardial damage in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy: A prospective study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To look for early and late signs of cardiac side effects of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with left-sided breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Seventeen left-sided primary (Stage I-III) breast cancer patients considered eligible were recruited. Their computer tomography-based dose planning showed a part of the heart's left ventricle irradiated with at least 85-95% of the total dose. Twelve patients were examined both before treatment and an average of 13 months later, at a first follow-up. In partially mastectomized patients tangential opposed photon fields were used to the breast tissue, while in patients with modified radical mastectomy electrons were given to the thorax. Echocardiography and a bicycle ergometry stress test with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy were carried out before and after radiotherapy to assess if any myocardial damage could be detected. Results: Six of the 12 patients exhibited new fixed scintigraphic defects after radiotherapy indicating regional hypoperfusion. Four of them received treatment only to the breast after breast-conserving surgery. The localization of the defects corresponded well with the irradiated volume of the left ventricle. No deterioration in left ventricular systolic or diastolic function could be detected by echocardiography. Conclusions: In this study half of the patients exhibited new scintigraphic defects that indicate radiation-induced myocardial damage, probably affecting the microcirculation. There were no changes on electrocardiography or any deterioration of the left ventricular function at this stage. Long-term follow-up is necessary to assess whether this finding is a prognostic sign for developing radiation-induced coronary artery disease."
"Gyenes, G., et al.",1994,Morbidity of ischemic heart disease in early breast cancer 15-20 years after adjuvant radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess the cardiac side effects, primarily the occurrence of ischemic heart disease in symptom-free patients with early breast cancer treated with radiotherapy. Methods and Materials: Thirty-seven survivors of a former randomized study of early breast cancer were examined. Twenty patients irradiated pre- or postoperatively for left sided disease (study group patients) were compared with 17 controls who were either treated for right sided disease, or were nonirradiated patients. Radiotherapy was randomized in the original study; either tangential field 60Co, or electron-therapy was delivered. Echocardiography and bicycle ergometry stress test with 99mTc SestaMIBI myocardial perfusion scintigraphy were carried out and the patients' major risk factors for ischemic heart disease were also listed. Results: Our results showed a significant difference between the scintigraphic findings of the two groups. Five of the 20 study group patients (25%), while none of the 17 controls exhibited some kind of significant defects on scintigraphy, indicating ischemic heart disease (p < 0.05). No deterioration in left ventricular systolic and/or diastolic function could be detected by echocardiography. Conclusion: Radiotherapy for left sided breast cancer with the mentioned treatment technique may present as an independent risk factor in the long-term development of ischemic heart disease, while left ventricular dysfunction could not be related to the previous irradiation. We emphasize the need to optimize adjuvant radiotherapy for early breast cancer by considering the dose both to the heart as well as the cancer."
"Haas, J. A., et al.",2015,Stereotactic body radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer using a robotic linear accelerator.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Standard radiation therapy for patients with breast cancer desiring breast conservation typically consists of lumpectomy followed by radiation. Radiation can either be delivered to the whole-breast or to part of the breast. Whole-breast radiation is typically given daily for 3-6 weeks depending on the dose/fractionation scheme. When partial-breast irradiation is given, often an implanted catheter is used to deliver a conformal dose of radiation to the lumpectomy cavity in an accelerated manner over one week. In properly selected patients, the results for partial-breast irradiation appear comparable to results for conventional whole-breast radiation. We examined the safety and efficacy of using an accelerated dose/fractionation schedule with a robotic linear accelerator for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer after lumpectomy. We reported on our technique and early results. Materials/Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled on an IRB approved breast protocol. Eligibility included Stage 0/I/II (<3 cm) Age >45, margins negative. One patient had fiducial markers placed by the surgeon. The other 25 patients had fiducial markers placed by the treating radiation oncologist using image guidance on a CT simulator with coordinate placement determined by the physics/dosimetry staff for optimal location. Patients were immobilized either using a thermoplastic cast with a hole removed around the areola to allow for reproducibility daily or with an alpha cradle to allow the breast to remain in its natural position. All patients received a dose of 3,000 cGy in 5 fractions of 600 cGy each given on five consecutive days. The median number of beams was 86. The median prescription isodose line was 71%. This isodose was chosen to allow for a more rapid fall of dose beyond the target volume to more accurately emulate HDR treatment. Results: With a median follow-up of 27 months, (range, 3-48 months) all 26 patients (100%) remain locally controlled with no evidence of disease following treatment. RTOG Grade 1 dry skin desquamation occurred in 1 of 26 patients. The cosmesis was good-excellent in all 26 patients using the Harvard cosmesis scale. Conclusion: Stereotactic body radiosurgery for early-stage breast cancer using a robotic linear accelerator is very well tolerated and efficacious for selected patients desiring breast conservation after lumpectomy. More accrual and further follow-up will be required to see if these results remain durable."

We examined the safety and efficacy of using an accelerated dose/fractionation schedule with a robotic linear accelerator for select patients with early stage breast cancer after lumpectomy. Herein we report our multi-institutional results. Purpose/Objective(s): Sixty-three consecutive patients with early stage breast cancer were enrolled on an institutional review board approved protocol at two academic hospitals. Eligibility included Stage 0/I/II (< 3 cm), Age >45, negative margins. Most (41) fiducial markers were placed by the treating radiation oncologist, utilizing image guidance on a CT simulator with coordinate placement determined by the physics staff for optimal localization. The remainder was placed by the surgeon at the time of lumpectomy. Patients were immobilized either using a thermoplastic cast or with an alpha cradle to allow the breast to remain in its natural position. All patients were treated with non-isocentric robotic SBRT using real-time tracking of the implanted fiducials. The mean prescription was 3000 cGy (range: 2500-3600) delivered in 5 (range: 5-10) consecutive daily fractions. The median prescription isodose line was 71% (range: 65-76%). The mean PTV for the whole group was 114 cm3 (range 39-241 cm3). Results: With a median follow-up of 46 months, (range: 2-91), 62 of 63 patients (98.3%) remain locally controlled with no evidence of disease following treatment. One patient developed a local recurrence 18 months after radiation and was treated with mastectomy and remains without evidence of disease. Minimal erythema involving a small portion of the breast was reported by 2 patients and one patient experienced pain at the lumpectomy site 10 months post treatment. RTOG Grade 1 dry skin desquamation occurred in 1 of 63 patients. The cosmesis was good-excellent in all 62 patients using the Harvard cosmesis scale. Conclusion: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for patients with early stage breast cancer desiring breast conservation therapy can be delivered safely with a robotic linear accelerator. Treatment is well tolerated and efficacious for well selected patients in this multi-institutional cohort. More accrual and longer duration of follow-up will be required to see if these results remain durable."
"Habibollahi, F., et al.",1988,Assessment of skin dose and its relation to cosmesis in the conservative treatment of early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"A conservation technique has been developed for the treatment of early breast cancer which involved removal of the tumor, axillary clearance, tumor site implantation with Iridium-192 wires for a boost dose and subsequent treatment of the breast with radical megavoltage external beam therapy. Although the cosmetic results were satisfactory in the majority of the patients, for some it was rated as fair or poor. One variable factor which could have carried some morbidity was the dose of radiation received by the skin. In 51 patients, doses were measured at several points over the treated breast using Thermoluminescent Dosimetry (LTD) at the time of the iridium implant and during the subsequent external beam therapy. Development of skin pigmentation, oedema, and fibrosis were unrelated to the dose received by the skin but the findings suggested that doses greater than 50 Gy to the skin increased the possibility of late (>24 months) telangiectasia over the boosted area. Treatment of tumors in the lower half of the breast, or in large breasts, was associated with a higher incidence of poor cosmesis. This may have been the result of varying posture on the interstitial dose distribution from the Iridium-192 wires and comparison of dose distribution in both supine and erect positions was carried out."
"Hafeez, F., et al.",2013,Is Ki-67 expression prognostic for local relapse in early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT)?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Ki-67 is a human nuclear protein whose expression is strongly up-regulated in proliferating cells and can be used to determine the growth fraction in clonal cell populations. Although there are some data to suggest that Ki-67 overexpression may be prognostic for endpoints such as survival or postmastectomy recurrence, further elucidation of its prognostic significance is warranted. Specifically after breast conservation therapy (BCT) (defined in this setting as breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy), whether Ki-67 predicts for locoregional recurrence has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to assess Ki-67 expression in a cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients to determine whether a significant independent association between Ki-67 and locoregional relapse exists. Methods and Materials Ki-67 staining was conducted on a tissue microarray of 438 patients previously treated with BCT, and expression was analyzed with clinicopathologic features and outcomes from our database. Results Ki-67 expression was more prevalent in black patients (37% of black patients vs 17% of white patients, P<.01), younger patients (27% of patients aged ≤50 years vs 15% of patients aged >50 years, P<.01), estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors (25% of ER-negative tumors vs 17% of ER-positive tumors, P=.04), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu-positive tumors (35% of HER2-positive tumors vs 18% of HER2-negative tumors, P=.01), and larger tumors (26% of T2 tumors vs 16% of T1 tumors, P=.03). On univariate/multivariate analysis, Ki-67 did not predict for overall survival (74.4% vs 72.6%), cause-specific survival (82.9% vs 82.1%), local relapse-free survival (83.6% vs 88.5%), distant metastasis-free survival (76.1% vs 81.4%), recurrence-free survival (65.5% vs 74.6%), and locoregional recurrence-free survival (81.6% vs 84.7%): P>.05 for all. Conclusions Ki-67 appears to be a surrogate marker for aggressive disease and significantly correlates with known prognostic features such as age, race, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status but independently does not predict for locoregional outcomes after BCT when these other prognostic clinicopathologic features are taken into consideration. The independent associations of Ki-67 with race and age appear to be novel to our study.  Inc."
"Haffty, B. G., et al.",1990,Regional nodal irradiation in the conservative treatment of breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"At this institution conservative treatment of breast cancer was begun in the 1960's. The following analysis represents our experience through 1984 with specific reference to the management of the regional lymph nodes. A total of 432 patients with clinical stage I and II breast cancer were treated between 1962 and 1984 with lumpectomy and radiation therapy. The breast was treated with tangential fields to a median of 4800 cGy and electron conedown to a total tumor bed dose of 6400 cGy. Axillary dissection was not routinely performed, particularly in the earlier years. More recently, axillary dissection has been used with increasing frequency if it was felt that the results of the dissection would influence systemic treatment. One hundred eighty-seven patients (43%) underwent axillary dissection (30% pathologically positive) and routinely received regional nodal irradiation (median dose 4600 cGy) to the internal mammary and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Two hundred forty-five patients (57%) did not undergo axillary dissection and routinely received regional nodal irradiation to the internal mammary, supraclavicular, and entire axillary regions to a total median dose of 4600 cGy. As of May 1989 with a median follow-up of 7.5 years, there have been a total of 12 nodal failures for an actuarial nodal control rate of 97% at 5 years and 96% at 10 years. The actuarial 5-year regional nodal control rate was the same for both the group of patients receiving regional RT alone without axillary dissection and the group of patients receiving axillary dissection and supraclavicular/internal mammary radiation. There has been minimal morbidity associated with this treatment policy. We conclude that regional nodal irradiation as described above, with or without axillary dissection, results in a high rate of regional nodal control and minimal treatment morbidity in patients undergoing conservative treatment of early stage breast cancer."
"Haffty, B. G., et al.",2008,Timing of Chemotherapy After MammoSite Radiation Therapy System Breast Brachytherapy: Analysis of the American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite Breast Brachytherapy Registry Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate cosmetic outcome and radiation recall in the American Society of Breast Surgeons registry trial, as a function of the interval between accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and initiation of chemotherapy (CTX). Methods and Materials: A total of 1440 patients at 97 institutions participated in this trial. After lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer, patients received APBI (34 Gy in 10 fractions) with MammoSite RTS brachytherapy. A total of 148 patients received CTX within 90 days of APBI. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated at each follow-up visit and dichotomized as excellent/good or fair/poor. Results: Chemotherapy was initiated at a mean of 3.9 weeks after the final MammoSite procedure and was administered ≤3 weeks after APBI in 54 patients (36%) and >3 weeks after APBI in 94 patients (64%). The early and delayed groups were well balanced with respect to multiple factors that may impact on cosmetic outcome. There was a superior cosmetic outcome in those receiving chemotherapy >3 weeks after APBI (excellent/good in 72.2% at ≤3 weeks vs. excellent/good in 93.8% at >3 weeks; p = 0.01). Radiation recall in those receiving CTX at ≤3 weeks was 9 of 50 (18%), compared with 6 of 81(7.4%) in those receiving chemotherapy at >3 weeks (p = 0.09). Conclusion: The majority of patients receiving CTX after APBI have excellent/good cosmetic outcomes, with a low rate of radiation recall. Chemotherapy initiated >3 weeks after the final MammoSite procedure seems to be associated with a better cosmetic outcome and lower rate of radiation recall. An excellent/good cosmetic outcome in patients receiving CTX after 3 weeks was similar to the cosmetic outcome of the overall patient population who did not receive CTX.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Haffty, B. G., et al.",1995,Subareolar breast cancer: Long-term results with conservative surgery and radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: It has been suggested that patients presenting with breast cancers within 2 cm of the nipple areolar complex represent a relative contraindication to conservative management due to either a compromised cosmetic result associated with sacrifice of the nipple areolar complex, reluctance to include the entire nipple areolar complex in the conedown field, or increased risk of multicentricity. We have reviewed our experience of conservatively treated patients with specific reference to the subset of patients presenting with tumors within 2 cm of the nipple areolar complex. Methods and Materials: Between January 1970 and December 1989, 1014 patients with early stage breast cancer were treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital by excisional biopsy with or without axillary lymph node dissection. Of the 1014 charts reviewed, a total of 98 patients fulfilled the criteria of having a central/subareolar breast cancer. Reexcision was performed on only 16 patients. Following conservative surgery, patients were treated with radiation therapy to the intact breast to a total median dose of 48 Gy with conedown to a total of 64 Gy. Adjuvant systemic therapy and regional nodal irradiation were administered as clinically indicated. Results: As of December 1993, the median follow-up for the 98 patients in this study was 9.03 years. The majority of patients had presented with either a palpable mass or a mammographically detected lesion. Three patients presented with Paget's disease, five with nipple discharge, and seven with nipple inversion. Ten of the 98 patients had the nipple areolar complex sacrificed at the time of surgery, while the remaining 88 patients had the entire nipple areolar complex included in the conedown field. Four of these 88 patients had the nipple partially blocked during the electron conedown. There were no significant complications associated with including the entire nipple areolar complex within the conedown field to a median dose of 64 Gy. Six of the 98 patients experienced a local recurrence, three experienced a regional recurrence, and nine experienced distant metastasis. The actuarial 10-year survival (0.79 ± 0.06), distant disease-free survival (0.88 ± 0.04) and breast recurrence-free survival (0.84 ± 0.07) were not significantly different from those patients who presented with cancers in other parts of the breast. Conclusions: Patients presenting with subareolar breast cancers within 2 cm of the nipple areolar complex are suitable candidates for conservative surgery and radiation therapy. In the majority of patients in this study, the nipple areolar complex did not need to be sacrificed and could be safely included in the electron conedown field with acceptable complications and cosmesis. A subareolar breast cancer does not represent a relative contraindication to conservative management in patients with early stage breast cancer."

"Hallahan, D. E., et al.",1989,Breast conserving surgery and definitive irradiation for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Breast conserving surgery and postoperative breast radiotherapy were used to treat 219 cases of AJCC Stage I and II breast carcinoma at the Michael Reese and University of Chicago Hospitals. Most patients were treated with lumpectomy and axillary sampling followed by breast irradiation to a dose of 46 Gy followed by a boost dose of 14-16 Gy to the surgical bed. The 5-year actuarial local control is 92%. Follow-up is 1 to 10 years and the median follow-up is 36 months. Of the seven patients who recurred in the breast, three failed in the boost site and three failed adjacent to the boost site. The seventh patient recurred diffusely in the breast and skin. Four of the seven recurrences were in patients with positive surgical margins. The 5-year actuarial relapse-free survival is 80%. Factors which had an adverse affect on the cosmetic results were a scar length greater than 8 cm and a volume of resected breast tissue greater than 100 cm3. Treatment related complications were minor and infrequent. Breast conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy is effective in achieving local control with good to excellent cosmetic results."
"Hallman, M. A., et al.",2011,HER-2/neu overexpression and tumor subtyping: Is there an increased risk of axillary node positivity in early stage breast cancer?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Based upon ACOSOG Z0011, women with T1-2 tumors and 1 or 2 positive sentinel nodes (SN) are less likely to undergo completion axillary dissection. This creates uncertainty for radiation field selection because traditional indications for supraclavicular irradiation are ≥4 positive nodes. Nomograms have been reported to predict positive nonsentinel nodes but do not include HER2 overexpression. It is known that HER2 positive (HER2+) tumors are more biologically aggressive but whether this impacts on the risk of regional node involvement is unknown. This study was conducted to determine the risk of regional node metastases in women with HER2+ breast cancer compared to a HER2- control population. Materials/Methods: Two hundred seventy women with HER2+ T1 or T2 tumors treated with breast conservation were identified from a prospective IRB-approved database. 535 HER2- women from the same database were individually matched as a control cohort by tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, histology, estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor location and age. Endpoints were incidence of pathologic positive nodes, positive sentinel nodes, positive nonsentinel nodes, ≥4 total positive axillary nodes, and nodal recurrences. Results: Five hundred eighty were node-positive (N+) and 225 were node-negative (N0). 27.8% of HER2+ women and 28.0% of HER2- women were node positive (p = 0.94), and 4.1% and 4.9% had ≥4 positive nodes, respectively (p = 0.88). Of women undergoing sentinel node biopsy, 24% of HER2+ and 24% of HER2- were positive. There were no significant differences in mean or median positive nodes. Nodal recurrences were few and occurred in 2 (0.7%) HER2+ and 4 (0.7%) HER2- women. The nodal positivity and mean positive sentinel and nonsentinel nodes were then reexamined by dividing patients into 4 tissue subgroups. (Table presented) Conclusions: Overexpression of HER2 alone did not significantly increase the risk of nodal metastases. However, ER and PR - and HER2+ tumors had a nonsignificant trend to more nonsentinel nodes positive and significantly higher risk of ≥4 positive nodes. Sentinel node positive patients with this receptor expression pattern may elect to proceed with adjuvant therapy without completion axillary dissection according to ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. These women may need more careful consideration for regional nodal irradiation because of this higher risk of more extensive axillary involvement."
"Hallman, M. A., et al.",2012,Impact of regional nodal irradiation on outcomes of breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive axillary nodes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Routine regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for patients with early stage breast cancer and 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes (LN) is controversial. For patients with 1-3 positive nodes, comprehensive RNI has typically been reserved for patients who are at greater risk of recurrence. We report our long-term outcomes for women with 1-3 positive LN treated with breast radiation +/- RNI. Materials/Methods: Women with 1-3 positive LN treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation (RT) were identified from a prospective database. Women with inflammatory breast cancer; positive margins; <1 year follow-up; treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, internal mammary node RT, or an incomplete course of RT were excluded. Patients were stratified by RT to the breast vs. breast + supraclavicular fossa (SCLAV) vs. comprehensive RNI (breast + SCLAV + posterior axillary boost [PAB]). Site of failure, disease free survival (DFS), breast cancer-specific (BCSS), overall survival (OS), and lymphedema rates were evaluated. Results: Five hundred forty-two patients were identified with median follow-up of 7.5 years. Three hundred fifty-nine (66.2%), 109 (20.1%) and 74 (13.7%) patients had RT to the breast alone, breast + SCLAV, and comprehensive RNI, respectively. Compared to breast RT only, higher T stage, ≥2 positive LN and unknown hormone receptor status, HER2/neu status, extracapsular extension (ECE), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and tumor grade were more common in women with breast + SCLAV RT (p < 0.05.) Compared to breast + SCLV RT, ≥2 positive LN and unknown HER2/neu, extensive intraductal component, ECE, and LVI were more common with comprehensive RNI (p < 0.05). There were 8 (1.5%) any regional failures. The rates of regional and local/regional failure were not statistically different among the groups. At 5 years, distant failures were more common in the comprehensive RNI group (19.6%) vs. breast only (9.0%) and breast + SCLAV (9.9%) groups (p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the comprehensive RNI group remained at greater risk for any distant failure (HR 1.74, p = 0.049); T2 vs. T1 (HR 1.98, p = 0.004) also remained significantly associated with increased distant failure. BCSS was lower in the comprehensive RNI group (85.7%) vs. breast only (94.5%) and breast +SCLAV (93.1%) groups (p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis comprehensive RNI was not significantly associated with BCSS (p = 0.06). DFS and OS were not different among the groups. The number of LN dissected was similar in all groups; however, lymphedema rates were higher among the breast + SCLAV (24.8%) and comprehensive RNI (28.4%) groups vs breast only group (15.6%, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Locoregional control, DFS, BCSS, and OS were excellent in women with 1-3 positive LN, despite differences in RNI. Lymphedema rates were higher following RNI. Thus, RNI should be considered only when there is known potential benefit."
"Hamilton, S., et al.",2014,Second malignancies after adjuvant radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer: Is there an increased risk with the addition of regional radiotherapy?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To determine if there is an increased risk of second malignancies (SM), particularly lung cancer, in early stage breast cancer patients (pts) treated with the addition of nodal fields to breast/chest wall radiotherapy (RT). Materials/Methods: Subjects were Stage I/II female breast cancer pts age 20-79 years (yrs) diagnosed from 1989-2005 and treated with adjuvant RT at our institution. Pts were included if they survived > 3 yrs after diagnosis and did not have a SM within 3 yrs of diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare SM incidence to the cancer incidence in the general age-matched population. SM risks in pts treated with local RT (LRT) to the breast/chest wall were compared to pts treated with locoregional RT (LRRT) to the breast/chest wall and regional nodes using multivariable regression analysis (MVA) to adjust for age, stage, laterality, grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, type of surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, year of diagnosis, and relapse. Results: The cohort includes 12,836 pts with a median follow-up of 8.4 yrs and 4789 pts at risk beyond 10 yrs. LRRT was used in 18% of pts. Pts receiving LRRT were younger (median age 52 vs 57 yrs) and had higher risk cancer with more Stage II (98% vs 31%), Grade 3 (43% vs 28%) and ER negative (24% vs 18%) disease (all p < 0.0001). Pts treated with LRRT had higher rates of mastectomy (46% vs 3%), chemotherapy (78% vs 26%), hormone therapy (68% vs 50%) and relapse (17% vs 13%, all p < 0.0001). Overall, 1119 pts (8.7 %) developed a SM. The SIR comparing pts treated with LRT to the general population was 1.29 (CI = 1.21-1.38). Excluding second breast cancers, the SIR was 1.10 (CI = 1.01-1.19). SIRs were elevated for breast (SIR = 1.84, CI = 1.66-2.04), uterine (SIR = 1.63, CI = 1.27-2.07) and ovarian cancer (SIR = 1.87, CI = 1.36-2.51). The lung cancer SIR was 1.06 (CI = 0.88-1.26). The SIR comparing pts treated with LRRT to the general population was 1.39 (CI = 1.17-1.64). Excluding second breast cancers, the SIR was 1.36 (CI = 1.11-1.66). SIRs were elevated for breast (SIR = 1.46, CI = 1.05- 1.98) and uterine cancer (SIR = 2.13, CI = 1.13-3.64). The lung cancer SIR was 1.27 (CI = 0.76-1.98). On MVA comparing the LRRT group to the LRT group, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.96 (CI =0.75-1.22) for all SMs and 1.09 (CI = 0.87-1.38) for all non-breast SMs. On exploratory analysis of a priori age groups, a trend towards increased non-breast SM in LRRT pts was observed in the 40-64 yr cohort (HR = 1.4, CI = 0.96-2.04). The HR for lung cancer in this cohort was 1.38 (CI = 0.59-3.23). Conclusions: No statistically significant increased SM risk was observed with the addition of regional RT to local RT in this cohort of Stage I/II breast cancer pts. On exploratory analysis, there was a trend towards an increased risk in pts age 40-64 yrs that requires further investigation. The analysis is limited by a modest number of pts with long-term follow-up."
"Hamilton, S. N., et al.",2015,Second malignancies after adjuvant radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: Is there increased risk with addition of regional radiation to local radiation?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose This study was undertaken to determine whether there was an increased risk of second malignancies (SM), particularly lung cancer, in early stage breast cancer patients treated with the addition of nodal fields to breast and/or chest wall radiation therapy (RT). Materials and Methods Subjects were stage I/II female breast cancer patients 20 to 79 years of age, diagnosed between 1989 and 2005 and treated with adjuvant RT at our institution. Patients were included if they survived and did not have SM within 3 years of diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare SM incidence to cancer incidence in the general sex- and age-matched populations. Secondary malignancy risks in patients treated with local RT (LRT) to the breast/chest wall were compared to those in patients treated with locoregional RT (LRRT) to the breast/chest wall and regional nodes, using multivariate regression analysis (MVA) to account for covariates. Results The cohort included 12,836 patients with a median follow-up of 8.4 years. LRRT was used in 18% of patients. The SIR comparing patients treated with LRT to the general population was 1.29 (CI: 1.21-1.38). No statistically significant increased incidence of in-field malignancies (SIR, 1.04; CI: 0.87-1.23) and lung cancers (SIR, 1.06; CI: 0.88-1.26) was detected. The SIR comparing patients treated with LRRT to the general population was 1.39 (CI: 1.17-1.64). No statistically significant increased incidence of in-field malignancies (SIR, 1.26; CI: 0.77-1.94) and lung cancers (SIR, 1.27; CI: 0.76-1.98) was detected. On MVA comparing LRRT to LRT, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.20 for in-field malignancies (CI: 0.68-2.16) and 1.26 for lung cancer (CI: 0.67-2.36). The excess attributable risk (EAR) to regional RT was 3.1 per 10,000 person years (CI: -8.7 to 9.9). Conclusions No statistically significant increased risk of second malignancy was detected after LRRT relative to that for LRT. The upper limit of the EAR was approximately 1% at 10 years."
"Hansen, T. M., et al.",2015,"Dosimetric comparison of treatment techniques: Brachytherapy, IMRT, and proton beam in partial-breast irradiation.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To perform a dosimetric comparison of three accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques: catheter based brachytherapy (BT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and proton beam therapy (PBT). Materials/Methods: Twelve patients with early stage left breast cancer treated with APBI using the SAVI (Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant) device at our institution from December 2012 to October 2014 were randomly selected for this study. Separate optimum plans using IMRT and PBT for each patient were created. The original BT plan and the new IMRT and PBT plans were compared using the dosimetric parameters for target and Organs at risk (OAR). Results: PBT and IMRT resulted in a significantly reduced maximum dose to the ipsilateral breast (mean 108.58% vs. 107.78% vs. 2194.43%, p=0.001 for both) and a reduced mean dose to the heart (mean 0% vs. 1.38% vs. 3.85%, p<0.001 and p=0.026) and chest wall (mean 10.07% vs. 14.65% vs. 29.44%, p=0.001 and 0.013) compared to BT. The PBT was superior in reducing the mean ipsilateral lung dose (mean 0.04% vs. 2.13% vs. 5.4%, p=0.025 and p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the maximum dose to the ipsilateral lung, chest wall, or 3 mm skin rind or in the mean ipsilateral breast V50 among the 3 techniques (p=0.168 0.405, 0.067 and 0.780, respectively). However, PBT exhibited the greatest dose homogeneity (mean homogeneity index of 4.75 vs. 7.18 for IMRT vs. 195.82 for BT, p=0.001 and p<0.001). All techniques resulted in similar dose conformality (p=0.143). Conclusion: This study confirms the dosimetric feasibility of PBT and IMRT to lower dose to OAR while still maintaining high target dose conformality. Though the results of this comparison are promising, continued clinical research is needed to better define the role of PBT and IMRT in the APBI treatment of early stage breast cancer."
"Harandi, N., et al.",2019,Early Efficacy and Cosmetic Outcomes of External-Beam Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation (APBI) Utilizing 6 Gy x 5 fractions.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): While a growing amount of data has supported the use of accelerated-partial breast irradiation (APBI) in lower risk early-stage breast cancer, the optimal approach in terms of fractionation and modality is still unknown, especially with respect to cosmetic outcomes. We sought to investigate early oncologic and cosmetic outcomes of an external-beam APBI approach of 6 Gy x 5 fractions, and assess the impact of RT modality on cosmetic outcomes. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed characteristics and outcomes of patients with breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant external-beam APBI of 6 Gy x 5 nonconsecutive fractions at our institution between 2016 and 2018 with at least 6 months of follow-up. Generally, patients were selected using ASTRO consensus guidelines. PTV volumes included 2 cm margins on lumpectomy cavity and clips when present, limited at skin and chest wall. Either IMRT or 3DCRT planning was utilized, dependent on physician and insurance coverage. Patient self-rated cosmetic outcomes were collected utilizing the 4-point Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale. Radiation modality and other factors potentially associated with cosmetic outcome were assessed using binary logistic regression. Results: There were 73 patients meeting eligibility criteria with at least 6 months follow-up. Of these, 91% were age>50 years, 80% were invasive carcinoma (20% DCIS), 94% ER positive, 85% PR positive, 1% HER2 positive, 89% Grade 1-2. Mean tumor size was 13 mm (range 2-39 mm), 6% had close margins, and endocrine therapy was used by 66% of patients. RT modality was 40% IMRT and 60% 3DCRT. Mean PTV volume was 198.4 cc (range 32.8-486.1 cc) and mean Dmax was 111% (range 103-119%). With a median follow-up of 17 months (range 6.4-31.5), local control, and disease-free survival was 100%. Cosmetic outcome was excellent/good in 89% (60% excellent, 29% good) and fair/poor in 11% (10% fair, 1% poor). Rates of excellent/good cosmesis were 96.6% for IMRT patients vs 84.1% for 3DCRT patients. All but one patient (98.6%) responded that they would choose to undergo the same APBI regimen again. In the logistic regression, radiation modality was a significant independent predictor of cosmetic outcome (p=.018), whereas all other covariates including age, PTV volume, Dmax(%), and follow-up interval had no significant association. Compared to IMRT, 3DCRT was associated with a change in the excellent/good cosmesis log odds by 0.21, after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusion: In our series, external-beam APBI resulted in high early tumor control and rates of patient-reported excellent/good cosmetic outcome. APBI using IMRT was independently associated with superior cosmetic outcome compared to 3DCRT."
"Harbeck, N. and M. Gnant",2017,Breast cancer.,The Lancet,"Breast cancer is one of the three most common cancers worldwide. Early breast cancer is considered potentially curable. Therapy has progressed substantially over the past years with a reduction in therapy intensity, both for locoregional and systemic therapy; avoiding overtreatment but also undertreatment has become a major focus. Therapy concepts follow a curative intent and need to be decided in a multidisciplinary setting, taking molecular subtype and locoregional tumour load into account. Primary conventional surgery is not the optimal choice for all patients any more. In triple-negative and HER2-positive early breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy has become a commonly used option. Depending on clinical tumour subtype, therapeutic backbones include endocrine therapy, anti-HER2 targeting, and chemotherapy. In metastatic breast cancer, therapy goals are prolongation of survival and maintaining quality of life. Advances in endocrine therapies and combinations, as well as targeting of HER2, and the promise of newer targeted therapies make the prospect of long-term disease control in metastatic breast cancer an increasing reality."
"Hardee, M. E., et al.",2012,Prone hypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy without a boost to the tumor bed: Comparable toxicity of IMRT versus a 3D conformal technique.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We report a comparison of the dosimetry and toxicity of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) vs. intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) among patients treated in the prone position with the same fractionation and target of the hypofractionation arm of the Canadian/Whelan trial. Methods and Materials: An institutional review board-approved protocol identified a consecutive series of early-stage breast cancer patients treated according to the Canadian hypofractionation regimen but in the prone position. Patients underwent IMRT treatment planning and treatment if the insurance carrier approved reimbursement for IMRT; in case of refusal, a 3D-CRT plan was used. A comparison of the dosimetric and toxicity outcomes during the acute, subacute, and long-term follow-up of the two treatment groups is reported. Results: We included 97 consecutive patients with 100 treatment plans in this study (3 patients with bilateral breast cancer); 40 patients were treated with 3D-CRT and 57 with IMRT. IMRT significantly reduced the maximum dose (Dmax median, 109.96% for 3D-CRT vs. 107.28% for IMRT; p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon test) and improved median dose homogeneity (median, 1.15 for 3D-CRT vs. 1.05 for IMRT; p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon test) when compared with 3D-CRT. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis and occurred in 92% of patients. Grade 2 dermatitis occurred in 13% of patients in the 3D-CRT group and 2% in the IMRT group. IMRT moderately decreased rates of acute pruritus (p = 0.03, chi-square test) and Grade 2 to 3 subacute hyperpigmentation (p = 0.01, Fisher exact test). With a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, the treatment was similarly well tolerated in either group, including among women with large breast volumes. Conclusion: Hypofractionated breast radiotherapy is well tolerated when treating patients in the prone position, even among those with large breast volumes. Breast IMRT significantly improves dosimetry but yields only a modest but confirmed benefit in terms of toxicities. If a concurrent boost to the tumor bed is not required, a conformal 3D-CRT approach can adequately deliver prone whole-breast hypofractionation radiotherapy.  Inc."
"Hardenbergh, P. H., et al.",1999,Treatment-related toxicity from a randomized trial of the sequencing of doxorubicin and radiation therapy in patients treated for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: There is concern that breast cancer patients treated with left- sided radiation therapy (XRT) and doxorubicin (DOX) may have an increased risk of cardiac toxicity. In addition, the effect of different sequencing of XRT and chemotherapy (CT) on the likelihood of cardiotoxicity, as well as cellulitis, arm edema, or brachial plexopathy, is not well understood. We reviewed the records of patients treated on a randomized trial testing the sequencing of CT and XRT to determine if there was an increase in cardiac events or other complications in patients treated with a total dose of DOX of 180 mg/m2 and XRT, comparing patients with treatment to the left breast and the right breast, and comparing patients treated with initial CT and initial RT. Materials and Methods: From June 1984 to December 1992, 244 patients with clinical stage I or II breast cancer were randomized following conservative surgery to receive CT (4 cycles of CAMFP at 3 week intervals) either before or after XRT (45 Gy to the entire breast, followed by a boost of 16 Gy; nodal radiation therapy was optional). Two hundred thirty-one patients were evaluable for the development of cardiac toxicity. The median age at diagnosis was 45 years (range, 20-68). CT doses were: doxorubicin, 45 mg/m2 IV bolus, d 3; methotrexate, 200 mg/m2 IV, d 1 and 15; 5-fluorouracil, 500 mg/m2 IV, d 1; cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2 IV, d 1; prednisone 40 mg p,o., d 1-5. A cardiac event was defined as a myocardial infarction or clinical evidence of congestive heart failure. Median follow-up time was 53 months. Results: No cardiac events were observed for patients with either left- or right-sided breast cancer. The sequencing of CT and XRT had no significant effect on the risk of cardiac toxicity, cellulitis, arm edema or brachial plexopathy. Conclusions: We observed no evidence of an increased risk of cardiac toxicity from the addition of left breast tangential irradiation to DOX at a total dose of 180 mg/m2. Additional follow-up is needed to exclude possible late events. In addition, the sequencing of CT and XRT does not appear to affect the risk of cellulitis, arm edema, or brachial plexopathy."
"Hardy, S., et al.",2010,Dosimetric comparison of simultaneous integrated boost vs. sequential boost in patients with early stage Breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation are often treated with simultaneously integrated boosts (SIB) instead of sequential boosts (SqB) to the lumpectomy bed. This abstract reports a dosimetric comparison of these 2 techniques in 15 patients. Materials/Methods: Actual plans of 15 patients treated for early stage breast cancer with an SIB technique were retrospectively reviewed and compared to trials created using a SqB technique. 8 left and 7 right sided cases with breast sizes of small, medium and large (5 each; small<20cm; medium 20-23cm, large . 23cm posterior chestwall separation) and various lumpectomy bed locations within the breast were selected. For the SIB technique an additional 1 or 2 photon fields was used to treat the lumpectomy bed. For the SqB technique, 1 electron beam was used in 14 of the 15 patients for the boost treatment and 1 patient received a photon boost due to the depth of the tumor bed. 10 patients were treated using an SIB dose fractionation of 50 Gy to the whole breast (WB) and 55 Gy to the lumpectomy bed (LB) in 25 fractions, 3 with 46.8 Gy to the WB and 55.9 Gy to the LB, 1 with 50.4 Gy to the WB and 58.8 Gy to the LB in 28 fractions, and 1 with 50.4 Gy to the WBand 60.2 Gy to the LB in 28 fractions. The corresponding SqB trial comparison fractionations were 50 Gy in 25 fractions to theWBfollowed by 10 Gy in 5 fractions to the LB, 46.8 Gy to theWB followed by 14 Gy in 7 fractions to the LB and 50.4 Gy to theWBfollowed by 14 Gy to the LB. Contralateral breast, ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart organs at risk (OARs) were contoured for each patient following RTOG 0413 methodology. Dosimetric evaluation of the OARs for the 2 techniques include: contralateral breast (Dmax, D5), ipsilateral lung (V20, V10, V5), contralateral lung (Dmax, D5), and heart (D5, V10, V5). Results: The median dosimetric OAR comparisons for SIB vs. SqB are as follows: contralateral breast (Dmax: 307 cGy vs. 304 cGy; D5: 95 cGy vs. 58 cGy); ipsilateral lung (V20: 4.9% vs. 5.0%; V10: 9.6% vs. 9.4%; V5: 17.0% vs.16.5%); contralateral lung (Dmax: 268 cGy vs. 130 cGy; D5: 119 cGy vs. 43 cGy); heart-left breast(D5: 355 cGy vs. 358 cGy; V10: 0.6% vs. 0.5%; V5: 2.1% vs. 2.5%) and heart-right breast (D5: 174 cGy vs. 96 cGy; V10: 0.0% vs. 0.0%; V5: 0.0% vs. 0.0%). Conclusions: SIB technique for early stage breast cancer is a viable alternative to a SqB without clinically significant dosimetric differences to the contralateral breast, ipsilateral and contralateral lung or heart. Location of the tumor bed and patient specific variables need to be considered when selecting beam orientation, treatment technique and dose fractionation."
"Haro, S., et al.",2010,Interstitial High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy for Breast Cancer in Women < 50 Years of Age Compared to . 50 Years of Age: A Report of 264 Cases using Multi-catheter Technique.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The American College of Radiology does not have an age limit for breast conservation candidacy. Recent data indicates that Interstitial Implant and High Dose Rate (HDR) radiation afterloading compares very favorably to EBRT in early stage breast cancer. There is controversy regarding the use of HDR in patients < 50 years of age. We present our data in patients < 50 years of age compared to . 50 years of age. Materials/Methods: Patients with Tis, T1, and T2 tumors measuring < 4 cm, negative surgical margins, and 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes were judged to be candidates for Interstitial Implant. Implants were performed under Stereotactic Mammographic guidance with conscious sedation and local anesthesia. The implants were placed with a custom designed template using from 3 to 8 planes, and 8 to 74 needles. Catheters were subsequently threaded thru the needles, and the needles removed. Catheter spacing was 1.0 to 1.5 cm. Radiation Treatment planning was performed using CT Scanning and the Plato System. Treatment volumes ranged from 25 cm3 to 359 cm3. HDR treatment was given using the Nucletron afterloading system. The breast implant volume received 3400 cGy in 10 fractions prescribed to the Planning Target Volume, given BID over 5 days. Results: Between 2000 and 2010, 268 patients underwent Interstitial HDR Implant. The procedure was well tolerated. No patient required hospital admission. With a median follow-up 72 months (range, 6-128 months), local recurrence (LR) occurred in 3.7% (10/268). Cosmetic results were good to excellent in 89.5% (240/268) of the patients. LR occurred in 6.3% (2/32) of patients < 50 years of age vs. 3.4% (8/236) in patients >50 years of age (p = 0.34). There were no infections. Wound healing complications developed in 3.0% (8/268). Three of these patients had received anthracycline based Chemotherapy. The other five had large (>200 cm3) implant volumes, catheter spacing of 1.5 cm, and V-150% of >30%. Two patients healed after 6 months of conservative treatment. Surgery was required in six patients who developed fat necrosis. Conclusions: With median 72 month follow-up, Breast Conservation radiation therapy utilizing Interstitial Multi-Catheter HDR Implant has yielded local recurrence rates and cosmetic results which compare favorably to EBRT in selected patients. There was no statistically significant difference in LR between patients < 50 years of age vs. >50 years of age. While there was a trend towards higher LR in patients < 50 years, LR appears comparable to patients treated with EBRT. Therefore, we believe that age < 50 years should not be a contraindication for HDR for breast conservation."
"Harris, E. E. R., et al.",2008,The Impact of Comorbidities on Outcomes for Elderly Women Treated With Breast-Conservation Treatment for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Breast cancer incidence increases with age and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly women, but is not well studied in this population. Comorbidities often impact on the management of breast cancer in elderly women. Methods and Materials: From 1979 to 2002, a total of 238 women aged 70 years and older with Stage I or II invasive carcinoma of the breast underwent breast-conservation therapy. Outcomes were compared by age groups and comorbidities. Median age at presentation was 74 years (range, 70-89 years). Age distribution was 122 women (51%) aged 70-74 years, 71 women (30%) aged 75-79 years, and 45 women (19%) aged 80 years or older. Median follow-up was 6.2 years. Results: On outcomes analysis by age groups, 10-year cause-specific survival rates for women aged 70-74, 75-79, and 80 years or older were 74%, 81%, and 82%, respectively (p = 0.87). Intercurrent deaths at 10 years were significantly higher in older patients: 20% in those aged 70-74 years, 36% in those aged 75-79 years, and 53% in those 80 years and older (p = 0.0005). Comorbidities were not significantly more common in the older age groups and did not correlate with cause-specific survival adjusted for age. Higher comorbidity scores were associated with intercurrent death. Conclusions: Older age itself is not a contraindication to standard breast-conservation therapy, including irradiation. Women of any age with low to moderate comorbidity indices should be offered standard breast-conservation treatment if otherwise clinically eligible.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Harris, J. R., et al.",1981,Primary radiation therapy for early breast cancer: The experience at the joint center for radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The results of primary radiation therapy in 176 consecutive patients with clinical Stage I and II carcinoma of the breast were reviewed. Median follow-up time was 47 months. The overall breast relapse rate was 7%. Patients undergoing interstitial implantation had a significantly lower breast relapse rate (1%) than patients not undergoing implantation (11%). Breast relapse was more common in patients undergoing incisional or needle biopsy (17%), compared to patients treated after excisional biopsy (5%). In patients undergoing excisional biopsy, but not interstitial implantation, breast relapse was related to external beam dose. Twelve percent of the patients who received less than 1600 ret dose relapsed in the breast, compared to none of the 19 patients who received more than 1700 ret dose. These results imply that supplemental irradiation to the primary tumor area is required following excisional biopsy of a primary breast cancer when 4500-5000 rad is delivered to the entire breast."

A., et al.",2011,Accelerated partial breast irradiation with low dose rate (LDR) interstitial implant brachytherapy (APBI-IB) after wide local excision (WLE): Ten year results from a prospective trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate long term toxicity, cosmesis and local control of patients receiving dose-escalated APBI-IB alone after WLE for early stage breast cancer (bca). Materials/Methods: From 1997 - 2001, 50 patients with T1N0M0 bca were treated on a Phase I/II protocol using LDR APBIIB after WLE and lymph node surgery. APBI-IB was given 3 - 4 days after WLE at 50 cGy/hour with 192Ir sources evenly spaced 3 cm around the resection cavity. Total dose was escalated in 3 groups: 50 Gy (n = 20), 55 Gy (n = 17), 60 Gy (n = 13). Patient and physician assessed breast cosmesis, patient satisfaction, toxicities, mammographic abnormalities, rebiopsies, and disease status were prospectively evaluated. Kendall's tau (t) coefficient was used to correlate outcomes with dose and implant volume. Results: Median follow-up was 10.5 years (range, 3 - 14). Patient and physician assessment of cosmesis and toxicity were well correlated (t 0.6 - 1; p<0.0001). Patient satisfaction was 90% and 67% reported good-excellent cosmesis. Higher dose correlated with worse cosmesis (t 0.47; p = 0.0003) and lower patient satisfaction (t 0.46; p<0.001). Moderate-severe fibrosis was noted in 55% of patients and correlated with higher dose (t 0.56; p<0.0001). Forty percent of patients had fat necrosis, 35% had telangiectasias≥2 cm and 46% had mild-moderate breast color change. Grade 3 - 4 late skin and subcutaneous toxicity was seen in 4 patients (9%) and 6 patients (13%), respectively, and both correlated with higher dose (t 0.31 - 0.46; p<0.001). One patient had Grade 4 skin ulceration/fat necrosis requiring mastectomy. One third (32%) of patients had mammographic abnormalities in follow-up, 30% underwent rebiopsy of which 73% were benign. Six patients had ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, five elsewhere in the breast and one dermal recurrence at the implant site. One patient died of metastatic breast cancer after recurrence. Ten year actuarial local control and recurrence-free survival rates were 89% (95% CI, 78 - 100) and 82% (95% CI, 69 - 96), respectively. Results at 2 and 10.5 years are compared in the Table. (Table presented) Conclusions: LDR APBI-IB provides acceptable local control in select early stage bca patients. However, treatment-related toxicity and cosmetic complications have increased over time and were worse at higher doses. Obtaining long follow-up is critical in monitoring complications of APBI-IB over time."
"Hattangadi, J. A., et al.",2012,Accelerated partial breast irradiation with low-dose-rate interstitial implant brachytherapy after wide local excision: 12-year outcomes from a prospective trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the long-term toxicity, cosmesis, and local control of accelerated partial breast irradiation with implant brachytherapy after wide local excision for Stage T1N0 breast cancer (BCa). Materials and Methods: Between 1997 and 2001, 50 patients with Stage T1N0M0 BCa were treated in a Phase I-II protocol using low-dose-rate accelerated partial breast irradiation with implant brachytherapy after wide local excision and lymph node surgery. The total dose was escalated in three groups: 50 Gy (n = 20), 55 Gy (n = 17), and 60 Gy (n = 13). Patient- and physician-assessed breast cosmesis, patient satisfaction, toxicity, mammographic abnormalities, repeat biopsies, and disease status were prospectively evaluated at each visit. Kendall's tau (τβ) and logistic regression analyses were used to correlate outcomes with dose, implant volume, patient age, and systemic therapy. Results: The median follow-up period was 11.2 years (range, 4-14). The patient satisfaction rate was 67%, 67% reported good-excellent cosmesis, and 54% had moderate-severe fibrosis. Higher dose was correlated with worse cosmetic outcome (τβ 0.6, p <.0001), lower patient satisfaction (τβ 0.5, p <.001), and worse fibrosis (τβ 0.4, p =.0024). Of the 50 patients, 35% had fat necrosis and 34% developed telangiectasias ≥1 cm2. Grade 3-4 late skin and subcutaneous toxicities were seen in 4 patients (9%) and 6 patients (13%), respectively, and both correlated with higher dose (τβ 0.3-0.5, p ≤.01). One patient had Grade 4 skin ulceration and fat necrosis requiring surgery. Mammographic abnormalities were seen in 32% of the patients, and 30% underwent repeat biopsy, of which 73% were benign. Six patients had ipsilateral breast recurrence: five elsewhere in the breast, and one at the implant site. One patient died of metastatic BCa after recurrence. The 12-year actuarial local control, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival rate was 85% (95% confidence interval, 70-97%), 72% (95% confidence interval, 54-86%), and 87% (95% confidence interval, 73-99%), respectively. Conclusion: Low-dose-rate accelerated partial breast irradiation with implant brachytherapy provides acceptable local control in select early-stage BCa patients. However, treatment-related toxicity and cosmetic complications were significant with longer follow-up and at higher doses.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Healey, E. A., et al.",1989,Can the clinical and mammographic findings at presentation predict the presence of an extensive intraductal component in early stage breast cancer?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The presence or absence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC) in early stage infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma has been considered to be an important factor in determining the extent of breast resection required prior to radiation therapy. It would therefore be useful if the presence or absence of an extensive intraductal component in a breast tumor could be predicted pre-operatively. To determine whether selected radiographic features might be correlated with whether or not a cancer is EIC+, we reviewed the pre-operative mammographic findings in 105 cases of Stage I and II infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Forty-one cases were EIC+ and 64 were EIC-. Both EIC+ and EIC- tumors were commonly detectable by mammography (93% and 83%, respectively, p = NS). EIC+ cancers, however, were significantly more likely to show microcalcifications with or without a mass compared to EIC- cases (83% vs 27%, p < 0.0001). In particular, the presence of microcalcifications without a mammographic mass was more common for EIC+ cancers than EIC- cancers (34% vs 5% p = 0.0002). Conversely, a soft tissue mass without microcalcifications was seen mammographically in 56% of EIC- cases, compared to only 10% of EIC+ cases (p < 0.0001). Predictive value calculations showed that the presence of microcalcifications in the absence of a mammographic mass conveys a 73% likelihood a cancer will be EIC+ (95% confidence interval = 93-94%). The positive predictive value of a mammographic mass or architectural distortion without microcalcifications for an EIC- cancer was 92% (95% confidence interval = 79-98%). We conclude that the mammographic findings may be useful pre-operatively in differentiating between patients with and without an EIC. Microcalcifications are much more commonly associated with EIC+ cancers than EIC- cancers, and the presence of an EIC- cancer without a mammographic mass is infrequent. Further characterization of the extent and pattern of microcalcifications might improve the predictive value of mammography in the pre-operative identification of patients with an EIC."
"Healy, E., et al.",2014,Compliance with hormonal therapy in elderly women with early breast cancer who were not treated with adjuvant radiation following lumpectomy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Several recent studies have suggested that adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) can be omitted in select elderly women with early stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who consent to be treated with 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT). The purpose of this study was to determine compliance with and adherence to adjuvant HT for elderly women with breast cancer following breast conserving surgery (BCS) who were not treated with adjuvant RT. Materials/Methods: Women age 70 and older with hormone-receptor positive, early stage breast cancer who were treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) were examined. We investigated those patients who were either not referred to or declined adjuvant RT at our institution between 2006 and 2011. Data was obtained from consultation and progress notes of the surgical, radiation and medical oncology departments and was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 93 women treated with BCS, 79 women (85%) were referred to radiation oncology and 14 patients (15%) were not. Twelve referred patients (15%) declined RT following referral. In addition, of the 26 women who were not referred or declined adjuvant RT, 23 hormone-receptor positive women were included in the analysis. Thirteen patients (57%) were not referred for adjuvant RT and 10 patients (43%) declined adjuvant RT following referral. All patients were ER+, 96% HER 2 negative, and 87% had tumor sizes less than 2 cm. Nine patients (39%) did not have a sentinel lymph node biopsy done and therefore, had incomplete pathologic TNM staging. Twenty-two patients (96%)were recommended adjuvant HT.Of thosewho were recommendedHT, 14 (61%) initiated treatment with HT and 7 (30%) did not. Reasons for not initiating HT included failing to follow-up with medical oncology after BCS, increased age, personal preference and comorbidity. Of those who initiated HT, most women (93%, n = 13) were treated with an aromatase inhibitor. Three patients (21%) completed at least 5 years of HT, 5 patients (36%) are currently tolerating HT, and 6 patients (43%) discontinued HT. Reasons for discontinuing HT included disease progression, adverse effects and cost. Of those who discontinued HT, duration of treatment ranged from 1.6 to 24.6 months with an average of 9.8 months and median duration of 4 months. Conclusions: Of the elderly patients not treatedwith RT, themajority (57%, n =13) either did not initiate HT (n=7) or discontinued HT (n=6) prior to completing 5 years of therapy. Compliance with HT is an integral component of RT treatment decisions in the elderly population that has the potential to impact long term outcomes and needs to be better assessed."
"Heinzerling, J. H., et al.",2010,Comparative dose-volume analysis for cyberknife and 3d conformal partial breast irradiation treatment of early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the feasibility of CyberKnife (CK) partial breast irradiation (PBI) delivery for early stage breast cancer, and to compare target coverage and organ at risk (OAR) dose of 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) planning techniques with the CK system. Materials/Methods: Ten patients (pts) were selected with early stage breast cancer who had clearly delineated lumpectomy cavities and were candidates for PBI using the eligibility criteria of the current ongoing phase III trial evaluating PBI (RTOG 0413/ NSABP B-39). Pts were re-planned to a dose of 34 Gy in 10 fractions with both 3DCRT and CK. The lumpectomy cavity was contoured and expanded by 15 mm and reduced appropriately from the skin and chest wall to constitute the CTV. No PTV margin was added for this comparison. 3DCRT treatment plans were generated using 4-5 noncoplanar beams typically with 3 medial tangential beams and 1 lateral tangential beam with conformal blocks directed at the CTV. Plans were optimized to achieve optimal CTV coverage while minimizing organ at risk (OAR) doses to at least those consistent with the requirements stated on RTOG 0413, and plans were typically prescribed to 95-100%. For CK, inverse planning with specific dosimetric objectives was performed. One to two collimators were used to provide highly conformal dose distributions, and plans were typically prescribed to the 70-80% isodose line. Dose volume analysis for various endpoints was performed and comparative analysis was done using SAS (Cary, NC). Results: A total of 20 PBI breast plans (10 CK and 10 3DCRT) were generated, 12 left and 8 right breast plans, and were evaluated for CTV coverage and OAR dose-volume criteria of interest. Median CTV coverage (V100%) for CK and 3DCRT was 98% (range, 98-100%) and 95% (90-100%) respectively (p = 0.03). Median V15% to the ipsilateral lung was 3% (0-6%) for CK and 4% (0- 14%) for 3DCRT (p = 0.02). Median maximum point dose to the heart was 1.3 Gy (0.5-17) for CK and 7.8 Gy (0.8-33.7) for 3DCRT (p = 0.003). Median volume of ipsilateral breast receiving the prescription dose (V100%) was 13% (4-24) for CK and 22% (4-28) for 3DCRT (p = 0.004). V50% for the ipsilateral breast was 40% and 51% for CK and 3DCRT respectively (p = 0.003). Median maximum dose to the skin was 35.1 Gy (29.8-38.8) for CK and 32.1 Gy (29.9-37.9) for 3DCRT (p = 0.06). Materials/Methods: The “Air-bag System”, a novel respiratory monitoring device, consists of a non-elastic air bag connected with an elastic air bag. A non-elastic air bag is placed between the patient's body and the stereotactic fixation frame. A current meter located between two bags measures the air flows back and forth between two bags. The data are processed by personal computer and translated the respiratory motion into swinging decoy markers displayed on the computer screen so that an infrared camera of RPM system can capture the swinging marker instead of an infrared reflective marker. 4D-CT data of 15 lung cancer patients were acquired by the RPM system with the “Air-bag System”. On each phase of the 4D data, correlations between the lung volume and the body volume were evaluated. 4D-CT data of another 3 lung cancer patients were acquired by the RPM system recording with two different respiratory motions. One is an abdominal respiratory motion using an infrared reflective marker placed on the patient's abdomen, the other one is a thorax respiratory volume shift using the air bag set on the patient's chest. The respiratory phases (8 phases) at each instant in time based on modeling two different motion amplitudes were compared. Results: There was a strong correlation (r2 = 0.976) between the lung volume and the body volume on each respiratory phase. Comparing the reconstructed 4D-CT images on each respiratory phase recorded by using an infrared reflective marker to those recorded by using the “Air-bag System” resulted in no difference on all respiratory phases. Conclusions: The novel respiratory gating device which monitors the patient's body volume as an ex ernal respiration signal was developed. Recording with this “Air-bag System”, applicability of RPM system is not limited owing to enough amplitude and more accurate determination of the magnitude of respiratory motion. Moreover, abdominal compression with the air bag reduces the movement of diaphragm which can decrease the intra-thoracic organ motion without loading additional stress on the patient."
"Hennequin, C., et al.",1999,High-dose-rate brachytherapy for early breast cancer: An ambulatory technique.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate tolerance and efficiency of a boost dose delivered by high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRB) in conservative treatment of breast cancer. To evaluate the feasibility of brachytherapy on an out-patient basis. Methods: One hundred and six patients with T1-T2, N0-N1 breast cancers (108 breasts) have been treated with lumpectomy, external irradiation (45 Gy in 5 weeks), and a boost dose on the tumor bed with HDR iridium brachytherapy. Two fractions of 5 Gy were delivered 6 or 24 hours apart. Implantation was done during the lumpectomy (group A: 24 cases) or 3 to 4 weeks after the end of external irradiation (group B: 84 cases). For group B, the application was performed on local anesthesia, and did not require hospitalization. Characteristics of the population were as follows: T1: 77 (71.3%); T2: 31 (28.7%); median tumor size: 1.5 cm; histology: intraductal carcinomas (DCIS): 14 (13%); infiltrative ductal carcinomas (IDC): 84 (77.8%); others: 10 (9.2%). For IDC, surgical margins were found positive in 15 cases, and an extensive intraductal component was present in 22 cases. Results: All ambulatory HDR implants were performed as planned. No immediate toxicity was noticed, except 5 local hematomas. With a median follow-up of 45 months, 5 local relapses were observed (5-year local relapse rate: 5.1%). Only histological grade III was significantly correlated with local relapse. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were respectively 93.8% and 93.3%. Cosmetic result was evaluated in 87 cases, and was good or excellent in 48 cases (63.2%), acceptable in 27 cases, and poor in 5 cases. Conclusion: HDRB allows the boost dose to be performed on an out-patient basis. It seems to offer the same local control as other boost techniques for localized breast cancer with acceptable cosmetic results."
"Hepel, J. T., et al.",2014,Non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI): Analysis of acute toxicity and early outcomes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): APBI is a convenient option for appropriately selected women with early stage breast cancer. However, the current APBI techniques are not optimal for all patients either requiring percutaneous placement of catheter(s) or need for large margins to account for breast and respiratory motion. NIBB is a novel APBI technique that is not invasive, yet maintains a high degree of precision and conformality by using breast immobilization and image-guided targeting. Materials/Methods: Patients were enrolled to an IRB approved, prospective clinical trial evaluating APBI using NIBB. NIBB was delivered using the AccuBoost System (Advanced Radiation Therapy Inc., Boston, MA). Patients were immobilized with gentle breast compression and treated sequentially in 2 orthogonal treatment axes for each fraction. Radiation was delivered using collimated emissions from an HDR Ir-192 source via specialized applicators. The prescribed dose was 34.0 Gy in 10 fractions. Treatment was delivered either daily or twice daily at least 6 hours apart. Acute and late toxicity was assessed prospectively based on CTCAE v3.0. Cosmesis was assessed based on the Harvard scale. Results: Forty patients (accrual goal) with a median age of 68 years completed protocol treatment. A total of 62.5% had invasive carcinoma and the remainder had DCIS. Mean tumor size was 1.1 cm (0.3-3.0 cm) and 97.5% were ER+. All patients were node negative. 47.5% were categorized as “suitable” by ASTRO criteria and 52.5% “cautionary.” Mean tumor bed volume was 22.4 cc (1.1-69.6 cc) and mean breast volume was 1591 cc (365-3569 cc). Treatment was daily in 67% and BID in 33%. Overall, patients tolerated treatment very well. Median patient rated discomfort during treatment was scored 1 out of 10. Acute toxicity was mild with no grade 3 or greater toxicities observed. A total of 72.5% experienced either no acute skin reaction or faint erythema (Gr 0-1). The remaining patients had moderate erythema. No patient developed desquamation. Gr 2 skin reaction was associated with breast separation upon compression (p < 0.001) and applicator type (p = 0.001). Gr 2 skin reaction was seen in 62.5% using 1st generation applicator, 33.3% using a combination of 1st and 2nd generation applicators, and 0% using 2nd generation applicators. With a median follow-up time of 12 months, no late grade 2 or greater toxicity has been observed. Good-to-excellent cosmetic outcome has been 97.5%. One patient developed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence outside the treatment volume and 2 patients have developed contralateral second primaries. Conclusions: APBI delivered using NIBB is feasible and well tolerated by patients with no significant acute toxicity. Second generation applicators appear to result in virtually no skin reaction. Early results of late toxicity and efficacy are encouraging. Longer follow-up and continued investigation is warranted to assess these late endpoints."
"Hepel, J. T., et al.",2017,5 fraction accelerated partial breast irradiation using non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy: Feasibility and acute toxicity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To improve efficiency, convenience, and cost, it would be desirable to reduce the number of fractions required to deliver APBI. A prospective phase II trial was initiated to evaluate APBI delivered with NIBB via 5 once daily fractions. We present initial results of feasibility and acute toxicity of this approach. Purpose/Objective(s): Women ≥ 50 yo with early-stage breast cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery were enrolled. Patient eligibility criteria included: invasive carcinoma ≤2.0 cm or DCIS ≤3.0 cm, ER positive (if invasive), lymph node negative, LVI absent, and margins negative by 2 mm. Patients received a total dose of 28.5 Gy in 5 daily fractions of 5.7 Gy. NIBB was delivered using 2 orthogonal treatment axes for each fraction. Applicators were selected to cover the lumpectomy cavity with a 1.0 cm CTV margin and a 0-0.5 cm PTV margin. Acute and late toxicity was assessed based on CTCAE v3.0. Results: 40 patients with a mean age of 67 yrs (range: 50-89 yrs) have completed protocol treatment. 97.5% were post-menopausal. Mean tumor size was 1.0 cm (range: 0.3-2.0 cm). 80% had invasive carcinoma and the remainder had pure DCIS. All tumors were ER positive and lymph node negative. The mean tumor bed volume was 21 cc (range: 5-79 cc) and mean breast volume was 1319 cc (range: 499-3044 cc). All patients completed protocol treatment and treatment was well tolerated. Mean breast separation with compression was 6.7 cm (3.5-8.9 cm). Median discomfort secondary to breast compression was 1 (range: 0-6) on a ten-point pain scale. Average treatment time per treatment axis was 21 mins (range: 14-28 mins) and average time from start of first treatment axis to completion of orthogonal treatment axis was 65 mins (range: 32-113 mins). Most patients were treated with 2nd generation SDO applicators. No unexpected acute toxicities were observed. Acute skin reaction was grade 0-1 in 28 pts (70%), grade 2 in 11 pts (28%), and grade 3 in 1 pt (3%). Acute skin toxicity was not associated with breast size but was associated with larger breast separation during treatment (p<0.02) and larger treatment volume (applicator size >6 cm) (p<0.04). No significant late toxicity or local recurrences have been observed at a median f/u of 9 mos. Conclusion: APBI delivered using NIBB over 5 daily fractions is a convenient treatment option that is feasible. Acute grade 2+ skin reaction, which was associated with wider separation and larger treatment volumes, is higher than previously observed with treatment over 10 fractions. Follow up is needed to determine is this translates into a higher rate of late skin toxicity."
"Herbert, C., et al.",2012,The impact of hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy on local relapse in patients with grade 3 early breast cancer: A population-based cohort study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine whether patients with Grade 3 early breast cancer have an inferior rate of local disease control at 10 years with hypofractionated radiotherapy compared with more conventionally fractionated schedules. Methods and Materials: Local relapse rates were compared between patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to the whole breast in a population-based cohort of women with early-stage (T1-T2, N0, M0) Grade 3 breast cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 and referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Cumulative rates of local relapse were estimated using a competing risk method, and factors significant on univariate analysis were included with fractionation group in a multivariate model. The primary end point was local control at 10 years. Results: A total of 1,335 patients with Grade 3 tumors were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, 252 with conventional fractionation, and 1,083 with a hypofractionated schedule. The 10-year cumulative incidence of local relapse was 6.9% in the hypofractionated group and 6.2% in the conventionally fractionated group (p = 0.99). Conclusions: There is no evidence that hypofractionation is inferior to conventional fractionation for breast conserving therapy in patients with Grade 3 breast cancer in this large population-based series after 10 years of follow-up.

"Herskind, C., et al.",2008,Sphere of Equivalence-A Novel Target Volume Concept for Intraoperative Radiotherapy Using Low-Energy X Rays.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Accelerated partial breast radiotherapy with low-energy photons from a miniature X-ray machine is undergoing a randomized clinical trial (Targeted Intra-operative Radiation Therapy [TARGIT]) in a selected subgroup of patients treated with breast-conserving surgery. The steep radial dose gradient implies reduced tumor cell control with increasing depth in the tumor bed. The purpose was to compare the expected risk of local recurrence in this nonuniform radiation field with that after conventional external beam radiotherapy. Methods and Materials: The relative biologic effectiveness of low-energy photons was modeled using the linear-quadratic formalism including repair of sublethal lesions during protracted irradiation. Doses of 50-kV X-rays (Intrabeam) were converted to equivalent fractionated doses, EQD2, as function of depth in the tumor bed. The probability of local control was estimated using a logistic dose-response relationship fitted to clinical data from fractionated radiotherapy. Results: The model calculations show that, for a cohort of patients, the increase in local control in the high-dose region near the applicator partly compensates the reduction of local control at greater distances. Thus a sphere of equivalence"" exists within which the risk of recurrence is equal to that after external fractionated radiotherapy. The spatial distribution of recurrences inside this sphere will be different from that after conventional radiotherapy. Conclusions: A novel target volume concept is presented here. The incidence of recurrences arising in the tumor bed around the excised tumor will test the validity of this concept and the efficacy of the treatment. Recurrences elsewhere will have implications for the rationale of TARGIT.  Inc. All rights reserved."""
"Hetelekidis, S., et al.",2000,The significance of extracapsular extension of axillary lymph node metastases in early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To investigate if extracapsular extension (ECE) of axillary lymph node metastases predicts for a decreased rate of disease-free survival or an increased rate of regional recurrence of breast carcinoma.Methods: The study population consisted of 368 patients with T1 or T2 breast cancer and pathologically-positive lymph nodes treated with breast-conserving therapy between 1968 and 1986. The median number of sampled lymph nodes was 10. Median follow-up time for the surviving patients was 139 months (range 70-244). Twenty percent of the patients were treated with supraclavicular RT, and 64% received both axillary and supraclavicular RT, with a median dose to the nodes of 45 Gy. The following factors were evaluated: presence of ECE, number of sampled lymph nodes (LN), number of involved LN, size of primary tumor, histologic grade of tumor, presence of lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC), radiation dose, use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and age of patient. Recurrences were reported as the 5-year crude sites of first failure, and were divided into breast recurrences (LR), regional nodal failure (RNF, defined as isolated axillary, supraclavicular, or internal mammary recurrence), and distant metastases (DM).Results: One hundred twenty-two patients (33%) had ECE and 246 patients did not. The median number of LN with ECE was 1 (range 1-10) and 20% of patients had ECE in ≥ 4 LN. Patients with ECE tended to be older (median age 51 vs. 47, p = 0.01), and had a higher number of involved LN (median 3 vs. 2, p = 0.005) than patients without ECE. Forty-three percent of patients with ECE had ≥ 4 involved LN compared to 15% of patients without ECE (p < 0.0001). Models of ECE and the above factors revealed no significant correlation between ECE and either disease-free or overall survival. There was no statistically significant increase in local, regional nodal, or distant failures in patients with ECE as compared to patients without ECE.Conclusion: In this population of patients with nodal involvement, the presence of ECE correlates with the number of involved LN but does not appear to add predictive power to models of local, regional, or distant recurrence when the number of positive LN is included.

"Hijal, T., et al.",2011,Dosimetric findings and acute side effects of patients treated in the lateral decubitus position with whole breast radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate whole breast 3D-conformal radiotherapy (RT) delivered in the lateral decubitus position (isocentric lateral decubitus [ILD]) and to report the acute toxicity of a series of consecutive patients treated with ILD. Materials/Methods: From January to December 2010, 56 consecutive patients with large breasts and early-stage (T1-2N0M0) breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery underwent CT simulation and RT planning followed by whole breast RT in the lateral decubitus position. A dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions via two opposed isocentric beams was prescribed to whole breast, with or without a 16 Gy photon tumor bed boost. The lymph node areas were not irradiated. Dosimetry of all patients was reviewed, with an emphasis on organs at risk. Furthermore, the acute toxicity of treatment, evaluated weekly using the NCI CTC v3.0 scale, was also analyzed. Results: Median age was 57 years (range: 33-71). 85% of patients had a breast circumference of at least 95 cm and 80% had at least a C cup size. Average breast volume was 991 cm3 (range: 225-2791 cm3), while average breast separation was 12.25 cm (range: 8.1-20 cm), as calculated per CT scan data. 33% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 12.5% of patients received concomitant chemotherapy or biologics. Median dose to the breast was 50 Gy, while median dose to the tumor bed was 16 Gy. 1 patient (3%) did not develop acute dermatitis. Grade 1, 2 and 3 dermatitis developed in 36%, 58% and 3% of patients, respectively. From a dosimetric point of view, doses to the ipsilateral lung were extremely low: Average V1Gy, V2Gy and V5Gy were 26.55%, 9.27% and 0.74%, respectively. Average mean lung dose was 0.96 Gy. For the 26 patients with left-sided tumors, heart doses were also extremely low: Average V1Gy, V2Gy and V5Gy were 58.82%, was 14.21% and 0.73%, respectively. Average mean heart dose was 1.35 Gy. Conclusions: Whole breast radiotherapy in the lateral decubitus position for patients with large breasts and early-stage breast cancer provides an excellent dosimetric profile, with low doses the heart and ipsilateral lung. It is also very well tolerated, with a good acute toxicity profile."
"Hill-Kayser, C. E., et al.",2006,Twenty-year incidence and patterns of contralateral breast cancer after breast conservation treatment with radiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CLB) after treatment for early-stage breast cancer with breast-conserving treatment (BCT), and to observe patterns of CLB presentation. Methods: Medical records of 1,801 women treated for unilateral AJCC Stage 0-II breast cancer with BCT between 1977 and 2000 were analyzed as a retrospective cohort. Results: The incidence of any CLB at 20 years was 15.4%. The annual risk of developing any CLB remained constant at approximately 0.75% per year after treatment. The median time to any CLB was 8.2 years (range, 0.5-26.5 years). No difference in incidence of CLB was demonstrated in patients with primary invasive carcinoma vs. DCIS (p = 0.84). The majority of patients (83%) developing CLB tumors developed invasive disease. The risk of developing an invasive CLB did not differ significantly for patients with DCIS vs. those with primary invasive carcinoma (p = 0.20). The method of detection of the primary tumor (mammography vs. physical examination) was not predictive of detection of the CLB (p = 0.20). Finally, the location of CLB tumors was not affected by that of prior tumors (p = 0.82). Conclusions: The risk of development of CLB persists for at least 20 years after treatment for early-stage breast cancer. CLB tumors are frequently invasive, and their location is not influenced by location of prior tumors. Mammography and physical examination remain essential after BCT for detection of a contralateral breast cancer, regardless of the method of detection of the primary tumor.  Inc.

"Hirsch, A. E., et al.",2009,An Increase in Medical Student Knowledge of Radiation Oncology: A Pre-Post Examination Analysis of the Oncology Education Initiative.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The Oncology Education Initiative was created to advance oncology and radiation oncology education by integrating structured didactics into the existing core radiology clerkship. We set out to determine whether the addition of structured didactics could lead to a significant increase in overall medical student knowledge about radiation oncology. Methods and Materials: We conducted a pre- and posttest examining concepts in general radiation oncology, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. The 15-question, multiple-choice exam was administered before and after a 1.5-hour didactic lecture by an attending physician in radiation oncology. Individual question changes, overall student changes, and overall categorical changes were analyzed. All hypothesis tests were two-tailed (significance level 0.05). Results: Of the 153 fourth-year students, 137 (90%) took the pre- and posttest and were present for the didactic lecture. The average test grade improved from 59% to 70% (p = 0.011). Improvement was seen in all questions except clinical vignettes involving correct identification of TNM staging. Statistically significant improvement (p ≤ 0.03) was seen in the questions regarding acute and late side effects of radiation, brachytherapy for prostate cancer, delivery of radiation treatment, and management of early-stage breast cancer. Conclusions: Addition of didactics in radiation oncology significantly improves medical students' knowledge of the topic. Despite perceived difficulty in teaching radiation oncology and the assumption that it is beyond the scope of reasonable knowledge for medical students, we have shown that even with one dedicated lecture, students can learn and absorb general principles regarding radiation oncology.

"Ho, A. Y., et al.",2007,Possession of ATM Sequence Variants as Predictor for Late Normal Tissue Responses in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The ATM gene product is a central component of cell cycle regulation and genomic surveillance. We hypothesized that DNA sequence alterations in ATM predict for adverse effects after external beam radiotherapy for early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow-up who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy were screened for sequence alterations in ATM using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Genetic variants were identified using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late morbidity scoring schemes for skin and subcutaneous tissues were applied to quantify the radiation-induced effects. Results: Of the 131 patients, 51 possessed ATM sequence alterations located within exons or in short intron regions flanking each exon that encompass putative splice site regions. Of these 51 patients, 21 (41%) exhibited a minimum of a Grade 2 late radiation response. In contrast, of the 80 patients without an ATM sequence variation, only 18 (23%) had radiation-induced adverse responses, for an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2). Fifteen patients were heterozygous for the G→A polymorphism at nucleotide 5557, which causes substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 1853 of the ATM protein. Of these 15 patients, 8 (53%) exhibited a Grade 2-4 late response compared with 31 (27%) of the 116 patients without this alteration, for an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4). Conclusion: Sequence variants located in the ATM gene, in particular the 5557 G→A polymorphism, may predict for late adverse radiation responses in breast cancer patients.  Inc.

"Holliday, E. B., et al.",2017,Lower mean heart dose with deep inspiration breath hold-whole breast irradiation compared with brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation for women with left-sided tumors.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Purpose For left-sided breast cancer, radiation to the heart is a concern. We present a comparison of mean heart and coronary artery biologically effective dose (BED) between accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and whole breast irradiation with deep inspiration breath-hold technique (DIBH-WBI). Methods and materials A total of 100 patients with left-sided, early-stage breast cancer were identified. Fifty underwent single-entry catheter-based APBI and 50 underwent DIBH-WBI. The heart, left anterior descending/interventricular branch, left main, and right coronary artery were delineated. BEDs were calculated from APBI treatment plans (34 Gy in 3.4 Gy twice daily fractions) and for 4 separate plans generated for each DIBH-WBI patient: 50 Gy in 25 fractions (50/25), 50/25 + 10/5 boost, 40/15, and 40/15 + 10/5 boost. Results BED to the heart and coronary vessels were statistically significantly higher with APBI than with any of the DIBH-WBI dose/fractionation schedules. Conclusions For women with left-sided early-stage breast cancer, DIBH-WBI resulted in statistically significantly lower mean BED to the heart and coronary vessels compared with APBI. This is likely due to increased physical separation between the heart and tumor bed afforded by the DIBH-WBI technique. Long-term assessment of late effects in these tissues will be required to determine whether these differences are clinically significant."
"Hooning, M. J., et al.",2006,Cause-specific mortality in long-term survivors of breast cancer: A 25-year follow-up study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess long-term cause-specific mortality in breast cancer patients. Patients and Methods: We studied mortality in 7425 patients treated for early breast cancer between 1970 and 1986. Follow-up was 94% complete until January 2000. Treatment-specific mortality was evaluated by calculating standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) based on comparison with general population rates and by using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: After a median follow-up of 13.8 years, 4160 deaths were observed, of which 76% were due to breast cancer. Second malignancies showed a slightly increased SMR of 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.3). Radiotherapy (RT) as compared with surgery was associated with a 1.7-fold (95% CI, 1.2-2.5) increased mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). After postlumpectomy RT, no increased mortality from CVD was observed (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-1.9). Postmastectomy RT administered before 1979 and between 1979 and 1986 was associated with a 2-fold (95% CI, 1.2-3.4) and 1.5-fold (95% CI, 0.9-2.7) increase, respectively. Patients treated before age 45 experienced a higher SMR (2.0) for both solid tumors (95% CI, 1.6-2.7) and CVD (95% CI, 1.3-3.1). Conclusion: Currently, a large population of breast cancer survivors is at increased risk of death from CVDs and second cancers, especially when treated with RT at a young age. Patients irradiated after 1979 experience low (postmastectomy RT) or no (postlumpectomy RT) excess mortality from CVD.  Inc."
"Horton, J. K., et al.",2014,Preoperative partial breast radiation therapy: One year outcomes and radiation-induced changes in gene expression.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Women with biologically favorable early stage breast cancer are increasingly treated with accelerated partial breast radiation (PBI). However, many PBI techniques require equipment or skills not readily available. Furthermore, suboptimal cosmetic outcomes have been noted with external beam techniques, likely related to large post-operative treatment volumes. To address these issues, we designed a phase I protocol utilizing widely available radiation techniques to 1) evaluate patients' tolerance of a single radiation treatment delivered preoperatively to a small-volume, intact breast tumor and 2) identify biomarkers of radiation response. Materials/Methods: Women aged 55 or older with clinically node negative, ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-, T1 invasive carcinomas or low-intermediate grade in situ disease < 2 cm were enrolled (n = 32). Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was used to deliver 15, 18, or 21 Gy to the tumor plus a 1.5 cm margin. Lumpectomy was performed within 10 days. Patients with high-risk pathologic features received conventional radiation (n = 3) postoperatively. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, pre- and post-radiation patient samples were used for gene expression profiling. Gene expression in paired samples was evaluated with the RMA algorithm and the Bioconductor limma package with correction for multiple comparisons. Results: No locoregional or distant recurrences have been reported (median follow-up 12.6 months). Cosmetic outcomes are good/ excellent in all patients receiving only preoperative radiation. Chronic toxicities were primarily grade 1-2 and expected (fibrosis, breast pain, skin induration). One grade 3 toxicity (breast atrophy) occurred in a patient receiving postoperative radiation. Genes significantly induced with radiation are listed in Table 1. Specifically, genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle control were differentially expressed in tumors after radiation. Conclusions: Preoperative single-dose radiation therapy to the intact breast tumor is efficacious and well-tolerated at one year. Genes governing radiation response, including those involved in cell cycle control and programmed cell death, may play a role in the increased radiation sensitivity observed clinically in ER+ cancers. Our groundbreaking study describes specific pathways modulated by radiation in human breast tumors. We expect this to aid in identification of therapeutic targets for biologically based radiation therapy. (Table Presented)."
"Horton, J. K., et al.",2013,Preoperative single-fraction partial breast radiation therapy: A novel phase 1 dose-escalation protocol and exploration of breast cancer radiation response.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objectives(s): Breast radiation is nearly always delivered adjuvantly, eliminating the opportunity to investigate breast tumor radiation response. However, women with early stage breast cancer are increasingly treated with accelerated partial breast fractionation schemas and represent an ideal population in which to evaluate a novel pre-surgical treatment approach. We designed a phase I dose-escalation protocol to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of a single radiosurgery treatment delivered pre-operatively to the intact tumor; including pre/posttreatment MRI imaging and tumor biopsies. Materials/Methods: Women aged 55 or older with clinically node negative, ER and/or PR+, HER2-, T1 invasive carcinomas were enrolled (n=19). Patients with low/intermediate grade in situ disease <2 cm were also included (n=5). Breast MRI was required for target volume delineation and an intensity-modulated treatment plan was designed to deliver 15, 18, or 21 Gy in a single fraction. This was followed by repeat breast MRI and surgical excision within 10 days of radiation treatment. Biopsy tissue was obtained from diagnostic and lumpectomy specimens. Acute toxicity was assessed 3-4 weeks after radiation and any grade 3/4 toxicity was dose limiting. Results: Twenty-four women were treated, 8 at each dose level, without reaching the MTD. An expansion cohort at 21 Gy is ongoing. Two patients required chemotherapy and sixteen are receiving endocrine therapy. Three patients required post-operative conventional radiation due to high-risk tumor features (ex. larger primary, nodal involvement). Median follow-up is 6.5 months. Toxicities are mild (grade 1-2) and primarily attributable to surgery. In patients having completed 6 month follow-up (n=15), all cosmetic outcomes are good or excellent according to physician and patient. There have been no local or distant recurrences to date. Posttreatment MRIs were obtained in 13/24 patients, with early indicators of decreased cell density and increased vascular permeability. Fresh frozen core biopsies were procured from lumpectomy specimens but tumor yield was low due to small primary tumor size. Analysis of radiation response in paired paraffin-embedded tissues is ongoing. Conclusions: Stereotactic radiation therapy to the intact breast tumor tremendously simplifies breast radiation therapy for patients, can be delivered with widely available clinical tools, and provides a unique opportunity to study the imaging and molecular response of breast tumors to radiation. A dose of 21 Gy did not yield dose-limiting toxicity and will be utilized for future studies. Assessment of local control and long-term toxicity will be critical in determining future clinical application of this technique."
"Horton, J. K., et al.",2015,"Preoperative single-fraction partial breast radiation therapy: A novel phase 1, dose-escalation protocol with radiation response biomarkers.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Women with biologically favorable early-stage breast cancer are increasingly treated with accelerated partial breast radiation (PBI). However, treatment-related morbidities have been linked to the large postoperative treatment volumes required for external beam PBI. Relative to external beam delivery, alternative PBI techniques require equipment that is not universally available. To address these issues, we designed a phase 1 trial utilizing widely available technology to 1) evaluate the safety of a single radiation treatment delivered preoperatively to the small-volume, intact breast tumor and 2) identify imaging and genomic markers of radiation response. Methods and Materials Women aged ≥55 years with clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, and/or progesterone receptor-positive HER2-, T1 invasive carcinomas, or low- to intermediate-grade in situ disease ≤2 cm were enrolled (n=32). Intensity modulated radiation therapy was used to deliver 15 Gy (n=8), 18 Gy (n=8), or 21 Gy (n=16) to the tumor with a 1.5-cm margin. Lumpectomy was performed within 10 days. Paired pre- and postradiation magnetic resonance images and patient tumor samples were analyzed. Results No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. At a median follow-up of 23 months, there have been no recurrences. Physician-rated cosmetic outcomes were good/excellent, and chronic toxicities were grade 1 to 2 (fibrosis, hyperpigmentation) in patients receiving preoperative radiation only. Evidence of dose-dependent changes in vascular permeability, cell density, and expression of genes regulating immunity and cell death were seen in response to radiation. Conclusions Preoperative single-dose radiation therapy to intact breast tumors is well tolerated. Radiation response is marked by early indicators of cell death in this biologically favorable patient cohort. This study represents a first step toward a novel partial breast radiation approach. Preoperative radiation should be tested in future clinical trials because it has the potential to challenge the current treatment paradigm and provide a path forward to identify radiation response biomarkers."
"Horton, J. K., et al.",2006,Comparison of three concomitant boost techniques for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Whole breast radiotherapy (RT) followed by a tumor bed boost typically spans 5-6 weeks of treatment. Interest is growing in RT regimens, such as concomitant boost, that decrease overall treatment time, lessening the time/cost burden to patients and facilities. Methods and Materials: Computed tomography (CT) scans from 20 cases were selected for this retrospective, dosimetric study to compare three different techniques of concomitant boost delivery: (1) standard tangents plus an electron boost, (2) intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) tangents using custom compensators plus an electron boost, and (3) IMRT tangents plus a conformal photon boost. The equivalent uniform dose model was used to compare the plans. Results: The average breast equivalent uniform dose value for the three techniques (standard, IMRT plus electrons, and IMRT plus photons) was 48.6, 47.9, and 48.3, respectively. The plans using IMRT more closely approximated the prescribed dose of 46 Gy to the whole breast. The breast volume receiving >110% of the dose was less with the IMRT tangents than with standard RT (p = 0.037), but no significant difference in the maximal dose or other evaluated parameters was noted. Conclusion: Although the IMRT techniques delivered the prescribed dose with better dose uniformity, the small improvement seen did not support a goal of improved resource use.  Inc."
"Hosni, A., et al.",2015,Weekly concomitant boost during whole-breast hypofractionated radiation therapy: A feasibility and toxicity study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility, acute and late toxicity of a hypofractionated three weeks whole breast irradiation schedule with concomitant boost to the tumor bed once- a- week, in patients with early stage breast cancer. Correlation between acute and late skin toxicity with patient and treatment characteristics was also analyzed. Materials/Methods: Sixty seven women with early stage invasive breast cancer underwent conservative surgery were enrolled in this study. All patients were treated with a hypofractionated forward planned tangential IMRT. The basic course for whole breast irradiation consisted of 40 Gy in 15 fractions, 5 times a week, for 3 weeks plus a concomitant weekly boost dose to lumpectomy area of 3 Gy in 3 fractions. Acute skin toxicity was graded based on the RTOG acute toxicity scale. Late skin toxicity was assessed at 6 months from the end of radiation therapy and thereafter and was scored with RTOG/EORTC scale. Results: In our population study, the median follow up was 25 months (range, 11-34); median age was 49 years (range, 31 - 69); 19 T1 (28%) and 48 T2 (72%); 59 histological grade 2/3 (88%); 20 ER/PR negative (30%), 10 HER2 positive (15%), all patients with negative surgical margin (at least 2 mm) and 6 had diabetes mellitus (9%). Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide; 43 (64%) before and 24 (36%) after radiation therapy; while 47 patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy (33 tamoxifen and 14 aromatase inhibitor). The median contoured clinical target volume (CTV) of breast and boost were 1593 cc and 250 cc; respectively. At last follow up, all patients were alive without locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis. Acute skin toxicity was: G1 (n=47, 70.1%), G2 (n=9, 13.4%) and G3 (n=1, 1.5%). On multivariate analysis (MVA), diabetes mellitus was the only significant variable to predict acute toxicity (p= 0.003). Late G1 skin toxicity was observed in 13 patients (19.4%). No late toxicity more than G1 was observed. In MVA, age (p=0.029) and diabetes mellitus (p= 0.013) correlated with late radiation toxicity. Conclusion: The proposed whole breast irradiation with concomitant weekly boost appears to be feasible and safe. Further research is required to prove the efficacy of this schedule as an alternative option to standard sequential boost technique."
"Housri, N., et al.",2013,"Non-white women are as likely as white women to receive hypofractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer, but less likely to enroll in hypofractionation clinical trials.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Previous studies have found minorities to be under-represented in cancer clinical trials in the United States. Our institution has successfully offered and conducted multiple phase I and II hypofractionated breast radiation therapy trials (HBRTs) for early stage breast cancer. We sought to examine whether non-White patients treated at our institution were as likely as White patients to enroll in HBRTs or to receive hypofractionated treatment off-trial. Materials/Methods: Between June 2009 and December 2012, 132 patients were treated with 3 novel HBRTs at our institution. An additional cohort of 458 patients treated for breast cancer in our clinic during this period were randomly selected and evaluated. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to determine patient trial eligibility, demographics, tumor stage, hormone receptor status, radiation dose, use of chemotherapy, use of brachytherapy, and the site of initial consultation (a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic versus the radiation oncology clinic). Results: Over a 42 month time period, 132 patients treated on HBRTs received 2475-4995 cGy over 3 to 15 fractions. Forty-seven of these patients were treated using partial breast irradiation, including 13 treated with brachytherapy, and 85 received whole breast radiation therapy. Of the 458 randomly selected patients who were treated off protocol, 132 met eligibility criteria for at least one of the HBRTs. Most of these patients received conventional fractionation of 6000-6600 cGy, although 39% were treated with a hypofractionated regimen of 3400-5272 cGy. There were no statistically significant differences between the protocol and off-protocol groups in terms of age, T-stage, estrogen receptor status, use of chemotherapy, site of initial consultation, or the use of brachytherapy. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of non-White women who enrolled in HBRTs compared to those treated off-trial (25.7% vs 40.1%, p = 0.0129). In the patients treated off trial, there was no difference in in non-White versus White women who received hypofractionated treatment (37.7% vs 40.5%, p = 0. 0.7495). Conclusions: In this cohort of patients treated on and off-HBRTs, non- White women were less likely to enroll in HBRTs than Whites, but were as likely to receive hypofractionated radiation therapy off-trial. This suggests that the actual treatment offered by a clinical trial may not be a deterrent to enrollment, as patients were as likely to receive similar treatment outside the setting of a clinical trial."
"Huang, W., et al.",2016,A comparison of lumpectomy cavity delineations between use of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography acquired with patient in prone position for radiation therapy planning of breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To compare lumpectomy cavity (LC) and planning target volume (PTV) delineated with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) and to examine the possibility of replacing CT with MRI for radiation therapy (RT) planning for breast cancer. Methods and Materials MRI and CT data were acquired for 15 patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing lumpectomy during RT simulation in prone positions, the same as their RT treatment positions. The LCs were delineated manually on both CT (LC-CT) and MRI acquired with 4 sequences: T1, T2, STIR, and DCE. Various PTVs were created by expanding a 15-mm margin from the corresponding LCs and from the union of the LCs for the 4 MRI sequences (PTV-MRI). Differences were measured in terms of cavity visualization score (CVS) and dice coefficient (DC). Results The mean CVSs for T1, T2, STIR, DCE, and CT defined LCs were 3.47, 3.47, 3.87, 3.50. and 2.60, respectively, implying that the LC is mostly visible with a STIR sequence. The mean reductions of LCs from those for CT were 22%, 43%, 36%, and 17% for T1, T2, STIR, and DCE, respectively. In 14 of 15 cases, MRI (union of T1, T2, STIR, and DCE) defined LC included extra regions that would not be visible from CT. The DCs between CT and MRI (union of T1, T2, STIR, and DCE) defined volumes were 0.65 ± 0.20 for LCs and 0.85 ± 0.06 for PTVs. There was no obvious difference between the volumes of PTV-MRI and PTV-CT, and the average PTV-STIR/PTV-CT volume ratio was 0.83 ± 0.23. Conclusions The use of MRI improves the visibility of LC in comparison with CT. The volumes of LC and PTV generated based on a MRI sequence are substantially smaller than those based on CT, and the PTV-MRI volumes, defined by the union of T1, T2, STIR, and DCE, were comparable with those of PTV-CT for most of the cases studied."
"Huynh, M. A., et al.",2016,Significant reduction in breast cancer risk as long-term Hodgkin lymphoma survivors reach menopausal age.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Women who received chest irradiation (RT) for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) at a young age are at increased risk for breast cancer (BC). Treatment-related early menopause is protective against BC but limited data are available on changes in risk as survivors enter menopause. We aimed to assess the excess BC risk of HL survivors compared with a normal age-matched population as survivors pass menopause, and to compare the excess risks of premenopausal versus postmenopausal survivors. Materials/Methods: HL treatment history, subsequent invasive BC or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) development, menopausal status, and hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) history were abstracted from a HL database and medical records with IRB approval. The study included 555 women who had chest RT for HL at age <35 between 1968 and 2005. Attained age >50, pelvic RT and MOPP chemotherapy exposure were used as surrogates for menopause in 109 cases of missing menopausal status data. Postmenopausal women on HRT were considered premenopausal. Median age at RT was 23 (range = 6-35) and median current attained age was 39 (range = 12-69). SEER data were used to calculate relative (RR) and absolute excess risk (AR, per 10,000 person-years). Results: With a median follow-up time of 20.5 years (range = 0.7-42.4), 107 women developed at least one BC, including 92 with invasive BC, 21 with DCIS, and 14 with two BCs. Median time from RT to BC diagnosis was 18 years (range = 6-39). The overall RR for developing BC was 14.4 (95% CI = 11.8-17.4) with an AR of 107.8. For survivors with attained ages <50, 50-55, and 56-60, RRs were 32.1 (25.7-39.5), 6.5 (3.6-10.9), and 3.7 (1.2-8.6), respectively (P-trend < 0.001) with corresponding ARs of 134.3, 73.6, and 47.2. There was no BC observed among survivors with attained age >60. The RRs of premenopausal and postmenopausal survivors were 27.7 (22.0-34.5) and 5.8 (3.8-8.5), respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding ARs were 136.8 and 60.9. Conclusion: These results showed a significant drop in BC risk as HL survivors reach menopausal age, although the risk remained elevated compared to that of women without a prior HL diagnosis. The decline in BC risk in postmenopausal survivors suggests that they may be considered for less aggressive BC screening (e.g., mammogram alone), and may have implications for broadening breast-conserving therapy options and for preserving the contralateral breast in postmenopausal survivors who develop BC. This risk may also be mitigated in the era of modern radiation therapy, with the use of smaller fields and lower doses."
"Hwang, L., et al.",2015,Outcomes of hypofractionated versus standard fractionated breast cancer radiation in the real world: A population-based analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Randomized trials have compared hypofractionated (11-24 fractions) and standard fractionated (25-40 fractions) breast radiation after breast conserving surgery and have found no differences in local control, overall survival, or cosmetic outcome. We hypothesize that the perception amongst US physicians of the risk of late toxicity with hypofractionated radiation therapy has hindered the use of hypofractionated radiation therapy. The purpose of this study is to use populationbased data to understand the real-world toxicity and tumor control in early stage breast cancer patients receiving either hypofractionated or standard fractionated radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify early stage breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 who were treated with breast conserving therapy. Using Medicare claims data, we identified a cohort of hypofractionated and a cohort of standard fractionated radiation therapy patients. We then identified radiation-related toxicities, including cardiac toxicities (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, valvular disease, conduction disorders, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and pericardial disease), breast-specific toxicities, hematologic toxicities, plexopathies, radiation pneumonitis, and upper extremity fractures. Additionally, we examined the rates of local tumor control and secondary malignancies. Each toxicity was determined by the presence of its ICD-9 diagnosis code or HCPCS code within the Medicare claims data. The association between radiation fractionation and the endpoints of toxicity and local tumor control was determined with cumulative incidence analysis and Fine-Gray regression. Results: Our study population consisted of 23,125 women with early stage breast cancer who received breast conserving surgery followed by either hypofractionated (n=1,497) or standard fractionated (n=21,628) radiation therapy. Women in the hypofractionation cohort were older and had greater comorbidity than those in the standard fractionation cohort. On univariate analysis, we found that hypofractionation was associated with a low but slightly increased rate of local tumor recurrence (3.1% vs 1.5%, p=0.05) compared to standard fractionation. This remained significant on multivariate analysis (SDHR 1.72, p=0.05). All other toxicity endpoints were nonsignificant on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Conclusion: In a real-world cohort of older women with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving therapy, hypofractionated radiation therapy has equivalent rates of treatment-related toxicity in comparison to standard fractionated radiation therapy."
"Irabor, O. C., et al.",2019,Expanding Global Access to Breast and Prostate Radiotherapy through Evidence-based Hypofractionation Techniques.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Radiotherapy (RT) is needed for management of over half of all cancer cases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Unfortunately, many LMICs have limited RT access. Hypofractionated (HF) RT techniques have the potential to reduce treatment time and cost, thereby increasing access. Using Africa as a case study, this study estimates the potential changes in RT access and cost-savings that would occur with the global adoption of evidence-based HF over the conventional fractionation (CF) prescription for early breast cancer (WBRT) and localized prostate cancer (ProRT) in LMICs. Materials/Methods: Using an accepted value of 9700 fractions as the annual treatment capacity of an external beam RT unit (EBRT), we estimated the number of courses an EBRT can deliver at the CF and HF protocols for WBRT and ProRT. CF and HF for WBRT where ‘25fr/2Gy/5wks’ and ‘15fr/2.66Gy/3wks’ respectively. While CF and HF for ProRT where ’39fr/2Gy/9wks’ and ‘20fr/3Gy/4wks’ respectively. The cost of each protocol was estimated using IAEA RTE cost estimator. Current RT coverage (%Cv.) of each African country with RT unit is computed based on their number of EBRT unit obtained from the IAEA directory. The %Cv. is based on IAEA recommendation of 1 EBRT unit per 250,000 population. This %Cv. enable us to quantify the number of patients that currently have access to CF-RT, by which we were able to project the potential changes in access that would occur in each country at their global adoption of HF protocols. Potential cost-savings over a 7-year period (2019-2025) is analyzed as the difference between the estimated cost of full coverage for all RT indications using CF and that estimated by using the HF. Our analysis required estimates on the number of breast and prostate cancer cases that would require RT in each country overtime, which we computed by multiplying their GLOBOCAN incidence projections by the RT utilization rates. Results: The adoption of HF protocol is expected to increase the treatment capacity of RT centers across Africa. A single EBRT department capable of delivering 388 WBRT courses and 249 ProRT courses at the CF scheme will deliver 647 WBRT courses and 485 ProRT courses at HF. HF implementation would lead to an increase in RT access ranging from +3% to +439% for WBRT and +4.2% to +623.4% for ProRT. Patients in low population countries and countries with already well-established RT programs will experience the highest increment in RT access. Full HF implementation will minimize the cost of treating all WBRT and ProRT cases by 40% and 51% respectively. This will save the continent a total of $1.1bn and $605m for WBRT and ProRT respectively. Conclusion: Evidence-based HF can increase the treatment capacity of LMIC RT departments without compromising quality and thus, requires further research on its implementation. There is potential to expand LMIC RT access through the adoption of HF schemes as the new standard. Innovations to progressively reduce fraction may become a new paradigm in global radiation oncology."
"Ishaq, O., et al.",2016,Establishing risk factors for radiation-related fatigue in early-stage breast cancer patients enrolled in a large prospective cohort.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Fatigue, a common side effect reported by early stage breast cancer (ESBC) patients, negatively impacts quality of life, productivity, and even cancer therapy. Radiation therapy (RT) in women with ESBC after breast conserving surgery (BCS) causes fatigue. However, there is a paucity of prospective data, limiting prevalence estimates and risk factor characterization, hindering physicians' ability to counsel and treat patients. We evaluated the prevalence, kinetics, and risk factors of RT-related fatigue in a large, prospective cohort of women with ESBC who underwent BCS and adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast RT. Materials/Methods: Four hundred patients with stage 0-II ESBC that underwent BCS with nodal assessment were enrolled onto a prospective, institutional randomized trial Patients received 40.5 Gy to the whole breast in 3 weeks with either a concomitant daily (0.5 Gy) or weekly (2 Gy) tumor bed boost. Patients completed the SF36 vitality scale (VS), a validated fatigue inventory prior to RT, end of RT, and 1 month after RT completion. Raw VS scores were converted to a 0-100 point scale. Normbased (NB) VS scores (Mean 50, SD +-10) were also calculated. For each time point, univariate analysis for continuous variables was analyzed using t-test and ANOVA. Longitudinal multivariate testing used ANCOVA and MANCOVA for repeated measures. Results: On univariate analysis chemotherapy (CTX) (P<0.0001) was the only variable significantly associated with greater fatigue at all time points and remained so on multivariate analysis. Anxiety was significant pre-RT and at 1 month follow-up (f/u) while depression was significant at only 1 month f/u. Insomnia was significant pre-RT and at end of RT. Study arm, menopausal status, race, tumor laterality, hypothyroidism, and BMI were not associated with fatigue scores at any time point. Repeated measures analysis of scaled and NB scores showed significant improvement with time (P<0.0001) and CTX (P<0.0001) on fatigue scores as well as significant interaction between the two factors (P<0.001). Mean scaled fatigue scores for patients who received CTX and those who did not were 47.1 and 63.49 pre-RT, 54.50 and 61.57 post-RT, and 59.34 and 62.87 at 1 month f/u, respectively. NBS fatigue score means were 44.39 and 52.58 pre-RT, 48.09 and 51.62 post-RT, and 50.51 and 52.27 at 1 month f/u for those receiving and not receiving CTX, respectively. Conclusion: Adjuvant CTX is the greatest pretreatment predictor of fatigue in patients undergoing hypofractionated RT after BCS for ESBC. Patients who received CTX had lower fatigue scores that improved significantly throughout and after RT. In contrast, patients without CTX had mean fatigue scores decrease slightly by end of RT that returned to baseline 1 month after RT completion."
"Ishaq, O., et al.",2015,Effect of treatment time of day on radiation fatigue and toxicity in early-stage breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The time of day radiation therapy is delivered has been shown to impact acute toxicity in H&N and pelvic malignancies. However, little is known about the effect of radiation treatment time (RTT) on acute radiation toxicity in breast cancer. Fatigue and dermatitis are common side-effects of breast radiation therapy that influence patient's quality of life; we hypothesize that they could be dependent on circadian rhythm and be impacted by time of daily treatments. Materials/Methods: Four hundred patients with stage 0-II breast cancer that underwent partial mastectomy and nodal assessment and enrolled onto a prospective, randomized institutional RT trial were analyzed. Patients received 40.5 Gy over three weeks to the whole breast with either a concomitant daily (0.5 Gy) or weekly (2 Gy) tumor bed boost. Acute skin toxicity was graded by RTOG toxicity criteria weekly and at 1 month follow up. Patients completed the SF-36 vitality subscale pretreatment, at the end of treatment, and at 1 month follow up visit. Subscale sums were converted to a 100 point fatigue score for analysis. Individual treatment times were recorded by the LINAC record verifier, documenting exact “beam on” start times. Patients were classified into one of three RTT groups based on the time the majority of their treatment sessions (>75%) had occurred: before 12:00pm (morning), between 12:00-3pm (mid-afternoon), and after 3pm (late afternoon), respectively. Patient characteristics, fatigue scores, and acute toxicity were compared between groups using the Chi Square and ANOVA tests. Results: One hundred forty patients received treatment in the morning, 63 in the mid-afternoon, and 86 in the late afternoon. Patient characteristics including menopausal status, performance status, BMI, history of depression, and women who received chemotherapy or anti-hormonal therapy were well balanced between the cohorts. No difference between RTT groups in pre-treatment (p = 0.57), end of treatment (p = 0.84), or one month (p=0.32) fatigue scores could be detected. Similarly, no statistically significant difference in incidence of acute radiation dermatitis was seen (p=0.39). Conclusion: We investigated whether the radiation treatment time of day would correlate with the incidence of acute effects like clinical fatigue or skin toxicity in breast cancer patients and failed to detect a statistically significant difference for radiation received in the morning, mid-afternoon, or late afternoon.

"Ivaldi, G. B., et al.",2008,Preliminary Results of Electron Intraoperative Therapy Boost and Hypofractionated External Beam Radiotherapy After Breast-Conserving Surgery in Premenopausal Women.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To report the acute and preliminary data on late toxicity of a pilot study of boost with electron intraoperative therapy followed by hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy (HEBRT) of the whole breast. Methods and Materials: Between June 2004 and March 2007, 211 women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery. During surgery, an electron intraoperative therapy boost of 12 Gy was administered to the tumor bed. Adjuvant local treatment was completed with HEBRT, consisting of a course of 13 daily fractions of 2.85 Gy to the whole breast to a total dose of 37.05 Gy. Acute toxicity of the breast was evaluated at the end of HEBRT and at 1 month of follow-up. Late toxicity was recorded at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Results: We report the data from 204 patients. The maximal acute skin toxicity was observed at the end of HEBRT (182 patients evaluable) with 7 (3.8%) Grade 3, 52 (28.6%) Grade 2, 123 (67.6%) Grade 1, and no Grade 0 or Grade 4 cases. A total of 108 patients were evaluated for late toxicity. The recorded late skin toxicity was Grade 4 in 1 patient (0.9%), Grade 3 in 1 patient, and Grade 2 or less in 106 patients (98.2%). Conclusions: The results of this study have shown that electron intraoperative therapy followed by HEBRT allows for the delivery of a high dose to the tumor bed and an adequate dose to the whole breast. This treatment is feasible, compliance is high, and the rate of acute toxicity and the preliminary data on chronic toxicity seem acceptable.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Jagsi, R., et al.",2019,Planned Interim Analysis Results from a Prospective Multicenter Single-Arm Cohort Study of Patients Receiving Endocrine Therapy but Not Radiotherapy after Breast-Conserving Surgery for Early-Stage Breast Cancer with Favorable Biologic Features.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Concerns about toxicity, burden, and expense motivate research to identify patients with low absolute risk of recurrence after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) who may choose to omit adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), even if they are younger than those studied in CALGB 9343 or PRIME II. Genomic assays developed for overall prognosis and prediction of impact of systemic therapies may have utility in this setting, and prospective trials are underway. We sought to evaluate outcomes after omission of RT among patients enrolled on a prospective single-arm multicenter trial. Materials/Methods: At 13 US institutions, as part of an IRB-approved multicenter trial, we recruited women for participation in a single-arm cohort trial of omission of RT after BCS. Eligible patients were postmenopausal and aged 50-69. They were limited to those with Stage I unifocal invasive breast cancer s/p BCS with ≥2mm negative margins, pT1N0 with ER+, PR+, and Her2-, and Oncotype-DX recurrence score ≤18. Patients consented to pursue at least 5 years of endocrine therapy and surveillance on study without adjuvant RT. A planned interim analysis after 400 person-years of follow-up was conducted to confirm, using a Bayesian statistical design, that accumulating data do not suggest with high confidence that the 5- year LRR is 6% or greater. Results: 200 eligible patients enrolled between 06/15 and 10/18. At 400 person-years of follow-up in 02/19, no disease recurrences (at any site) or patient deaths had been observed. Eleven patients (5.5%) had discontinued endocrine therapy prior to the 5 years of therapy planned. Conclusion: In this first report of a U.S. multicenter study using a genomic assay to select low-risk patients for omission of RT, no concerning findings emerged. Locoregional failure did not occur, and the vast majority of patients continued taking prescribed endocrine therapy. Moreover, accrual occurred as targeted, suggesting patient and provider interest in this approach. Long-term follow-up of this cohort and continued accrual to similar trials is important."
"Janni, W., et al.",2000,Radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer: Impact on local recurrence and overall survival.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Introduction: Recent studies have renewed an old controversy about the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy following mastectomy for breast cancer. Radiotherapy is usually recommended for advanced disease, but whether or not to use it in pT1-T2 pN0 situations is still being debated. This study was designed to clarify whether or not routine radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy reduces the risk of local recurrence and if it influences the overall survival rate. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients treated with mastectomy for pT1-T2 pN0 tumors and no systemic treatment. Patients treated with radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy (Group A) are compared with those treated with mastectomy alone (Group B). Results: A total of 918 patients underwent mastectomy. Patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy after mastectomy (n = 114) had a significantly lower risk for local recurrence. Ten years after the primary diagnosis, 98.1% of the patients with radiotherapy were disease free compared to 86.4% of the patients without radiotherapy. The average time interval from primary diagnosis until local recurrence was 8.9 years in Group A and 2.8 years in Group B. The Cox regression analysis including radiotherapy, tumor size and tumor grading found the highest risk for local recurrence for patients without radiotherapy (p < 0.0004). In terms of overall survival however, the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference between the two groups (p = 0.8787) and the Cox regression analysis failed to show any impact on overall survival. Conclusion: With observation spanning over 35 years, this study shows that adjuvant radiotherapy of the chest wall following mastectomy reduces the risk for local recurrence in node-negative patients with pT1-T2 tumors but has no impact on the overall survival rate.

"Jeon, S. H., et al.",2017,Seroma change during magnetic resonance imaging-guided partial breast irradiation and its clinical implications.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate the patterns of post-lumpectomy seroma volume (SV) change and related clinical factors to determine the benefits of adaptive planning in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided partial breast irradiation (PBI). Purpose/Objective(s): MRI data obtained from 37 women with early breast cancer acquired at simulation and at the 1st, 6th, and 10th fractions were analyzed. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as unequal margins of 10-15 mm added according to the directional surgical margin status of each seroma. Treatment was performed using a 0.35T MRI-guided radiotherapy system. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the correlations between SV change rate and clinical factors. Seroma and PTV for adaptive planning were based on the images obtained at the 6th fraction. Results: The average time intervals between surgery-simulation, simulation-1st, 1st-6th, and 6th-10th fractions were 23.1, 8.5, 7.2, and 5.9 days, respectively. Of the 37 patients, 33 exhibited decreased SV over the treatment period. The mean SV of these 33 patients decreased from 100% at simulation to 60%, 48%, and 40% at each MRI scan. In most cases (26/33), the logarithm of SV was inversely proportional to the elapsed time from surgery (R2>0.90, Pearson's correlation test). The volume of spared normal tissue from adaptive radiotherapy was proportional to the absolute change in SV (R2=0.89, Pearson's correlation test). Conclusion: Seromas exhibit exponential shrinkage over the course of PBI. In patients receiving PBI, frequent monitoring of SV could be helpful in decision-making regarding adaptive planning, especially those with a large seroma."
"Jethwa, K. R., et al.",2017,Catheter-based accelerated partial breast brachytherapy results in excellent patient-reported quality of life.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and whole breast radiotherapy (WBR) are treatment options for early stage breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported-outcomes (PRO) between patients receiving APBI or WBR. Purpose/Objective(s): 197 chronologically matched patients (pts) with low risk, early stage breast cancer were treated with either APBI or WBR between October 2012 and May 2015. The Linear Analog 10-point Scales (LASA), Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS), and Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale (HBCS) were used to assess overall quality of life (LASA), pain (LASA, BCTOS), fatigue (LASA), perceived aesthetic and functional status (BCTOS, LASA), and breast cosmesis (BCTOS, HBCS). Comparisons of PROs between treatment groups were performed using Fisher exact test, chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and regression methods. Results: Survey compliance was 66% (64 APBI and 67 WBR pts). Median follow-up was 13.3 months, with a mean interval between the last fraction and survey completion of 15.4 v 14.2 months (p=0.58), for the APBI and WBR groups, respectively. The majority of respondents had grade 1-2 (86%), T1 (92%), and N0 (93%) in-situ or invasive ductal carcinoma. Pts treated with WBR were more likely to be younger (median 65 v 69 yrs, p=0.02), have T2 tumors (15% v 2%, p=0.01), and to receive chemotherapy (21% v 2%, p<0.001). In the WBR group, the median dose delivered was 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions, with 54% of pts receiving a lumpectomy cavity boost (median dose 10 Gy). In the APBI group, the median dose delivered was 34 Gy in 10 twice daily fractions utilizing an intraoperatively-placed high dose rate brachytherapy applicator. There was no difference in overall quality of life (8.5 v 8.9, p=0.14), pain (2.1 v 2.1, p=0.21) or fatigue (3.0 v 3.0, p=0.21) between the APBI and WBR groups, respectively. The mean overall BCTOS (31.6 v 34.3, p=0.52) was similar between groups, as was the BCTOS overall cosmetic status, and individual cosmetic measures including breast size, nipple appearance, breast shape, and breast heaviness (all p>0.05). Individual BCTOS functional measures, including arm heaviness, breast/arm swelling, arm/shoulder range of motion, and joint stiffness were similar between groups, all p>0.05. A higher proportion of pts receiving WBR reported breast elevation (slight: 33% v 16%, moderate: 25% v 8%, p=0.01). Skin color change relative to baseline was also more common in the WBR group (p=0.01), with a trend towards greater telangiectasia formation (p=0.053). For the APBI and WBR groups, most pts reported excellent (48% v 54%) or good (41 v 40%) cosmesis, with no difference between groups (p=0.37). Conclusion: APBI and WBR are associated with excellent and comparable 1-year PROs. In this sample, APBI resulted in a lesser degree of patient-reported breast elevation and skin color change relative to baseline."
"Jhawar, S. R., et al.",2019,Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Alone is Associated with Improved Overall Survival Compared to Hormonal Therapy Alone in Elderly Women with Favorable Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Lumpectomy and hormonal therapy (HT) without radiation therapy (RT) is an accepted approach for elderly women with early stage estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. However, compliance with HT may be poor due to toxicity. Adjuvant RT alone may have better compliance, but its role in the absence of HT is unclear. This study assesses patterns of adjuvant therapy and compares survival outcomes among women receiving HT alone, RT alone, or both. Materials/Methods: This observational cohort study used the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) to identify women age ≥65 years with invasive ER+, T1, node negative, and unilateral breast cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2015. All patients underwent lumpectomy with negative margins. Patients treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy were excluded. Use of HT and RT was assessed over time, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations with treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of treatment with 5 and 10-year overall survival (OS) from surgery, adjusting for patient, facility, and tumor covariates. Results: The cohort included 130,194 women who met the study criteria. Of these, 12.8% (n=16,689) received no adjuvant treatment, 18.1% (n=23,548) received HT alone, 14.0% (n=18,220) received RT alone, and 55.1% (n=71,737) received HT and RT. The use of HT alone increased over the study period, from 10.6% in 2004 to 23.9% in 2015 (p<0.001), while the use of RT alone decreased from 25.6% to 8.5% (p<0.001). Compared to patients who received both HT and RT, older patients and patients treated at an academic facility were more likely to receive single-modality therapy (HT alone or RT alone), while patients with higher grade tumors and lobular histology were less likely to receive single-modality treatment. RT alone was less common and HT alone was more common with greater distance from the reporting facility (>50 vs. ≤50 miles) and later year of diagnosis. Patients with higher Charlson-Deyo co-morbidity score (≥2 vs. 0-1) were more likely to receive HT alone (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-1.62). Unadjusted 5/10-year OS rates were 90.0%/64.3% for HT and RT, 84.2%/54.9% for RT alone, 78.7%/44.5% for HT alone, and 71.6%/38.0% for no treatment; p=<0.001. Compared to patients receiving HT and RT, the 10-year multivariable hazard ratio (HR) for death for RT alone was 1.28 (95% CI 1.22-1.34) and for HT alone was 1.49 (95% CI 1.42-1.55). Conclusion: Elderly women with early stage ER+ breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and received HT and RT had the best survival. Assessment of single-modality therapy showed that RT alone had higher rates of OS at 5 and 10 years compared to HT alone. This finding persisted after adjusting for patient, facility, and tumor covariates. These data support the prospective evaluation of RT alone vs. HT alone in this patient population."
"Jing, H., et al.",2016,"Adjuvant trastuzumab reduces locoregional recurrence in women who receive mastectomy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer without radiation therapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients (pts) with Her2+ breast cancer fare poor prognosis, but anti-Her2 target therapy improves outcomes. Her2+ as a risk factor for considering postmastectomy radiation therapy is evolving in target therapy era. We retrospectively analyzed a group of Her2+ pts with mastectomy to evaluate if anti-Her2 therapy can reduce locoregional recurrence (LRR). Materials/Methods: By using an institutional database, non-metastatic, non-inflammatory, early stage Her2+ (IHC 3+ or FISH amplification) pts, who received mastectomy and without radiation therapy were identified. Reported risks associated with LRR were analyzed by binary logistic regression. Locoregional recurrence free survival (LRRFS) were calculated and compared by Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests. Cox regression was used to estimate associated covariables. Results: From January 1998 to December 2014, 646 pts were eligible. One hundred ninety-six pts received adjuvant trastuzumab concurrently or sequentially with adjuvant chemotherapy and 442 did not. The pts characteristics are shown in Table 1. With a median follow up of 51 months (0-191 months), recurrences occurred in 65 pts (10.1%), with local relapse, regional relapse, locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis in 11(1.7%), 27(4.2%), 33(5.1%) and 51(7.9%) pts respectively. Logistic regression revealed that absence of trastuzumab was significantly associated with increased LRR (HR 4.2, 95% CI 1.62-10.86, P = 0.003). Other factors associated with LRR were lymph-vascular space invasion, pathologic N stage, and pathologic tumor size. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-y LRRFS rates were 98.8% and 91.6% for pts with and without trastuzumab (Log-rank test: P = 0.008), and were 100 vs 92.3% (n = 198, P = 0.047), 98.3 vs 93.1% (n = 246, P = 0.14) and 96.3 vs 90.7% (n = 165, P = 0.34) for AJCC7th stage IA, IB + IIA and IIB pts with and without trastuzumab, respectively. Cox regression analysis also confirmed that anti-Her2 target therapy was an independent favorable factor for LRRFS (OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.02-19.93, P = 0.048). (Table presented) Conclusion: Trastuzumab in Her2+ early stage breast cancer is an independent favorable factor for LRRFS. Given the low LRR rates with trastuzumab in our results, for a subgroup of pts with intermediate risk after mastectomy and chemotherapy, radiation therapy may be reserved only for pts who decline trastuzumab for social-economic reasons."
"Jolly, S., et al.",2006,The impact of lobular carcinoma in situ in association with invasive breast cancer on the rate of local recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The significance of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) associated with invasive breast cancer in patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) remains controversial. We examined the impact of the presence and extent of LCIS associated with invasive breast cancer on clinical outcome in BCT patients. Methods and Materials: From 1980 to 1996, 607 cases of invasive breast cancer were treated with BCT. All slides were reviewed by a single pathologist. Positive margin was defined as presence of invasive carcinoma/ductal carcinoma in situ at the inked margin. Multiple clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related variables were analyzed for their association with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and true recurrence/marginal miss (TR/MM). Median follow-up was 8.7 years. Results: Fifty-six patients (9%) had LCIS in association with invasive cancer. On univariate analysis, positive final margin, positive/no reexcision, smaller maximum specimen dimension, and the presence of LCIS predicted for IBTR. The 10-year IBTR rate was 14% for cases with LCIS vs. 7% without LCIS (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, positive margin (p < 0.01), positive/no reexcision (p = 0.04), and presence of LCIS (p = 0.02) remained independently associated with IBTR; positive margin (p < 0.01) and LCIS (p = 0.04) were also associated with TR/MM failure. When examining only cases with negative final margins, the presence of LCIS remained associated with higher IBTR and TR/MM rates (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The presence of LCIS was independently associated with higher rate of IBTR and TR/MM after BCT for invasive breast cancer. LCIS may have significant premalignant potential and progress to an invasive IBTR at the site of index lesion. The adequacy of excision of LCIS associated with invasive carcinoma should be considered in patients undergoing BCT.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Jorda, E., et al.",2019,Hypofractionated Versus Conventionally Fractioned Breast Radiotherapy: Economic Consequences.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated radiotherapy for post-operative breast cancer has consolidated as the standard treatment for breast cancer due to best results compared with mastectomy in terms of local relapse, disease recurrence and survival rates. On clinical trials, multiples fractionated schemes have been tested in the past years, demonstrating that hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation was not inferior to standard radiation treatment in women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer with clear surgical margins and negative axillary nodes. The purpose of this study was to compare the economic outcomes in our institution resulting from an hypofractionated treatment in selected patients. Materials/Methods: A retrospective review from 2010 to 2018 of hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation was performed. Inclusion criteria was: early breast cancer (I, II), breast-conserving surgery and negative axillary nodes. 3D conformal radiotherapy was delivered with 6-15 MV photons: 40,05 Gy in 15 fractions, 5 fractions per week. Additionally, boost doses to the tumor bed in patients <50 years old, close margins of IDC or positive margins on DCIS with an equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) of 10-20Gy. The estimated cost by treatment was obtained multiplying the number of sessions received by the stipulated cost of each session according to the law in force. Additionally, we calculated an estimated cost of the treatment as if it has been performed with conventionally fractionated schedule, comparing the total amount between treatments. Results: Nine hundred twenty patients were treated in our institution using hypofractionated schemes. The cost by session was estimated in 317,48 euros according with the law in force provided by the economic department of our institution. 70,6% (n650) of patients received 15 fractions with an estimated cost by treatment of 3.095.430 euros and the remain 29,4% of patients (n270) received 18 fractions with an estimated cost of 1.542.952,8 euros. Comparing a standard irradiation in 25 fractions with hypofractionated irradiation in 15 fractions, a total saving estimated on 2.063.620 euros was obtained. Likewise, in patients who underwent boost doses to the tumor bed receiving 18 fractions, a total saving of 1.028.635,2 euros was calculated compared to a conventional treatment of 30 fractions. The total saving estimated all the patients was 3.092.255,2 euros. Conclusion: The increasing demand of treatments in health care institutions makes necessary the implementation of cost-efficacy strategies, in attendance of each patients needs without letting aside the importance of optimization of health resources. Hypofractionated schedules reduce the total time of treatments which translates in a reduction of sanitary personnel costs, machine times, waiting lists, transportation and patient discomfort among others."
"Joslyn, S. A.",1999,Radiation therapy and patient age in the survival from early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To analyze the use of radiation therapy following local excision of invasive localized breast cancer and subsequent survival by 5- year age category. Methods: Data for 27, 399 women diagnosed with localized stage of breast cancer and treated with local excision surgery from 1983 through 1992 were collected and provided by the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Use of radiation therapy was analyzed by race, ethnic background, geographic location, and age at diagnosis. Survival for women treated with local excision plus radiation therapy was compared to that of women treated with local excision alone for each 5-year age category. Results: Subjects in older age groups were significantly less likely (p < 0.001) to receive radiation following local excision compared to younger age groups. Statistically significant survival advantages were conferred on women receiving radiation therapy in each 5- year age category from age 35 to 84 years (ranging from p = 0.02 to p < 0.0001). Conclusion: While the use of radiation therapy following local excision of early-stage breast tumors drops significantly in older age groups, women aged 35-84 years receiving radiation therapy had significant reductions in mortality. These results did not appear to be influenced by the presence of mortal comorbid conditions. These results strongly suggest the need to consider carefully patient characteristics other than age in deciding the course of treatment for early-stage breast cancer."
"Kacinski, B. M., et al.",1999,Signal transduction pathways regulated by CSF-1 receptors modulate the in vitro radiosensitivity of mammary epithelial cells.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: CSF-1 and its receptor have both been previously implicated in the basic biology and clinical course of mammary and female reproductive tract neoplasms. A recent study (1) demonstrated that expression of this receptor correlated with local relapse in early-stage breast cancer patients. In this communication, we investigated the role that this receptor/ligand pair plays in modulating cellular responses to ionizing radiation in a mammary epithelial cell line HC11.Methods and Materials: The radiosensitivity of HC11 clonal cells transfected to overexpress either the wild-type CSF-1 receptor or CSF-1 receptor mutated at one of the two major autophosphorylation sites (TYR → PHE 807 or TYR → PHE 721) was quantitated by standard in vitro clonogenic assays.Results: We demonstrated that a signal transduction pathway regulated by the phosphorylation of TYR-807 of CSF-1 receptor appears to play a major role in controlling the radiosensitivity of murine mammary epithelial cells.Conclusions: Our observations offer insights into potential pharmacologic and gene-therapeutic approaches for the modification of radiation response of mammary neoplasms.

"Kader, H. A., et al.",2008,When Is CT-Based Postoperative Seroma Most Useful to Plan Partial Breast Radiotherapy? Evaluation of Clinical Factors Affecting Seroma Volume and Clarity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of the time from surgery and other clinical factors on seroma volume and clarity and establish the optimal time to use the computed tomography (CT)-based seroma to plan partial breast irradiation (PBI). Methods and Materials: A total of 205 women with early-stage breast cancer underwent planning CT after breast-conserving surgery. One radiation oncologist contoured the seroma volume and scored the seroma clarity, using a standardized Seroma Clarity Score scale, from 0 (not detectable) to 5 (clearest). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between the seroma characteristics and the interval from surgery and other clinical factors. Results: The mean interval from surgery to CT was 84 days (standard deviation 59). During postoperative Weeks 3-8, the mean seroma volume decreased from 47 to 30 cm3, stabilized during Weeks 9-14 (mean 21) and was involuted beyond 14 weeks (mean 9 cm3). The mean seroma clarity score was 3.4 at Weeks 3-8, 2.5 at Weeks 9-14, and 1.6 after 14 weeks. The seroma clarity was greater in patients aged ≥70 years. The seroma volume and clarity correlated significantly with the volume of excised breast tissue but not with the maximal tumor diameter, surgical re-excision, or chemotherapy use. Conclusion: The optimal time to obtain the planning CT scan for PBI is within 8 weeks after surgery. During Weeks 9-14, the seroma might remain adequately defined in some patients; however, after 14 weeks, alternate strategies are needed to identify the PBI target. The lack of correlation between the seroma volume and tumor size suggests that the CT-based seroma should not be the sole guide for PBI target volume definition.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Kagami, Y., et al.",2011,Prospective trial of accelerated partial breast irradiation with once-a-day treatment in early stage breast cancer: Report of short-term outcome.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Based on favorable early clinical outcome data, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is increasingly being offered as an alternative to conventional external beam whole breast irradiation following lumpectomy in early-stage breast cancer patients. However, there has been little treatment report to the Asian patients.We present our clinical trial utilizing 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to deliver APBI in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving therapy. Evaluation of safety and efficacy of APBI of 3DCRT for Japanese patients with breast cancer were endpoints of the study. Materials/Methods: Between Jan. 2008 and Jan. 2010, 73 patients with Stage 0-2 breast cancer were enrolled at National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan, institutional review board-approved. Eligibility criteria included 3cm and less of pathological tumor size, invasive ductal and lobular histologies as well as ductal carcinoma in situ, negative surgical margins, ≤3 positive axillary nodes, unifocal lesion, and written patients consent. Patients receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. The clinical target volume consisted of the lumpectomy cavity with surgical clips plus a 10 mm margin. The prescribed dose was 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions given over 2 weeks. All patients were treated once a day. Results: The median follow-up after radiotherapy was 25 month (range, 6-38 months). The clinical stage distribution was as follows: 0 in 10 patients, 1 in 50, and 2 in 13. The median tumor size was 16 mm (range, 2-30 mm). The median age was 60 year (range, 32-79 year). 18 patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy before APBI. Almost all acute adverse effects were Grade 0 or Grade 1. One patient had symptomatic pneumonitis (Grade 2). Grade 1 subcutaneous induration was 26 %. Two patients developed recurrence with 1 axillary lymph node recurrence at 12 months and 1 breast recurrence at 34 months. Cosmetic results were rated as good/excellent in 96% of patients. Conclusions: 3D-CRT for APBI is feasible for Japanese breast cancer patients in a median 25 months follow up."
"Karasawa, K., et al.",2011,Comparison between hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation in early breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We have conducted a clinical trial to evaluate whether the hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) is equally effective and safe with conventional fractionated whole-breast irradiation (CF-WBI). Materials/Methods: The patients with Stage 0 to II of breast cancer, after partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary node dissection, positive lymph nodes less than 3, and no concurrent chemotherapy were eligible for this study. Prior to the treatment, all patients were explained about the two treatment schedules and they decided by their free selection. The HF-WBI consisted of 43.2 Gy/16f to the whole breast with additional tumor bed boost of 8.1 Gy/3f for positive or less than 5mm surgical margins. The CF-WBI consisted of 50 Gy/25f to the whole breast with additional tumor bed boost of 10 Gy/5f for positive or less than 5mm surgical margins or 6 Gy/3f in negative surgical margins which has been our standard of care. All breasts were irradiated with 4 MV photon of Varian 21EX, tangential fields using electronic tissue compensation of Eclipse with a radiation dose homogeneity within ± 7%. The acute adverse effects were observed weekly during treatment and 1 and 2 weeks after the completion of treatment. The late adverse effects have been observed every 6 months after the treatment and scored by CTCAE v3.0. Results: From April 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010, 1100 cases were registered and 1130 breasts were treated. The age ranged from 22 to 88 with median of 54. The clinical stage was Stage 0 in 194, Stage 1 in 542, Stage IIa in 302 and Stage IIb in 92. Among them, 736 cases (65%) selected HF-WBI and 318 cases (35%) selected CF-WBI. The cases with positive or close tumor margins were 237 cases (32%) in HF-WBI and 156 cases (40%) in CF-WBI. Grade 2 acute skin reactions were observed in 24 cases (3%) in HF-WBI and 53 cases (14%) in CF-WBI (p<0.001). The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 61 months with the median of 27 months. Radiation pneumonitis was observed in 4 cases (0.5%) of HF-WBI and 2 cases (0.5%) of CF-WBI. No other late adverse effect above Grade 2 has been observed in both treatment arms. Two cases of intra-breast tumor recurrence were observed in each treatment arm and intra-breast tumor control rates were 99.7% in HF-WBI and 99.4% in CF-WBI. Regional lymph node recurrence was observed in 1 case of HF-WBI and 2 cases of CF-WBI and distant metastasis was observed in 8 cases of HF-WBI and 3 cases of CF-WBI. Three cases of breast cancer mortality were observed in HF-WBI. Conclusions: The HF-WBI is superior for less acute skin reaction in our radiation technique. In short-term results, we might conclude that HF-WBI has almost the same effectiveness and safety as CF-WBI. Longer follow-up must be needed to obtain final conclusions."
"Kataria, S., et al.",2019,Robotic Stereotactic Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: 5-Year Results of a Single-Institution Pilot Study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Outcomes following adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in select women with early stage breast cancer are comparable to whole breast irradiation. Robotic stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation (SAPBI) with fiducial tracking is an attractive treatment option, but limited data are available regarding the feasibility of this approach and 5 year outcomes have not yet been published. We report our institutional experience treating select women with SAPBI. Materials/Methods: Women with DCIS and early stage breast cancer treated from November 2008 to September 2015 were evaluated. Treatments were delivered with a robotic radiosurgical system. At least 4 gold fiducials were implanted around the lumpectomy cavity prior to the start of treatment for target tracking. The CTV was delineated on contrast enhanced CT scans using surgical clips and the lumpectomy cavity. In 2014, following the publication of the University of Florence phase III trial, the protocol was amended after 13 patients and the CTV was defined as the lumpectomy cavity with a uniform 1 cm expansion confined to the breast tissue. The PTV, prescribed 30 Gy in 5 fractions, was defined as the CTV with a 3-5 mm uniform expansion. AAPM TG-101 skin dose constraints were respected. Clinical examination and mammography were completed at 6-12 month follow up intervals. Breast cosmesis was scored using The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Grading Scale. Results: Twenty women (median age 65 years) were treated over a median 7 days (range 5-13). Fourteen women had DCIS and 50% of the tumors were located in the upper outer quadrant. The median treated PTV was 63 cm3 (range 15-142), the median PTV/breast volume ratio was 8.3% (range 4.1-25.6) and the median prescription isodose line was 83% (range 75-87). Three or 4 fiducials were successfully tracked in 90% of patients. At a median follow up of 60 months (range 33-108), locoregional control, distant control, and overall survival was 100%. Five women with skin Dmax > 33 Gy (skin = CT surface minus 2 mm) developed chronic grade 1 dermatitis (faint hyperpigmentation), one of whom developed focal grade 1 telangiectasia at 52 months. Three women developed grade 1 fibrosis, one of whom was later diagnosed with fat necrosis on mammography. Two additional asymptomatic women were diagnosed with fat necrosis on routine mammography. There were no rib fractures. One woman required stereotactic biopsy to confirm benign tumor bed calcifications at 66 months. Fifteen evaluable patients maintained Good-Excellent cosmesis. Conclusion: Robotic SAPBI with fiducial tracking is a feasible, well tolerated and highly effective technique for the adjuvant treatment of select early-stage breast cancer patients. Cosmetic outcomes may be improved further by decreasing the skin Dmax to < 33 Gy. A confirmatory multi-institutional registry is actively enrolling patients. Given these encouraging results, future research in this patient population will evaluate robotic SAPBI as a definitive treatment."
"Kato, M., et al.",2014,Evaluating radiation dose to the heart and the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery with left whole-breast radiation therapy to Japanese women.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Exposure of the heart to ionizing radiation during radiation therapy for breast cancer increases the subsequent rate of ischemic heart disease caused by coronary stenosis. To evaluate the radiation doses received by the heart and the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery with tangential breast radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Fifty five consecutive patients with left-sided early stage breast cancer treated with conservative treatment at our institution from March to December in 2013 were analyzed. We used three-dimensional CT-based dosimetry methods with superposition algorithm to estimate dose and volume irradiated for the heart and the LAD. All patients were planned for treatment with whole breast radiation therapy consisting of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, with or without tumor bed boost. They were treated with 5 days per week, using 6 MV photons. These of 17 patients were added tumor bed boost with 10 Gy in 5 fractions, using 9 or 12 MeV electrons. Whole breast as CTV was required from 95 to 107% tumor dose and left lung was under 20% volume of V20 Gy. Results: The average mean dose of the heart was 1.28 Gy (range 0.510- 3.70 Gy, median 1.20 Gy) and of the LAD coronary artery was 10.7 Gy (range 1.70-28.3 Gy, median 9.36 Gy). Correlations were found between the mean dose of the heart and the LAD (r=0.724, p10 Gy (20% of tumor dose) mean dose to the LAD, the LAD radial margins were outside the volume of the heart and inside pericardium and pericardial fat tissue. This meant that the LAD coronary artery contour was closer to the fields than the heart was, or in the fields for most part of LAD and it therefore received higher doses than the heart. For 15 patients received > 15 Gy (30% of tumor dose) mean dose, distal part of the LAD was in the fields. For tumor bed boost irradiation in 17 patients, average mean dose of the heart and the LAD a little increased 0.353 Gy and 1.51 Gy, respectively. Therefore, this study assessed heart and LAD dose from tangential fields and nodal irradiation and did not consider tumor bed boost. Conclusions: The average heart mean dose was 1.28 Gy of 2.56% tumor dose and LAD mean dose was 10.7 Gy of 21.4% tumor dose. Correlations are found between the mean dose of the heart and the LAD. To avoid irrelevant excess doses of the LAD, cover the LAD or contour the heart volume including all heart with pericardium enough and also pericardial fat tissue are recommended."
"Kawamura, M., et al.",2015,"Ultrasonography, mammography, and MRI changes after intraoperative radiation therapy of breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): There are very limited reports evaluating changes of tumor bed after intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) of breast conserving surgery for the early breast cancer. Few reports exist focused on ultrasonography (US) and mammography (MMG) findings in contrast to external whole breast irradiation. However, gray scale US and MMG contain very limited information thus the changes to mammary gland, skin, and soft tissue including fat and connective tissue after IORT are still unclear. In this study, we report MRI change of 5-year follow up in contrast to time-dependent changes of US and MMG after IORT. Materials/Methods: Early breast cancer women accepted to participate in our institutional phase I/II trial of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using IORT were recruited and only the patients with annual US, MMG, and 5-year follow up MRI were eligible for the evaluation. For IORT, a single 21-Gy dose was delivered to the tumor bed using 6 to 12 MeV electron after wide local excision of the primary breast cancer. Prior to the irradiation, 8-10cm diameters and 1cm thick shielding plate was placed behind the breast tissue to spare unnecessary dose to the heart and lung. Annual US exam included colored-Doppler of the tumor bed in addition to the gray scale to capture the vessel lesions, and MMG was performed on the same day as US. Contrast-enhanced MRI was achieved in the fifth year of follow up using 3-T MRI in prone position for the evaluation. Results: Of 32 patients who were recruited for the IORT phase I/II trial, 5 had annual US, MMG, and 5-year follow up MRI. All are alive with no local and distant recurrences. Seroma or hematoma was captured in all patients at first year follow up US. The size of the hematomas or seroma decreased at 3rd year follow up US in four patients. Vascularity was absent around tumor bed throughout the five-year follow up in all patients. Calcification in MMG was captured in 2 patients at 3rd year follow up and 1 patient at 4th year follow up which lead to the diagnosis of fat necrosis of the tumor bed. Of 3 patients with fat necrosis, 2 had strong pulling of the skin and had fair cosmetic outcome. The patients with strong skin pull had continuous low T2 signal area from skin to chest wall without enhancement. Conclusion: Change of tumor bed after IORT seems to persist for long time. Strong skin pull that influences the cosmetic outcome seems to relate with the continuous low T2 signal area from skin to chest wall."
"Keisch, M., et al.",2003,Initial clinical experience with the MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present the results of the initial clinical testing of the MammoSite balloon breast brachytherapy applicator in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Methods and Materials: Seventy patients were enrolled in a multicenter prospective trial testing the applicator for safety and performance. Fifty-four patients were implanted, and 43 patients were ultimately eligible for and received brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality after lumpectomy. Patients were staged T1N0M0 with negative pathologic margins and age >45 years. A dose of 34 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions over 5 days prescribed to 1 cm from the applicator surface using 192Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy. A minimum skin-to-balloon surface distance of 5 mm was required for treatment. Device performance, complications, and cosmesis were assessed. Results: Computed tomography imaging post-balloon inflation showed 8, 14, and 21 patients with 5-6 mm, 7-9 mm, and >10 mm of skin spacing, respectively. Two patients were explanted because of inadequate skin spacing and 7 because of suboptimal conformance of the surgical cavity to the applicator balloon. One patient was explanted because of positive nodal status and another because of age. The most common side effects related to device placement included mild erythema, drainage, pain, and echymosis. No severe side effects related to implantation, brachytherapy, or explantation occurred. Side effects related to radiation therapy were generally mild with erythema, pain, and dry desquamation being the most common. At 1 month, 88% of patients were evaluated as having good-to-excellent cosmetic results. Conclusions: The MammoSite balloon breast brachytherapy applicator performed well clinically. All eligible patients completed treatment. Side effects were mild to moderate and self-limiting. Skin-balloon surface distance and balloon-cavity conformance were the main factors limiting the initial use of the device.  Science Inc."
"Keller, B., et al.",2005,A permanent breast seed implant as partial breast radiation therapy for early-stage patients: A comparison of palladium-103 and iodine-125 isotopes based on radiation safety considerations.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: A permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) technique has been developed as a new form of partial adjuvant radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. This study compares iodine-125 (125I) and palladium-103 (103Pd) isotopes by examining the exposure and effective dose (ED) to a patient's partner. Methods and Materials: A low-energy survey meter was used to measure exposure rates as a function of bolus thickness placed over 103Pd or 125I seeds. A general mathematical expression for the initial exposure rate at 1 m (ẋo,1m) from the skin surface as a function of the implant size, R, and the distance between the skin surface and the implant, d, was derived. Also, a second general equation is proposed to calculate the ED to the patient's partner. Results: The initial exposure rate at 1 meter and the ED are calculated as follows: ẋo,1m = 3α/2R3·β3 [e-β(2R+d)(βR + 1) + e-β·d(βR - 1)], and ED = aRb·[e-c(2R+d)·(cR + 1) + e-cd·(cR - 1)]. For 125I, the parameters are: α = 0.154409, β = 0.388460, a = 197, b = -0.95, and c = 0.38846. For 103Pd, they are: α = 0.06877, β = 0.421098, a = 18.6, b = -0.78, and c = 0.421098. For implant diameters varying from 2 to 6 cm and skin-to-implant distances varying from 0.7 to 4 cm, the ED is consistently below 2.6 mSv using the 103Pd isotope, but more than 5 mSv in many instances and possibly up to 20 mSv using 125I. Conclusions: PBSI using 103Pd seeds appears safe because the patient's partner ED is consistently below 5 mSv. The125I isotope is not recommended for PBSI.  Inc."
"Keller, B. M.",2011,Guidelines for permanent breast seed implant dosimetry.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A permanent breast seed implant, using stranded Pd-103 radioactive seeds and ultrasound image guidance, is a novel method of accelerated partial breast irradiation for select women with early stage breast cancer. This work presents pre and post implant dosimetric data, relates this data to clinical findings, and sets recommendations for those interested in starting a program. Materials/Methods: The dosimetric data on 98 patients, accrued through one of three clinical trials, are reported. Patients were accrued into either a phase I/II trial (67 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, May 2004 - March 2007), a multicentre registry trial assessing adverse events (28 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, April 2009 -), or a multicentre phase II trial for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (3 patients, May 2010 -). Pre-implant planning consisted of a CT scan to delineate the CTV (visible fibrosis) and PTV (visible fibrosis plus a 1.5 cm margin modified in the direction of the chest wall and skin). Treatment planning and dose volume histograms (DVH's) were done using Variseed software. Post implant dosimetry was done immediately after the implant and at 2 months post implant for the first 67 patients and then just at the 2 month time point for all remaining patients. Maximum skin dose, defined as the average dose over the hottest 1x1 cm2 surface area, was correlated to grade of skin toxicity. Results: The mean pre-implant dosimetric PTV coverage for the 98 patients were: 98.7% ± 1.2% (range: 94.5% - 100%) for V90 (the volume that receives 90% of the prescription dose), 97.2% ± 2.1% (range: 90.3% - 99.9%) for V100, 68.5% ± 14.2% (range: 32.7% - 91.5%) for V150, and 27.6% ± 8.5% (range: 15.1% - 62.3%) for V200. For the first 67 patients treated, the mean post implant V100 was 85.6% immediately after implant and 88.4% at 2 months and the mean V200 was 36.2% immediately after implant and 48.3% at 2 months. The change in the mean post implant V100 and mean V200 over the 2 month time period was statistically significant with P<0.005 in both cases. Skin toxicity at the 2 month time point was associated with maximum skin dose (p = 0.014). Conclusions: The recommendation is to aim for pre-implant PTV coverage of about 100% for V90, between 95% - 100% for V100 and between 20% - 30% for V200 since these numbers are associated with no ipsilateral local recurrences to date and good patient tolerance. The post implant PTV coverage increases over time probably due to a combination of target volume shrinkage, seeds coming together and edema changes. The maximum skin dose, defined as the average dose over the hottest 1x1 cm2 surface area, should be limited to less than 90% of the prescription dose to avoid delayed skin toxicity."

M., et al.",2008,A Radiation Badge Survey for Family Members Living With Patients Treated With a 103Pd Permanent Breast Seed Implant.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Sixty-seven patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated in a Phase I/II clinical trial using a 103Pd permanent breast seed implant as adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. We report the dose received by family members living with these patients and compare measured doses with theoretical worst-case scenario estimates. Methods and Materials: Exposure-rate measurements were taken at 1 m from the patient by using a calibrated low-energy survey meter. Landauer (Landauer Inc., Glenwood, IL) Luxel badges, with sensitivity of 0.01 mSv, were given to family members to wear after the implantation. Badge readings for 33 spouses and 28 other family members were used to estimate effective doses, and these were compared with theory. Results: Average preimplantation planning target volume from computed tomography was 50.3 ml (range, 18.0-96.7 ml), and average preimplantation distance between the skin and the most anterior planning target volume margin was 0.57 cm. The average maximum exposure rate was measured to be 2.4 ± 1.1 mR/h, and average measured dose to a spouse was 0.99 ± 1.0 mSv. The calculated exposure rates and spousal doses using preimplantation computed tomography scan data overestimated those measured. Average measured family member dose (excluding spouses) was 0.20 ± 0.58 mSv. Conclusions: Based on measured and calculated spousal doses, a permanent breast seed implant using 103Pd is safe for the public. However, it is recommended that extra precautions in the way of a breast patch be used when patients with an implant will be in the vicinity of toddlers or pregnant women.  Inc.

"Keller, B. M., et al.",2012,Permanent breast seed implant dosimetry quality assurance.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: A permanent breast seed implant is a novel method of accelerated partial breast irradiation for women with early-stage breast cancer. This article presents pre- and post-implant dosimetric data, relates these data to clinical outcomes, and makes recommendations for those interested in starting a program. Methods and Materials: A total of 95 consecutive patients were accrued into one of three clinical trials after breast-conserving surgery: a Phase I/II trial (67 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma); a Phase II registry trial (25 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma); or a multi-center Phase II trial for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (3 patients). Contouring of the planning target volume (PTV) was done on a Pinnacle workstation and dosimetry calculations, including dose-volume histograms, were done using a Variseed planning computer. Results: The mean pre-implant PTV coverage for the V90, V100, V150, and V200 were as follows: 98.8% ± 1.2% (range, 94.5-100%); 97.3% ± 2.1% (range, 90.3-99.9%), 68.8% ± 14.3% (range, 32.7-91.5%); and 27.8% ± 8.6% (range, 15.1-62.3%). The effect of seed motion was characterized by post-implant dosimetry performed immediately after the implantation (same day) and at 2 months after the implantation. The mean V100 changed from 85.6% to 88.4% (p = 0.004) and the mean V200 changed from 36.2% to 48.3% (p < 0.001). Skin toxicity was associated with maximum skin dose (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Preplanning dosimetry should aim for a V90 of approximately 100%, a V100 between 95% and 100%, and a V 200 between 20% and 30%, as these numbers are associated with no local recurrences to date and good patient tolerance. In general, the target volume coverage improved over the duration of the seed therapy. The maximum skin dose, defined as the average dose over the hottest 1 × 1-cm2 surface area, should be limited to 90% of the prescription dose to minimize delayed skin toxicity.  Inc.

"Keller, L. M., et al.",2011,Whole breast intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer: The fox chase cancer center experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To report the 5 year outcomes of the Fox Chase Cancer Center experience using whole breast intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Women with early stage breast cancer (stage 0, I, II) were treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation from 2003 - 2010. Their characteristics and follow-up data were prospectively collected in an IRB-approved database. Whole breast radiation was delivered via an IMRT technique utilizing a combination of open and segmented tangential fields, inverse dose planning, and step and shoot beam delivery. The median whole breast radiation dose was 46 Gy (range: 34-60 Gy) with a median boost dose of 14 Gy. Factors analyzed for their impact on local recurrence were age, pathologic T stage, histology, age, menopause status, margins, nodal status, use of a boost, and systemic therapy. Cosmesis was taken from the last reported follow up visit and preference was given to the patient-reported cosmesis when available. Results: Nine hundred fifty-five women with early stage invasive or noninvasive breast cancer were prospectively followed with a median follow-up of 27 months (range: 1-91 months). There were 11 ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR) and 1 locoregional (IBTR + nodal) recurrence. The 5 year actuarial IBTR and locoregional recurrence rate was 2.3% and 2.7%, respectively. Patients with in-situ disease (p = 0.02) and those who did not receive a boost (p = 0.03) were more likely to have a recurrence on univariate analysis; these factors did not remain significant on multivariate analysis. At last follow-up for patients with known cosmesis (N = 610), 63.7% of patient reported ''excellent'' cosmesis, 34.5% reported ''good'' cosmesis, and 1.64% reported ''fair/poor'' cosmesis. These results did not vary by cup size (A/B vs C vs D/E) or with the addition of systemic therapy. Those who received electron boosts of . 16Gy were more likely to report a poor cosmetic outcome vs those who received lower boost doses (p = 0.056). Conclusions: This is the largest prospective experience of IMRT for breast cancer reported to date. Breast IMRT is associated with low rates of local recurrence at 5 years. The very high rates of good or excellent patient-reported cosmetic outcomes did not vary by breast size or use of systemic therapy."
"Keshtgar, M. R., et al.",2011,"Cosmetic outcome one, Two, Three, and four years after intra-operative radiotherapy compared with external beam radiotherapy for treatment of early breast cancer: An objective assessment of patients from a randomized controlled trial.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The randomized controlled TARGIT Trial was designed to determine non-inferiority between the novel technique of TARGIT [intra-operative radiotherapy with Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss, Germany)] and conventional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in women with early breast cancer. The main outcome objective is risk of local relapse within the treated breast.We report here data from a sub-protocol assessing cosmesis in 114 women over 50 years participating in the TARGIT Trial from one centre (Perth, Australia). Materials/Methods: Frontal digital photographs from were assessed, blind to treatment, using specialist software (BCCT.core 2.0, INESC Porto, Portugal) which produces a composite score based on symmetry, color and scar. Statistical analysis was by generalized estimating equations (GEE) on all of the data, and logistic regression analysis at year 1. Results: One hundred fourteen patients have been assessed, median age at randomization 62 years (IQR 56 to 68). Photographs were taken at baseline (before surgery) and one, two, three and four years after initial breast conserving surgery; none had subsequent breast surgery. The scores were dichotomized into Excellent and Good (EG), and Fair and Poor (FP). There was a nonsignificant 45% increase in the odds of having an outcome of EG for patients in the TARGIT group relative to the EBRT group (OR = 1.45, 95%CI 0.78 - 2.69, p = 0.245) after adjusting for tumor size. The results were similar when adjusted for tumor grade and age of the patient. For year 1 only there was a statistically significant 2.35 fold increase in the odds of having an outcome of EG for patients in the TARGIT group relative to the EBRT group (OR = 2.35, 95%CI 1.02 - 5.45,p=0.047) after adjusting for age of the patient, tumor size and grade. Conclusions: These results confirm a significantly better cosmetic outcome with TARGIT compared to EBRT in the first year after surgery."
"Keshtgar, M. R. S., et al.",2011,Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer in patients in whom external beam radiation is not possible.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) following wide local excision of the primary tumor is the standard treatment in early breast cancer. In some circumstances this procedure is not possible or is contraindicated or difficult. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) when EBRT is not feasible. Methods and Materials: We report our experience with TARGIT in three centers (Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom) between 1999 and 2008. Patients at these centers received a single radiation dose of 20 Gy to the breast tissue in contact with the applicator (or 6 Gy at 1-cm distance), as they could not be given EBRT and were keen to avoid mastectomy. Results: Eighty patients were treated with TARGIT. Reasons for using TARGIT were 21 patients had previously received EBRT, and 31 patients had clinical reasons such as systemic lupus erythematosus, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, morbid obesity, and cardiovascular or severe respiratory disease. Three of these patients received percutaneous radiotherapy without surgery; 28 patients were included for compelling personal reasons, usually on compassionate grounds. After a median follow-up of 38 months, only two local recurrences were observed, an annual local recurrence rate of 0.75% (95% confidence interval, 0.09%-2.70%). Conclusions: While we await the results of the randomized trial (over 2,000 patients have already been recruited), TARGIT is an acceptable option but only in highly selected cases that cannot be recruited in the trial and in whom EBRT is not feasible/possible.

"Kestin, L. L., et al.",2000,Improving the dosimetric coverage of interstitial high-dose-rate breast implants.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective: We performed a retrospective computed tomography (CT)-based three-dimensional (3D) dose-volume analysis of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial breast implants to evaluate the adequacy of lumpectomy cavity coverage, and then designed a simple, reproducible algorithm for dwell-time adjustment to correct for underdosage of the lumpectomy cavity.Methods and Materials: Since March 1993, brachytherapy has been used as the sole radiation modality after lumpectomy in selected protocol patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. In this protocol, all patients received 32 Gy in 8 fractions of 4 Gy over 4 days. Eleven patients treated with HDR brachytherapy who underwent CT scanning after implant placement were included in this analysis. For each patient, the postimplant CT dataset was transferred to a 3D treatment planning system, and the relevant tissue volumes were outlined on each axial slice. The implant dataset, including the dwell positions and dwell times, were imported into the 3D planning system and then registered to the visible implant template in the CT dataset. The calculated dose distribution was analyzed with respect to defined volumes via dose-volume histograms. Due to the variability of lumpectomy cavity coverage discovered in this 3D quality assurance analysis, dwell times at selected positions were adjusted in an attempt to improve dosimetric coverage of the lumpectomy cavity. Using implant data from 5 cases, a dwell-time adjustment algorithm was designed and was then tested on 11 cases. In this algorithm, a point P was identified using axial CT images, which was representative of the underdosed region within the cavity. The distance (d) from point P to the nearest dwell position was measured. A number of dwell positions (N) nearest to point P were selected for dwell time adjustment. The algorithm was tested by increasing the dwell times of a variable number of positions (N = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 20) by a weighting factor (α), where α = f(d) and α > 1, and subsequently performing 3D dose-volume analysis to evaluate the improvement in lumpectomy cavity coverage.Results: Before adjustment in the 11 implants, the median proportion of the lumpectomy cavity and target volume that received at least the prescription dose was 85% and 68%, respectively. After dwell-time adjustment, lumpectomy cavity coverage was significantly improved in all 11 cases. The median distance from point P to the nearest dwell position (d) was 1.4 cm (range 0.9-1.9). The median volume of the lumpectomy cavity receiving 32 Gy increased from 85.3% in the actual implant to 97.0% (range 74-100%) by increasing the dwell time of a single dwell position by a median factor (α) of 12.2 according to the above algorithm. With N = 3, the median proportion of the cavity volume receiving 32 Gy was improved to 97.5% (range 77-100%), with a median α of 5.7. Further improvement in lumpectomy cavity coverage was relatively small by increasing additional dwell times. In addition, with N = 20, the median absolute volume of breast tissue receiving 150% of the prescription dose was 70.3 cm3 compared to 26.3 cm3 in the actual implant; whereas with N = 1 or N = 3, this median volume was only 35.9 and 42.0 cm3, respectively.Conclusion: Lumpectomy cavity coverage sometimes appears suboptimal with interstitial HDR breast brachytherapy using our current technique. A simple dwell-time increase at only 1-3 dwell positions can compensate for some underdosage without creating significant regions of overdosage. Using simple methodology, a single reference point representing the underdosed region can be utilized for initial selection of the dwell positions to be increased.

"Kestin, L. L., et al.",2000,Intensity modulation to improve dose uniformity with tangential breast radiotherapy: Initial clinical experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present a new technique to improve dose uniformity and potentially reduce acute toxicity with tangential whole-breast radiotherapy (RT) using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The technique of multiple static multileaf collimator (sMLC) segments was used to facilitate IMRT.Methods and Materials: Ten patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent treatment planning for whole-breast RT using a new method of IMRT. The three-dimensional (3D) dose distribution was first calculated for equally weighted, open tangential fields (i.e., no blocks, no wedges). Dose calculation was corrected for density effects with the pencil-beam superposition algorithm. Separate MLC segments were constructed to conform to the beam's-eye-view projections of the 3D isodose surfaces in 5% increments, ranging from the 120% to 100% isodose surface. Medial and lateral MLC segments that conformed to the lung tissue in the fields were added to reduce transmission. Using the beam-weight optimization utility of the 3D treatment planning system, the sMLC segment weights were then determined to deliver the most uniform dose to 100 reference points that were uniformly distributed throughout the breast. The accuracy of the dose calculation and resultant IMRT delivery was verified with film dosimetry performed on an anthropomorphic phantom. For each patient, the dosimetric uniformity within the breast tissue was evaluated for IMRT and two other treatment techniques. The first technique modeled conventional practice where wedges were derived manually without consideration of inhomogeneity effects (or density correction). A recalculation was performed with density correction to represent the actual dose delivered. In the second technique, the wedges were optimized using the same beam-weight optimization utility as the IMRT plan and included density correction. All dose calculations were based on the pencil-beam superposition algorithm.Results: For the sMLC technique, treatment planning required approximately 60 min. Treatment delivery (including patient setup) required approximately 8-10 min. Film dosimetry measurements performed on an anthropomorphic phantom generally agreed with calculations to within ± 3%. Compared to the wedge techniques, IMRT with sMLC segments resulted in smaller 'hot spots' and a lower maximum dose, while maintaining similar coverage of the treatment volume. A median of only 0.1% of the treatment volume received ≥ 110% of the prescribed dose when using IMRT versus 10% with standard wedges. A total of 6-8 segments were required with the majority of the dose delivered via the open segments. The addition of the lung-block segments to IMRT was of significant benefit for patients with a greater proportion of lung parenchyma within the irradiated volume. Since August 1999, 32 patients have been treated in the clinic with the IMRT technique. No patient experienced RTOG grade III or greater acute skin toxicity.Conclusion: The use of intensity modulation with an sMLC technique for tangential breast RT is an efficient and effective method for achieving uniform dose throughout the breast. It is dosimetrically superior to the treatment techniques that employ only wedges. Preliminary findings reveal minimal or no acute skin reactions for patients with various breast sizes.

"Key, S., et al.",2017,Cosmetic outcome and late breast toxicity after intraoperative radiation therapy as a single modality or as a boost using the intrabeam® device: A prospective study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We aim to report our results in terms of late toxicities and cosmetic outcomes after intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using kV X-rays in women treated for early breast cancer at our institution. Purpose/Objective(s): Patients were eligible if they met the following criteria: age ≥50, non-metastatic grade 1-2, Erb2 negative hormone receptor positive unicentric-unifocal and ≤ 3 cm non-lobular early breast carcinoma. Patients were treated with IORT using the kV X-rays Intrabeam® device following lumpectomy and sentinel node biospy. IORT was completed by whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) at the dose of 46 in 23 fractions to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions (depending on breast size) in case of adverse pathologic criteria on the final specimen examination. Breast toxicity was graded using the LENT SOMA scale every 6 months and cosmetic outcomes were evaluated at 36 months by patient self-evaluation and by 2 radiation oncologists on a 1-10 scale. Results: Between April 2011 and November 2014, 71 patients were included. Forty-one women received IORT only and 30 patients received IORT followed by WBRT. After a median follow up of 38.9 months, no locoregional or distant recurrence occurred. After IORT only, 2.4% of grade ≥2 breast fibrosis, 41.5% of grade 1 breast retraction, and 7.3% of grade 1 breast edema was observed. No patient developed another grade ≥2 toxicity. In the IORT +WBRT group, grade ≥2 fibrosis, grade ≥2 breast retraction, and grade 1 breast edema were 43.3%, 23.3% and 16.7%, respectively. There was a significant difference in terms of skin grade ≥2 toxicity between IORT only and IORT +WBRT (2.4% versus 46.6%) (p=0,0001). Objective cosmetic outcomes were very good and significantly better in the IORT only group compared to the IORT+ WBRT group (8.87 vs 6.96) (p<0.001). Conclusion: IORT using the Intrabeam® is well tolerated with very little late skin and breast toxicity and very good cosmetic outcome. However, a high rate of grade ≥2 late skin toxicity was observed when IORT had to be completed by WBRT."
"Khan, A. J., et al.",2010,Tamoxifen confers a limited benefit in older women with early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Older age ( > 65 years) has been associated with relatively indolent breast cancer in women with respect to local relapse-free (LRFS), distant metastasis-free (DMFS), and cause-specific survival (CSS). Adjuvant tamoxifen has been recommended for all women with ER-positive breast carcinoma irrespective of age. It is unclear whether conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS + RT) is as effective as CS+RT plus tamoxifen in older women ( > 65 years) with small, node negative breast cancer. Materials/Methods: We reviewed a single-institution database of 2,478 patients and selected 224 patients who were > 65 years of age and who had pathologic T1N0M0 breast cancer treated with CS+RT between 1979 and 2003. The median follow-up time was 62.6 months. One hundred two patients (45.5%) received tamoxifen and were placed in the TAM cohort and 122 patients (54.5%) did not receive tamoxifen (no-TAM). The association between TAM group, pathologic markers, co-variables, treatment regimen employed, and outcomes were assessed in a chi-square model. The primary end points of LRFS, DMFS, CSS, and overall survival (OS) over 10 years were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: The TAM cohort was not significantly associated with method of detection, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, race, family history, use of adjuvant chemotherapy, or margin status (all p . 0.05) In addition, the TAM cohort did not experience a reduction in contralateral breast cancers when compared to the no-TAM cohort (p = 0.51). There were a total of 4 local relapses and 15 distant metastases in the study. The 10-year LRFS was 98% in the TAM and no-TAM cohorts (p = 0.58), while the 10-year DMFS was 83% in theTAMgroup and 89% in the no-TAM group (p = 0.91). The 10-year CSS and OS was also statistically similar between the two cohorts. In univariate analysis, the use of tamoxifen was not associated with improved LRFS, DMFS, or OS (p . 0.05). Conclusions: In this large retrospective cohort of T1N0 breast cancer patients over the age of 65 treated with CS+RT, those that did not receive adjuvant tamoxifen did not appear to have worse outcomes. Specifically, use of TAM in this cohort of elderly women did not appear to confer any systemic benefit, including contralateral breast cancer rates, systemic failure rates and survival rates. If the only benefit of TAM in this group of patients is local control, patients may be able to receive RT and safely omit 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy. Only a randomized trial of CS+RT with or without hormones in women over 65 can definitively answer this question."
"Khan, A. J., et al.",2012,"Local control, toxicity, and cosmesis in women >70 years enrolled in the American Society of Breast Surgeons accelerated partial breast irradiation registry trial.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The American Society of Breast Surgeons enrolled women in a registry trial to prospectively study patients treated with the MammoSite Radiation Therapy System breast brachytherapy device. The present report examined the outcomes in women aged >70 years enrolled in the trial. Methods and Materials: A total of 1,449 primary early stage breast cancers were treated in 1,440 women. Of these, 537 occurred in women >70 years old. Fisher's exact test was performed to correlate age (≤70 vs. >70 years) with toxicity and with cosmesis. The association of age with local recurrence (LR) failure times was investigated by fitting a parametric model. Results: Older women were less likely to develop telangiectasias than younger women (7.9% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.0083). The incidence of other toxicities was similar. Cosmesis was good or excellent in 92% of the women >70 years old. No significant difference was found in LR as a function of age. The 5-year actuarial LR rate with invasive disease for the older vs. younger population was 2.79% and 2.92%, respectively (p = 0.5780). In women >70 years with hormone-sensitive tumors ≤2 cm who received hormonal therapy (n = 195), the 5-year actuarial rate of LR, overall survival, disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival was 2.06%, 89.3%, 87%, and 97.5%, respectively. These outcomes were similar in women who did not receive hormonal therapy. Women with small, estrogen receptor-negative disease had worse LR, overall survival, and disease-free survival compared with receptor-positive patients. Conclusions: Accelerated partial breast irradiation with the MammoSite radiation therapy system resulted in low toxicity and produced similar cosmesis and local control at 5 years in women >70 years compared with younger women. This treatment should be considered as an alternative to omitting adjuvant radiotherapy for older women with small-volume, early-stage breast cancer.  Inc."
"Khwaja, S. S., et al.",2013,Long-term cosmesis and toxicity profile following accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI): Final analysis of the american society of breast surgeons breast brachytherapy registry trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recent retrospective, claims-based analyses have suggested a potential increased rate of toxicities associated with brachytherapy based APBI. In light of the limitations of such studies, the purpose of this analysis was to examine cosmesis and toxicity profiles as part of the final analysis of the American Society of Breast Surgeons breast brachytherapy registry trial. Materials/Methods: One thousand four hundred forty-nine cases of early stage breast cancer underwent breast conserving therapy. The single lumen device was used to deliver adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) (34 Gy in 3.4 Gy fractions). Investigators were asked to evaluate cosmesis at each follow-up visit using the Harvard criteria and also asked to report the presence or absence of any seromas and fat necrosis at any time points after treatment. Follow-up for the final analysis was complete through December 2012. For the entire cohort, the median follow-up was 63.1 months with 974 patients (67.2%), 789 patients (54.5%), and 650 patients (44.9%) having follow-up greater than four, five, and six years, respectively. This represents the final analysis; as per protocol, the study was designed to follow patients for 7 years. Results: The rate of excellent/good cosmesis was 90.6% at 84 months with similar findings noted for the first 400 patients enrolled. The rate of a complication (symptomatic seroma, infection, fat necrosis, and telangiectasias) at one year/any time point was 24.2%/38.5% while the rate of non-infectious complications at one year/any time point was 14.8%/28.9%. The incidence rate of any seroma, symptomatic seroma, and seroma requiring drainage are 28.9%, 13.4%, and 12.2% at any time point and 3.1%, 0.6%, and 0.5% beyond 24 months. The rate of infection at any time was 9.6%; the rate was 11.8% for open cavity and 7.8% for closed cavity with a 0.1% incidence beyond 24 months. The incidence of telangiectasias was 2.6% within the first 12 months, 2.3% at 12-18 months, 3.2% at 18-24 months, and 6.8% beyond 24 months. Conclusions: The final toxicity analysis from the American Society of Breast Surgeons Registry confirms the previously noted excellent cosmesis and toxicity and fails to confirm limited, retrospective analyses that had suggested higher rates of toxicity for APBI. The incidence of toxicities beyond 24 months from treatment remains low with respect to telangiectasias, fat necrosis, and seromas."
"Kiess, A. P., et al.",2010,Adjuvant trastuzumab reduces locoregional recurrence in women who undergo breast conservation therapy for node-negative HER2-positive breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer have a higher risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR), even in the setting of lymph node-negative disease that is treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT). Whether adjuvant trastuzumab reduces the risk of LRR in these women is unknown, as these patients were often excluded or underrepresented in earlier randomized studies. In this retrospective, single institution study, we evaluated LRR in women with≤5 cm, node-negative, HER2+ breast cancer who underwent BCT with or without adjuvant trastuzumab. Materials/Methods: Through our institutional database, 197 women were identified with≤5 cm, node-negative, HER2+ (IHC 3+ or FISH ≥2) breast cancer diagnosed between 1/01/02 and 12/31/08 and treated with BCT including whole breast radiation. Two cohorts were compared: 70 trastuzumab-untreated women diagnosed between 1/01/02 and 5/21/04 and 103 trastuzumab/chemotherapy- treated women diagnosed between 5/16/05 and 12/31/08. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate locoregional recurrence- free survival (invasive and noninvasive). Results: The two cohorts were similar in age at diagnosis, tumor size, histology, hormone receptor status, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy. The median tumor size was 1.5 (0.2-4.0) cm in the “no-trastuzumab” and 1.5 (0.3-4.5) cm in the “trastuzumab” cohorts. Chemotherapy was administered in 73% of the “no-trastuzumab” and 100% of the “trastuzumab” cohorts. In both groups, 99% of patients completed external beam radiotherapy to the breast with a median dose of 6000 (4240-7500) c Gy. The median follow-up for women without recurrence was 74mo (23-95mo) for the “no-trastuzumab” and 32 months (5-56 months) for the “trastuzumab” cohorts. The 3-year locoregional recurrence-free survival was 92% (95% CI, 86-98%) for the “no-trastuzumab” and 98% (95% CI, 94-100%) for the “trastuzumab” cohorts. In the “no-trastuzumab” cohort, LRR occurred in 7 patients (10%) at a median time of 14 (7-36) months. In the “trastuzumab” cohort, LRR occurred in 1 patient (1%) at 35 months. Conclusions: The recently reported high locoregional failure rates in early HER2-positive breast cancer can be reduced to a low level with adjuvant trastuzumab. We observed 10% LRR within 3 years without trastuzumab and 1% with trastuzumab in women with node-negative disease who underwent BCT."

Y., et al.",2013,"Phase 2 trial of accelerated, hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation of 39 Gy in 13 fractions followed by a tumor bed boost sequentially delivering 9 Gy in 3 fractions in early-stage breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To report a phase 2 trial of accelerated, hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (AH-WBI) delivered as a daily dose of 3 Gy to the whole breast followed by a tumor bed boost. Methods and Materials Two hundred seventy-six patients diagnosed with breast cancer (pT1-2 and pN0-1a) who had undergone breast-conserving surgery in which the operative margins were negative were treated with AH-WBI delivered as 39 Gy in 13 fractions of 3 Gy to the whole breast once daily over 5 consecutive working days, and 9 Gy in 3 sequential fractions of 3 Gy to a lumpectomy cavity, all within 3.2 weeks. Results After a median follow-up period of 57 months (range: 27-75 months), the rate of 5-year locoregional recurrence was 1.4% (n=4), whereas that of disease-free survival was 97.4%. No grade 3 skin toxicity was reported during the follow-up period. Qualitative physician cosmetic assessments of good or excellent were noted in 82% of the patients at 2 months after the completion of AH-WBI. The global cosmetic outcome did not worsen over time, and a good or excellent cosmetic outcome was reported in 82% of the patients at 3 years. The mean pretreatment percentage breast retraction assessment was 12.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.14-12.86). The mean value of percentage breast retraction assessment increased to 13.99 (95% CI: 12.17-15.96) after 1 year and decreased to 13.54 (95% CI: 11.84-15.46) after 3 years but was not significant (P>.05). Conclusions AH-WBI consisting of 39 Gy in 13 fractions followed by a tumor bed boost sequentially delivering 9 Gy in 3 fractions can be delivered with excellent disease control and tolerable skin toxicity in patients with early-stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery.

"Kim, M. J., et al.",2019,"Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation with Carbon-ion, Proton, CyberKnife and Conventional VMAT.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To quantitatively analyze the dosimetric effect of stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation (S-APBI) on early-stage breast cancer, we compare 4 different kinds of radiation treatment planning using MultiPlan for CyberKnife M6 (CK), RayStation for intensity modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT), intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), and conventional volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Materials/Methods: For ten breast cancer patients referred for early-stage T1N0M0 as APBI treatment, planning for CK, IMCT, IMPT and VMAT was generated. All plan was generated based on the same CTV, 10 mm margin based on tumor cavity, with different margins for PTV to secure the reliability of treatment. As a stereotactic radiation surgery with CyberKnife fiducial tracking system, 1 mm margin for PTV was applied into CK. 2 mm for IMCT, IMPT, and 3 mm for VMAT was the margins for PTV. IMCT, IMPT plan, consisting of three (non-)coplanar beam arrangement was applied and especially for IMCT plan, robust optimization for PTV (2 mm iso-tropical margin for patient setup uncertainty and 3.5% for range uncertainty) was utilized. VMAT with two arc beam arrangement was generated. 30 Gy in 5 fractions was applied for CK, VMAT whereas 30 gray equivalents (GyE; physical dose in Gy × RBE) in 5 fractions was applied for IMCT. CTV coverage and the organs at risk as well as conformity and homogeneity indexes for PTV was calculated from dose volume histograms. Results: All treatment plan had fulfilled the prescription (D95% for CTV ≥ 99%). In planning comparison among the 4 different modalities, IMCT achieved better homogeneity compared to IMPT, CK, and VMAT and achieved better conformity compared to IMPT. Generally, planning results from particle therapy has showed better OARs spare effect, especially for heart, contralateral breast and lung. Dosimetric characteristics of proton, sharp dose fall-off, compared to carbon-ion, IMPT showed better sparing effect for contralateral breast. Also, the highest cardiac dose (D3%) calculated for CK, 395 cGy, which was more than 2 times greater than that calculated by IMCT. In terms of cardiac dose, special attention for CK plan was required because the direction of some node pointed to the heart and these condition could cause the high delivered dose to heart. [Figure presented] Conclusion: Dosimetric effect of CK, IMCT, IMPT, and VMAT for APBI was quantitatively demonstrated. Results from particle therapy has showed better OARs spare, especially for heart, also better homogeneity compared to photon-based treatment."
"Kim, S. W., et al.",2017,Risk factors for regional recurrence in node-negative breast cancer: Implications of regional nodal irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Two recent prospective randomized controlled trials that demonstrated survival benefit of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in early-stage breast cancer included some patients with negative lymph nodes. We examined regional recurrence (RR) as the first failure in node-negative breast cancer and its risk factors. Purpose/Objective(s): We reviewed 975 breast cancer patients with pathologically negative lymph nodes who received either breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiotherapy (n = 770), or total mastectomy with or without chest wall irradiation (n = 205) between 2004 and 2012. All patients received sentinel lymph node biopsy or limited axillary lymph node dissection. Adjuvant systemic treatments were administered to 920 patients (94.4%). The whole breast or chest wall was irradiated with a total dose of 45 Gy. An additional boost of 4-24 Gy was delivered to the primary excision site or mastectomy scar by an electron beam. The cumulative incidence rate of RR was calculated using Gray's test with competing risks consisting of local recurrence, distant metastasis, contralateral breast tumor, and death from causes other than breast cancer. Results: During the median follow-up period of 88 months, 24 patients experienced RR as the first failure. Of these, distant metastasis occurred simultaneously in 11 patients and metachronously in 7 patients. The median overall survival period of patients after RR diagnosis was 35 months. The 5-year cumulative incidence rate of RR was 2.5% in all patients, including 1.4% at the axillary area, 0.3% at the internal mammary area, and 1.1% at the supraclavicular area. Positive lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (p <0.001), histologic grade 3 (p = 0.008), intrinsic subtypes (p = 0.022), and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (p = 0.034) were significantly associated with increased risk of RR. After multivariate competing risk regression model, positive LVSI (relative risk, 7.05; p <0.001), and histologic grade 3 (relative risk, 3.21; p = 0.003) remained independent risk factors for RR. Patients with two risk factors had significantly increased risk of RR with 5-year cumulative incidence rate of 12.6% compared with those having single risk factor (2.5%) or those who did not have any risk factors (0.4%) (p <0.001). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 80.7% for patients with 2 risk factors, 91.1% for patients with single risk factor, and 94.9% for patients with no risk factors (p <0.001). Conclusion: RR was closely related to distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Patients with positive LVSI and histologic grade 3 had significantly increased risk of RR. RNI might reduce regional recurrence and improve survival in these patients."
"Kim, S. Y., et al.",2016,Dosimetric comparison of robotic IMRT and partial-ARC vmat in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s):We conducted a pilot plan study for APBI to set up an effective and new approach of IMRT using different modalities. This study compares dosimetric and treatment-relevant parameters between partial arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (P-VMAT) and robotic IMRT (R-IMRT/robotic radiosurgery with multileaf collimator). Materials/Methods: Eight patients were selected (LT nZ4, RT nZ4). Two different plans using VMAT and R-IMRT were created. Surgical clips were used as fiducials for R-IMRT with synchrony tracking. A total of 34 Gy in 10 fractions was prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV). Dosimetric parameters including conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and dose gradient range (DGRZReff50%-ReffRX, ReffRXZ((3-VRX)/4-P)1/3) were used for plan evaluation. PTV coverage and organs at risk (OAR) dose were also evaluated according to NSABP B39/RTOG-0413 guideline. For clinical application, monitor units (MUs), delivery time, and segments number were also compared. Results: Both plans satisfied the goal of the guideline. 95% of the PTV was to receive 100% of the prescription dose. P-VMAT significantly reduced heart volumes receiving 1.7 Gy versus R-IMRT (the mean V1.7Gy was 1.6% vs 0.1% and 29.1% vs 11.1% for RT and LT, P<0.01). No other significant difference was observed both in PTV coverage and OAR dose (Table 1). The mean CI and HI value of PTV were 1.05 0.05 and 1.09 0.03 in PVMAT plans and 1.04 0.03 and 1.12 0.02 in R-IMRT plans. The mean DGR was 1.22 0.17 cm and 1.49 0.3 cm for R-IMRT and P-VMAT plans. In addition, the mean MUs for P-VMAT (710.7 42.3) were less 56.5% than those for R-IMRT (1634.2 132.8). Delivery time takes about 14 times longer for R-IMRT (33 6.9 minutes) than P-VMAT (2.3 0.4 minutes) without considering patients' setup time. The mean segments number was 333.6 18.3 for P-VMAT and 130.6 37.7 for R-IMRT. Conclusion: Both modalities achieved clinically acceptable plans and similar outcomes. Considering the DGR values, R-IMRT rapidly decreases the high dose region in normal tissue adjacent to the target which means effective sparing of normal breast. Though we used the same PTV for both plans to compare dosimetric parameters, R-IMRTwith synchrony tracking is a very attractive system that can reduce the target margin in actual treatment. In spite of these advantages, R-IMRT requires more MUs and beam delivery time to deliver similar target prescription to the tumor than P-VMAT. PVMAT would be considered useful modality in terms of efficiency. (Table presented)."
"Kini, V. R., et al.",1999,"Mammographic, pathologic, and treatment-related factors associated with local recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving therapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: We retrospectively reviewed our institution's experience treating early-stage breast cancer patients with breast conserving therapy (BCT) to determine clinical, pathologic, mammographic, and treatment-related factors associated with outcome. Methods: Between January 1980 and December 1987, 400 cases of Stage I and II breast cancer were managed with BCT at William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan. All patients underwent at least an excisional biopsy. Radiation treatment consisted of delivering 45- 50 Gy to the whole breast, followed by a boost to the tumor bed to at least 60 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up in the 292 surviving patients is 118 months. Multiple clinical, pathologic, mammographic, and treatment- related factors were analyzed for an association with local recurrence and survival. Results: A total of 37 local recurrences developed in the treated breast, for a 5- and 10-year actuarial rate of 4% and 10%, respectively. On univariate analysis, patient age ≤ 35 years (25% vs. 7%, p = 0.004), and positive surgical margins (17% vs. 6%, p = 0.018) were associated with an increased risk of local recurrence at 10 years. On multivariate analysis, only age ≤ 35 years remained significant. A subset analysis of 214 patients with evaluable mammographic findings was performed. On univariate analysis, age ≤ 35 years (38% vs. 8%, p = 0.0029) and the presence of calcifications on preoperative mammography (22% vs. 6%, p = 0.0016) were associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. On multivariate analysis, both of these factors remained significant. The presence of calcifications on preoperative mammography did not affect the rates of overall survival, disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival. Conclusion: In patients with early- stage breast cancer treated with BCT, age ≤ 35 years and calcifications on preoperative mammography appear to be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence."
"Kobic, A., et al.",2017,Long-term outcomes of breast conservation therapy in unifocal versus multifocal early stage breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Studies have shown that patients with unifocal breast cancer (UBC) and those with multifocal breast cancer (MBC) had similar rates of local/regional recurrence (LRR) and survival following breast conserving therapy (BCT). However, long term outcomes are not well established. The purpose of this study is to assess long term LRR and survival rates after BCT for UBC and MBC. Purpose/Objective(s): With IRB approval, we identified all patients from 1994 to 2000 with stage I/II breast cancer who were treated with BCT and received both definitive surgical and radiation therapy. We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records to determine imaging, pathologic, and subsequent treatment related factors. Patients with the following were excluded: neoadjuvant therapy, multi-centric disease (>1 tumor in different quadrants of the breast), non-invasive second tumor, or bilateral disease. All tumors were excised with negative margins. No patient with MBC underwent breast MRI prior to BCT. The Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals was used to determine LRR and survival outcomes. Cox regression was performed to determine hazard ratios (HRs). Results: Median follow-up of the 581 patients was 18.3 years. Median age was 60 years (range, 26-89). UBC and MBC were found in 553 and 28 patients, respectively. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups: ductal histology 84.3% vs 78.6%, lobular histology 7.9% vs 7.1%, median tumor size 1.3cm vs 1.2cm, positive estrogen receptor 82.9% vs 82.5%, lymph node status N0 79.3% vs 78.0%, N1 17.2% vs 21.0%, N2 3.4% vs 0%. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 22.2%, and 45.1% received endocrine therapy. Median breast radiation dose was 5040 cGy. 78% of patients underwent a boost, median 1000cGy. Breast events were identified in 107 UBC and 10 MBC patients. Rates (95% CI) for unifocal and multifocal patients were respectively the following: (1) 15 yr freedom from ipsilateral LRR, 87.2% (83.5, 91.0) vs 94.4% (80.6, 100); p=0.68 (2) 15 yr freedom from contralateral breast event 88.2% (84.9, 91.5) vs 73.2 (53.0,94.9); p=0.01, Hazard Ratio: 2.6, (3) 15 yr overall survival, 46.3% (42%,51%) vs 38% (22.5%,46.6%); p =0.13 (4) 15 yr disease free survival, 46.33% (42.0%,51.1%) vs 38.0% (22.46%, 64.4%); p=0.13. Conclusion: With long term follow up, ipsilateral LRR, overall survival, and disease free survival did not differ between UBC and MBC patients treated with BCT. MBC was associated with higher rates of contralateral breast tumor events, possibly suggestive of differences in underlying risk. Further study of modern cohorts of patients with multi-focal disease treated with BCT is warranted."
"Kodaira, T., et al.",2001,Aichi Cancer Center 10-year experience with conservative breast treatment of early breast cancer: Retrospective analysis regarding failure patterns and factors influencing local control.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We analyzed the clinical results of conservative breast therapy in our institute to determine the risk factors influencing local and distant disease recurrence. Methods and Materials: From 1989 to 1997, 301 breasts of 295 women with early breast cancer were treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. There were 212 incidences of Stage I breast cancer, and 89 of Stage II. Patients were routinely treated with local resection, axillar dissection, and 46-50 Gy irradiation given in 23-25 fractions. Some also received a radiation boost to the tumor bed. Results: The 5-/8-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 93.2/91.5%, 86.0/80.6%, and 95.1/92.5%, respectively. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor volume, estrogen receptor status, and age < 40 years were significant prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Both age < 40 years and surgical method had a strong effect on local control by uni- and multivariate analysis. Surgical margin status was a significant prognostic factor for local control at the univariate level (p < 0.0001), though it had only borderline significance at the multivariate level (p = 0.08). No patient experienced severe morbidity due to radiotherapy. Conclusion: The results obtained are comparable to previously reported data. Although the follow-up period was too short to draw definite conclusions about long-term outcomes, the outcome from conservative breast treatment was acceptable. Copyright  Science Inc."
"Kolberg, H. C., et al.",2016,Targeted intraoperative radiation therapy tumor bed boost during breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC and HER2 positive breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Targeted intraoperative radiation therapy (TARGIT e IORT) as a tumor bed boost after breast conserving surgery is well established for women with early breast cancer. A previous study from our group shows a beneficial effect of TARGIT-IORT on overall survival but not disease free survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to an external boost. In this study we present an analysis of triple negative and HER2 positive tumors from this cohort. Materials/Methods: This non-randomized cohort study involved 70 consecutive patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by breast conserving therapy. We compared the outcomes of patients who received their tumor bed boost with TARGIT IORT using a 50kV X-ray source at the time of lumpectomy (20 Gy to surface of tumor bed in a single dose) after it was introduced versus patients treated in the previous 13 months with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) boost of 10 Gy in 5 fractions. All patients received whole breast external beam radiation therapy (25 fractions 50 Gy). All HER2 positive patients received trastuzumab concurrent with the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and were completed up to one year after surgery. 28 patients were triple negative (TARGIT: 16; EBRT: 12) and 42 patients were HER2 positive (TARGIT: 24; EBRT: 18). Disease free survival and overall survival were compared. Results: Median follow-up was 49 months. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival showed no significant difference in HER2 positive tumors: TARGIT 0 events 100%, EBRT 1 event 91.7%, log-rank P = 0.22. The same was seen for disease free survival: TARGIT 2 events 83.3%, EBRT 4 events 77.0%, log rank P = 0.38. The results for triple negative cases were similar. Overall survival: TARGIT 2 events 87.5%, EBRT 3 events 74.1%, log rank P = 0.488. Disease free survival: TARGIT 2 events 87.5%, EBRT 4 events 60%, log rank P = 0.22. Conclusion: Although trends were favorable for TARGIT-IORT, no significant differences could be shown and the significantly positive result for overall survival in the whole cohort of 116 patients could not be reproduced in this substudy on triple negative and HER2 positive tumors. The reason for this may be the small number of events, but it may also indicate that the results for the whole cohort were mainly driven by ER and/or PR positive and HER2 negative patients."
"Korah, M. P., et al.",2012,Implications of omitting radiation after breast conserving surgery in elderly women with low-risk invasive breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Following the publication of the CALGB 9343 and Fyles et al trials in 2004, opinions have varied regarding the benefit of radiation therapy (RT) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) in elderly women with early stage, ER+ breast cancer. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) failed to show a survival advantage despite lower rates of local relapse with RT after BCS in women that received tamoxifen, with a small number of breast cancer specific deaths observed. The specific aims of this analysis are to assess changes in patterns of care and to determine cancer specific (CSS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes with and without RT after BCS in a large population based cohort. Materials/Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for women ≥age 70 diagnosed with T1 or T2, N0 M0 ER+ breast cancer that underwent BCS from 2000-2008, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. The cohort was stratified by type of treatment into two groups: BCS or BCS + RT. Clinical covariates were compared between the groups using the Chi-square test. Cox multivariable regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of CSS and OS. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results: The study cohort is comprised of 27,559 women. One third of the women were ≥80 years. Most tumors were ≥2 cm (85%), grade 1 or 2 (81%), and PR+ (81%). Seventy percent of patients received RT after BCS; the proportion of patients receiving RT was 72% from 2000-2004 and 66% from 2005-2008. Patients were statistically more likely to undergo RT if they met one of the following criteria: age <80 years, diagnosis from 2000-2004, or if re-excision of the biopsy site was required for residual disease. A total of 4,573 deaths were recorded among which 790 were attributed to breast cancer. CSS at 5/8 years was 95%/91% (BCS) versus 97%/95% (BCS + RT), p < 0.001. OS at 5/8 years was 69%/49% (BCS) versus 87%/73% (BCS + RT), p < 0.001. Radiation use was associated with improved CSS (HR: 0.61) and OS (HR: 0.51), p < 0.001. Age ≥80 years and grade 3 tumors were associated with worse CSS and OS, p < 0.001. Conclusions: In this analysis of >25,000 elderly women with small, ER+, N0 breast cancers, RT delivery after BCS appeared to be associated with a reduction in the risk of death. An evolution in the patterns of care was noted after 2004 with a 6% drop in RT utilization. The perceptible shift in practice paradigm dovetailed the publication of the aforementioned RCTs. The SEER database did not provide information pertaining to comorbidities, surgical margin status, and use of endocrine therapy which may have contributed to selection bias. The large number of patients and breast cancer specific events in this analysis highlight survival differences between the BCS and BCS + RT groups, which may not have been detected in earlier studies."
"Kowalchik, K. V., et al.",2011,Preoperative breast MRI influences patient selection for partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The majority of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer are candidates for breast conserving therapy. One of the options for radiation treatment following breast conserving surgery is partial breast irradiation (PBI). PBI reduces the irradiated tissue volume and decreases total treatment time. Appropriate patient selection for this technique is critical. This study evaluates the influence of preoperative breast MRI on patient selection for PBI. Materials/Methods: Between May 2004 and June 2009, 713 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer underwent a pre-operative bilateral breast MRI (median age 63, range, 25 - 91). Of this cohort of patients, 547 women (77%) were deemed eligible for PBI based on the NSABP B39 inclusion criteria using physical examination, mammogram and/or ultrasound. The NSABP B39 criteria used to assess patients includes tumor size ≤3 cm, ≤3 positive lymph nodes, negative surgical margins, no contralateral breast cancer, and lack of multicentric disease defined as additional disease >4 cm from the original tumor volume or disease within a different quadrant. The breast MRIs of all patients deemed eligible for PBI by these criteria were then reviewed to determine the impact of the MRI findings on patient eligibility for PBI. All patients had pathological assessment to correlate with MRI findings. Results: Based on the NSABP B39 inclusion criteria, 547 patients (77%) were considered to be appropriate candidates for PBI without the use of MRI. MRI findings led to pathologically proven additional disease that altered the recommendations for PBI in 136 patients (25%; 95% CI, 21 - 29%). Mammographically occult breast cancer was biopsy proven in the ipsilateral breast in 113 women (21%). Of these women, 57 (10%) were found to have more extensive disease than originally noted prior to MRI and 65 patients (12%) had multicentric disease detected in the ipsilateral breast. In addition, contralateral breast cancer was detected in 25 women (5%) based on the MRI results. Conclusions: Through initial evaluation, 547 women were deemed eligible for PBI. Further evaluation with pre-operative MRI showed 25% of patients were found to be ineligible for PBI because of breast MRI findings. Of the women initially deemed eligible for PBI, MRI detected additional ipsilateral breast cancer in 21% of women, 12% with multicentric breast cancer, and 10% with more extensive local disease. Contralateral breast cancer was discovered in 5%. Bilateral breast MRI complements the initial clinical evaluation in determining eligibility for PBI by identifying occult disease in patients for whom PBI may be inappropriate."
"Krauss, D. J., et al.",2005,MRI-based volumetric assessment of cardiac anatomy and dose reduction via active breathing control during irradiation for left-sided breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Heart dose-volume analysis using computed tomography (CT) is limited because of motion artifact and poor delineation between myocardium and ventricular space. We used dedicated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify exclusion of left ventricular (LV) myocardium via active breathing control (ABC) during left breast irradiation and to determine the correlation between irradiated whole heart and LV volumes. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients who completed adjuvant irradiation for early-stage left breast cancer participated. Treatment consisted of 45 Gy to the entire breast using ABC followed by a 16-Gy electron boost to the lumpectomy cavity. Patients underwent planning CT scans in free breathing (FB) and moderate deep inspiration breath hold (mDIBH). Electrocardiogram-gated cardiac MRI was performed in the treatment position using α-cradle immobilization. MRI scans were acquired in late diastole (LD), mid-diastole (MD), and systole (S) for both FB and mDIBH. After image fusion with the patients' radiation therapy planning CT scan, MRI LV volumes were defined for the three examined phases of the cardiac cycle, and comparative dose-volume analysis was performed. Results: Cardiac volume definition was found to differ significantly because of combinations of respiratory and intrinsic heart motion. The fraction of LV myocardium receiving 50% (22.5 Gy) of the prescribed whole breast dose (V22.5) was reduced by 85.3%, 91.8%, and 94.6% via ABC for LD, MD, and S, respectively. Linear regression revealed strong correlation between MRI-defined whole heart and LV V22.5 reduction via ABC, suggesting that LV myocardium accounts for up to approximately 50% of the excluded heart volume through this technique. Significant but weaker correlations were noted between CT-defined whole heart and LV V22.5 reductions with marked variability in the measurements of patients with larger amounts of heart in the treatment field. Conclusions: Cardiac MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in LV myocardium irradiated with the use of ABC. The correlation between reduction in V22.5 values for LV wall and CT-defined whole heart suggests that CT is adequate for determining which patients are likely to benefit from ABC treatment, but inaccuracies inherent to standard CT dictate that more detailed imaging studies such as MRI are required for accurate cardiotoxicity assessment.

"Kreike, B., et al.",2008,Continuing Risk of Ipsilateral Breast Relapse After Breast-Conserving Therapy at Long-Term Follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Currently, the local treatment of most patients with early invasive breast cancer consists of breast-conserving therapy (BCT). We have previously reported on the risk factors for ipsilateral breast relapse (IBR) in 1,026 patients treated with BCT after a median follow-up of 5.5 years. In the present study, we evaluated the IBR incidence and the risk factors for IBR after prolonged follow-up. Methods and Materials: We updated the disease outcome for all 1,026 patients using the clinical information collected from the medical registration of The Netherlands Cancer Institute and performed step-wise proportional hazard Cox regression analysis to identify the risk factors associated with an increased risk of IBR after BCT at long-term follow-up. Results: After a median follow-up of 13.3 years, 114 patients had developed an IBR as the first event. The IBR rate was 9.3% and 13.8%, respectively, at 10 and 15 years. Also, the increase in IBR was continuous without reaching a plateau, even after 15 years. Univariate analysis showed that involved surgical resection margins, young age, vascular invasion, and the presence and quantity of an in situ component are risk factors for IBR. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor-positive surgical resection margins (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-5.2, p = 0.0002) or the presence of vascular invasion (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2, p = 0.004) is the major independent risk factor for IBR. Conclusions: The data from long-term follow-up showed a constant increase in IBR among patients treated by BCT, even after 15 years, without reaching a plateau. Involved surgical resection margins and vascular invasion were the most important risk factors for IBR.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Krishnan, E. C., et al.",1990,Radiobiological advantages of an immediate interstitial boost dose in conservative treatment of breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Minimum surgery with irradiation is emerging as one of the main modalities of therapy for operable early breast cancer. Between June 1982 and June 1986, 110 breasts with Tis, T1 to T3 lesions have been treated at our institution with lumpectomy and interstitial irradiation to the tumor bed with Iridium-192 perioperatively followed by external beam irradiation. There have been two local recurrences at or near the vicinity of the primary, at a median follow-up of 60 months. To analyze the parameters that might have contributed to the local control, we have examined the treatment volumes, prescribed dose to the tumor bed, dose at the core of the tumor bed, and dose to the surrounding normal tissue. Immediate interstitial implant has the radiobiological advantage of delivering continuous low dose irradiation, immediately upon removal of gross tumor to residual foci. Implantation of the afterloading catheters intraoperatively facilitates accurate dose delivery and avoidance of geographical misses. By precise treatment of any residual foci, immediately upon removal of the gross mass, perioperative interstitial irradiation improves local control and by facilitating less radical surgical excision, leads to better cosmetic results."
"Krishnan, L., et al.",1987,Perioperative interstitial irradiation in the conservative management of early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Conservation of the breast in early breast cancer with limited resection and radiation is proving to be as effective as modified radical mastectomy in survival and in loco-regional control. Management at the University of Kansas Medical Center consists of an interstitial implant at the time of lumpectomy to facilitate perioperative irradiation with Iridium-192 to the tumor bed. An axillary node dissection is also performed at that time. Two to 3 weeks later external beam irradiation is delivered to the entire breast. One hundred and twenty-three breasts in 120 patients have been treated between June 1982 and June 1986. There were 49 pathological Stage I, 63 Stage II, 8 Stage III carcinomas, and 3 carcinomas in situ, consisting of 72 T1, 43 T2, 5 T3, and 3 TIS lesions. Patients have been followed for a median of 30 months. One patient had a 'true' recurrence in the breast. Another patient developed recurrence in a different quadrant. Ninety percent of the patients had good to excellent cosmetic results, 7% were considered fair, and 3% had poor results. Seven patients developed mild arm edema, 4 were found to have moderate edema, and 1 had severe arm edema. Our preliminary results indicate that interstitial irradiation immediately after excision results in excellent local control, with very satisfactory cosmesis and no morbidity due to the simultaneous excision and irradiation."
"Krishnan, L., et al.",1988,"Cosmetic results in early breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, peri-operative interstitial irradiation, and external beam radiation.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Patients with operable breast cancer were treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center with lumpectomy, peri-operative interstitial Iridium, and external beam radiotherapy, and concomitant adjuvant chemotherapy in a majority of node positive cases. Examination of the cosmetic results in 85 breasts followed for at least 2 years, at a median of 41 months revealed 20% to be excellent, 44% to be very good, 24% good, 9% fair, and 4% to have poor results. In this paper cosmesis is analyzed with reference to the size of the primary, its location, age of the patient, whether the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy, and whether the regional nodes were treated. In this group of patients, the size and the site of the primary, patient's age, and whether adjuvant chemotherapy was administered or not, did not adversely affect the aesthetic outcome. Treatment of the regional nodes gave a worse mean cosmetic score compared to the group in whom only the breast was treated (37.51 vs. 58.98 respectively, p < 0.001). Among the 11 patients with fair/poor cosmesis, all had regional nodal treatment, 7/11 had inner quadrant lesions, and 7/11 had lesions > T1. Further follow-up and accrual would be needed to confirm our results and affirm if other factors would change."
"Kron, T., et al.",2013,Can we predict plan quality for external beam partial breast irradiation: Results of a multicenter feasibility study (trans tasman radiation oncology group study 06.02).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Partial breast irradiation (PBI) after lumpectomy may be an option for selected patients with early breast cancer. A feasibility study of accelerated PBI delivered using external beam 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (RT) was undertaken at 8 Australasian centers. The present study evaluated the impact of patient, tumor, and RT technique-related factors on the quality of RT plans as determined by the dose-volume parameters of organs at risk. Methods and Materials: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. All RT plans were centrally reviewed using predefined dosimetric criteria before commencement and after completion of protocol therapy. The RT plans of 47 patients met the dose-volume constraints, and all 47 patients received PBI to a prescribed dose of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. The RT plan quality was determined by volumes of the ipsilateral whole breast, lung, and heart that received 50% and 95%; 30%; and 5% of the prescribed dose, respectively. Patient, tumor, and RT technique-related factors were investigated for association with the parameters of RT plan quality. Results: The ratio of the planning target volume to the ipsilateral whole-breast volume was significantly associated with the ipsilateral breast doses on multiple variable analyses. The distance of the postlumpectomy surgical cavity from the heart and lung were predictive for heart and lung doses, respectively. A distance between surgical cavity and heart of >4 cm typically resulted in <1% of the heart volume receiving 5 Gy or less. It was more difficult to meet the heart dose constraint for left-sided and medially located tumors. Conclusions: Partial breast irradiation using 3-dimensional conformal RT was feasible within the study constraints. The ratio of planning target volume to ipsilateral whole-breast volume and the distance of surgical cavity from the heart were significant predictors of the quality of treatment plan for external beam PBI.

"Kühr, M., et al.",2011,Potential impact of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the breast on patient selection for accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) after breast-conserving therapy is currently under investigation in prospective randomized studies. Multifocality and multicentricity are exclusion criteria for APBI. Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect ipsilateral and contralateral invasive tumor foci or ductal carcinoma in situ in addition to conventional diagnostic methods (clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasonography). The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative MRI on patient selection for APBI. Methods and Materials: From 2002 to 2007, a total of 579 consecutive, nonselected patients with newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer received preoperative breast MRI in addition to conventional imaging studies at the Bonn University Breast Cancer Center. In retrospect, 113 patients would have met the criteria for APBI using conventional imaging workup (clinical tumor size ≤3 cm; negative axillary lymph node status; unifocal disease; no evidence of distant metastases; no invasive lobular carcinoma, ductal and lobular carcinoma in situ, or Paget's disease). We analyzed the amount of additional ipsilateral and contralateral tumor foci detected by MRI. Results: MRI detected additional tumor foci in 8.8% of patients eligible for APBI (11 tumor foci in 10 of 113 patients), either ipsilateral (n = 7, 6.2%) or contralateral (n = 4, 3.5%). In 1 patient, MRI helped detect additional tumor focus both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. Conclusions: Preoperative breast MRI is able to identify additional tumor foci in a clinically relevant number of cases in this highly selected group of patients with low-risk disease and may be useful in selecting patients for APBI.

"Kumar, R., et al.",2019,Clinical Cosmetic and HR-QOL Evaluation of Conformal Breast Boost Radiotherapy in Early Breast Cancer: A Phase II Randomized Study Between Electrons and Photons.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant whole breast radiation (RT) is the standard of care in early breast cancer (EBC). Tumor bed boost RT improves local control and can be delivered by electron, photon, or brachytherapy. We conducted a phase II randomized study to compare electrons and photons for conformal breast boost RT after whole breast RT in EBC patients. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical acute toxicity, cosmesis, and impact on HR-QOL between electron and photon as conformal boost RT. Materials/Methods: Thirty patients aged ≥ 18 years with EBC after BCS and Axillary dissection were accrued in the study after IRB approval. All patients received whole breast RT of 50 Gy/ 25 fractions/ 5 weeks with forward planning IMRT. Patients were randomly assigned to receive conformal boost of 16 Gy/ 8 fractions/ 1.5 weeks with electron therapy (Arm A) or 3DCRT photon (Arm B). Simulation and contouring was done as per the RTOG guidelines. Acute toxicity, Cosmetic assessment, and HR-QOL assessment was evaluated with RTOG criteria, Harvard Cosmesis Scale, and EORTC BR-23 questionnaire respectively. Dosimetric comparison of conformal RT was done between the arms. Results: 30 patients were accrued in the study and 15 patients were allocated in each arm. All patients received planned treatment and were eligible for analysis. Median follow-up was 15 months. Median age was 45 years in both arms. Median tumor size was 3.2 cm and 3.4 cm in Arm A and Arm B respectively. The dosimetry and clinical toxicity were similar in both arms in whole breast RT. At treatment completion, grade III/IV skin toxicity was seen in 3 patients in arm A and 5 patients in arm B, indicating slightly higher toxicity with 3D-CRT Photon (p=0.2). Subcutaneous toxicity was similar in both arms. Excellent or good cosmesis at 3 months was seen in 12 patients and 10 patients in Arm A and Arm B respectively. Excellent or good cosmesis at 6 months was seen in 13 patients and 12 patients in Arm A and Arm B respectively. QOL scores were similar in both arms at baseline, treatment completion, at 3 months and at 6 months. Mean Radiation Conformity Index (RCI) was 0.937 and 0.961 in electron and photon respectively (p=0.04) and mean Dose Homogeneity Index (DHI) was 0.933 and 0.962 in electron and photon respectively (p=0.04). Ipsilateral lung and heart doses were significantly less with 3DCRT photon verses electron. The mean ipsilateral lung volume receiving 2 Gy (V2Gy) was 6.32% in 3-DCRT photons verses 21.66% in electrons (p=0.02). Conclusion: Breast boost RT can be delivered with photons and electron beam with equivalent clinical, cosmetic and QOL outcomes. Photon has slightly increased skin toxicity probably due to slightly large volume of non-target breast receiving RT, but overall skin, subcutaneous toxicity and cosmesis at 6 months is similar in both arms. 3DCRT photon boost has better PTV coverage, RCI, DHI than electron with lesser dose to OAR. Thus, in centers without electron beam, photon can be used effectively for tumor bed boost."
"Kumar, R. J., et al.",2015,Updated results of a prospective cohort study on intraoperative radiation therapy for early breast cancer at a single-institution.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Targeted Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) has been explored in clinical studies and used as an alternative to conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI) in early stage breast cancers. This study utilized the ASTRO 2009 consensus and the TARGIT-A and TARGIT- B criteria in selecting patients. We report the early radiation treatment related outcomes of our single institution prospective cohort study using the Intrabeam system. Materials/Methods: All eligible patients since September 2011 were entered consecutively into the cohort. Patients meeting the criteria of the ASTRO consensus, aside from age ≥ 60, and the TARGIT-A trial received IORT as the sole and definitive radiation treatment. If surgical pathology revealed findings incompatible with IORT treatment alone, then whole breast external beam radiation (EBRT) was added without a boost. IORT related complications, cosmesis, and early oncologic outcomes were assessed. Locoregional recurrence and toxicities were compared to TARGIT- A with a chi-square goodness of fit test, using the TARGIT-A outcomes as expected values. Patient characteristics were also compared to TARGIT-A. Results: A total of 80 patients have been followed prospectively after having received breast IORT treatment with a median follow-up of 2.77 years. 73% of patients received IORT as their only form of radiation treatment. The remainder (27%) received additional whole breast radiation, as the patients did not fit the TARGIT-A or ASTRO consensus guidelines for partial breast irradiation. There were three local recurrences (3.75%) noted in the treated breast. All three recurrences took place about 2 years post-IORT treatment. In TARGIT-A, the 5-year risk for local recurrence was 3.3% (95% CI 2.1-5.1). However, after a median follow up of 2.4 years, the incidence of locoregional recurrence was 31 out of 1679 patients (1.8%). When comparing the incidence of locoregional recurrence in our cohort with the TARGIT-A cohort, there was no statistical difference (p= 0.19). Patient toxicities were also evaluated. There was no statistical difference in the rates of hematoma, seroma, and skin breakdown or delayed wound healing (p= 0.82, 0.60, and 0.87 respectively). Infection requiring IV antibiotics or surgical intervention and RTOG toxicity of grade 3 or 4 were found to be statistically different (p= 0.003 and 0.011 respectively). To measure cosmesis, the Harvard Breast Cosmesis scoring system was used. In patients that had documented breast cosmesis scores, 76% of patients had excellent cosmesis, and 24% had good cosmesis. Conclusion: Treatment outcomes in patients that received IORT are comparable to the results of the TARGIT-A trial with respect to locoregional control and patient toxicities. Excellent and good cosmetic outcomes were achievable in this early report of our study. (Table Presented)."
"Kunkler, I. H., et al.",2012,Impact of screening and risk factors for local recurrence and survival after conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early breast cancer: Results from a large series with long-term follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To investigate conventional prognostic factors for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), distant metastasis (DM), and survival after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) in screen-detected and symptomatic cases on surveillance up to 25 years. Patients and Methods: A total of 1812 consecutive patients in three cohorts (1981-1989, 1990-1992, and 1993-1998) with T12N01M0 invasive breast cancer were treated with BCT (median follow-up, 14 years). Tumor type and grade were reviewed by a single pathologist. Hormone receptor status was measured by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess independent prognostic variables for relapse and survival. Results: A total of 205 IBTR occurred, with 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year actuarial relapse rates of 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.35-5.5%), 8.4% (95% CI 7.1-9.8%), 14.1% (95% CI 12.0-16%), and 17.4% (95% CI 14.5-20.2%). Number of nodes, young age, pathologic tumor size, and multifocality were significant factors for IBTR. Three hundred seventy-eight patients developed DM. The actuarial metastatic rate was 12% at 5 years and 17.9% at 10 years. Young age, number of positive nodes, pathologic tumor size, and tumor grade were significant factors for DM relapse. When conventional prognostic indices were taken into account screen-detected cancers showed no improvement in overall relapse or survival rate compared with symptomatic cases but did show a reduced risk of DM after IBTR. After 10 years IBTR relapse continued at a constant rate of 0.87% per annum. Conclusions: The Edinburgh BCT series has shown that screen-detected invasive breast cancers do not have significantly different clinical outcomes compared with symptomatic cases when pathologic risk factors are taken into account. This suggests that these patients be managed in a similar way.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Kurtz, J. M., et al.",1987,The second ten years: Long-term risks of breast conservation in early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"A retrospective cooperative study was undertaken to analyze the fate of 300 clinical Stage I and II breast cancer patients who were alive and apparently cured with both breasts preserved, 10 years following primary limited surgery with irradiation. All patients had been treated by tumor excision, with or without axillary dissection, followed by megavoltage radiation therapy. Follow-up ranged from 10.5 to 26 years, median 14.5 years. The overall actuarial survival (Kaplan-Meier) of the 300 'cured' patients was 86% at 15 years and 78% at 20 years, with 38.5% of deaths attributable to breast cancer. The actuarial probability of remaining free of metastatic disease was 91% at both 15 and 20 years, independent of age or clinical stage. Sixteen patients (5.3%) developed recurrent cancer in the treated breast beyond the tenth year, the actuarial probability of remaining free of breast recurrence being 94% and 90% at 15 and 20 years, respectively. Contralateral breast cancers developed during the second decade in 5 patients, with a cumulative risk of 6.5% at 20 years. Significant treatment-related problems appeared during the second decade in 5 patients, including one chest wall sarcoma; all of these patients had received at least 60 Gy to breast and regional nodal areas. A comparison of these results with those in the literature allowed the following conclusions to be drawn: (a) the risk of death, as well as breast cancer mortality during the second decade, are similar for both conservatively and radically treated patients with Stage I and II breast cancer; (b) The risk of contralateral breast cancer is not greater than that observed following primary radical surgery without radiation therapy; (c) Ipsilateral breast 'recurrences' continue to occur at about 1% per year during the second decade. Such late recurrences are highly operable and have a favorable prognosis; (d) Late progression of treatment-related sequelae is uncommon. This analysis supports the continued use of breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy in the treatment of Stage I and II breast cancer."
"Kurtz, J. M., et al.",1983,Late breast recurrence after lumpectomy and irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"For 276 patients with early breast cancer followed from 10-21 years after lumpectomy and radiotherapy, the recurrence rate in the treated breast was 15.6%, and 7.2% developed contralateral breast cancer. Only 63% of breast recurrences occurred within 5 years, and the remainder were 'late failures', with 5 of the 43 recurrences observed after 10 years. The proportion of failures occurring late was greater for T1 than for T2 tumors (53% vs 25%). Twenty-six percent of early recurrences were inoperable, and an adverse impact of early recurrence on 10-year survival was clearly demonstrable. Late recurrences were all operable and did not appear to be associated with decreased survival. Only 16 of the 36 patients (44%) with operable breast recurrence ever developed metastatic disease, and 5-year survival following salvage therapy was 62%. Although the treated breast remains at continuous cancer risk even beyond 5 years, the prognosis of late recurrence appears quite similar to that of contralateral breast cancer. We do not consider the phenomenon of late recurrence to lend support to a policy of primary mastectomy, just as the existence of contralateral breast cancer does not justify routine 'prophylactic' contralateral mastectomy."
"Kutcher, G. J., et al.",1996,Treatment planning for primary breast cancer: A patterns of care study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The 1989 Patterns of Care Study included treatment planning for early breast cancer. A Consensus Committee of radiation physicists and oncologists determined current guidelines and developed questionnaires to determine treatment planning and delivery processes used by the participating institutions (e.g., use of portal films). This article presents and analyzes the results of that survey. Methods and Materials: The survey included 449 respondents, distributed as follows: 136 (30%) from Strata I (academic facilities); 169 (38%) from Strata II (hospital based facilities); and 144 (32%) from Strata III (freestanding facilities). The treatment planning procedures surveyed included: whether individualized tissue compensators are used, whether inhomogeneity corrections are used in dose calculations, the use of computerized tomography, whether isodose distributions for external beam tangents and interstitial implants are generated, the use of lymphoscintigraphy, immobilization devices, simulations, portal films, etc. Results: The survey results demonstrated that out of 305 patients from Strata I and II institutions, 237 (78%) had simulated tangential fields. Consistent with this finding is that 76% of patients from Strata I and II institutions were immobilized, while only 51% of Strata III patients were. Moreover, only 18 out of the 449 (4%) of cases did not have any type of external beam dose distribution calculated - presumably, in these cases missing tissue compensation would be unlikely. On the other hand, 41% of the Strata II, 27% of Strata III, but only 19% of Strata I (p < 0.0002) cases received CT. Surprisingly, 19% of the Strata I, 35% of the Strata II, and 25% of the Strata III (p = 0.0011) patients received lymphoscintigraphy, perhaps reflecting the use of wide tangents to encompass the internal mammary nodes in these patients. In terms of optimizing treatments, 74% of Strata I, 70% of Strata II, and 78% of Strata III patients had wedges used on both tangential fields, although in 5, 12, and 14%, respectively, no beam modification of any sort was used. Furthermore, it should be noted that in 7% of the Strata I, 23% of Strata II, and 37% of Strata III cases there was no attempt to reduce the divergence of the tangential fields into the lung. On the other hand, if one considers the 135 (of 449) patients where matching of the tangential and supraclavicular fields was applicable, 41% of Strata I, 22% of Strata II and 46% of Strata III patients had those fields matched in a vertical plane, which would involve sophisticated alignment procedures. Quality control of treatment delivery was high: 97% of all surveyed received portal films at least once. The use of thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) to measure the dose to the contralateral breast was of little interest: only 4 of the 305 Strata I and II patients received invivo measurements. Conclusions: This national survey has established the patterns of treatment planning for early breast cancer. It shows a generally consistent approach - although a number of statistically significant variations have been identified."
"Lai, S. F., et al.",2016,Analyses of the clinical outcomes and cardiovascular events in elderly early breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery: A nationwide population-based study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) following breast conserving surgery (BCS) has been demonstrated to decrease the locoregional recurrence and to improve the overall survival for early breast cancer patients. However, left-side breast cancer RT may cause cardiovascular events and further influence the life expectancy, especially for elderly patients with competing comorbidities. In this study, we assessed the incidence of cardiovascular disease and the clinical outcome between elderly patients with early breast cancer who received BCS and RT and those received BCS alone. Materials/Methods: A nationwide population-based study was conducted using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Data were collected from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2011, which includes detailed medical records of more than 23 million insured enrollees. Patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer who were 70 years or older and had received BCS were included. Cumulative incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated after adjusting for competing mortality. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of major cardiovascular events. Major cardiovascular events were defined as a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease or patients who underwent procedures to restore and improve blood flow including angioplasty, stent placement (percutaneous coronary revascularization) or coronary artery bypass surgery. Results: Among 49,509 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, we identified 4,627 patients who were 70 years and older between January 2000 and December 2011. Detailed information of 1355 patients who had stage I, II disease and had received BCS were obtained as our study cohort. Among them, 398 patients (29.4%) received BCS and adjuvant RT (RT-treated cohort) and 772 patients (70.6%) received BCS alone (RTuntreated cohort). Hormone therapy was prescribed in 1088 patients (80.3%) of these patients. The median follow-up time was 7.1 year in the RT-treated cohort, whereas the median follow-up time for RT-untreated cohort was 9.3 year. There were no significant differences in recurrence rate, breast cancerespecific survival, or overall survival (OS) between these two groups. The 10-year OS for RT-treated cohort and for RTuntreated cohort was 63%, and 61%, respectively ( P = 0.26). However, the trend of higher major cardiovascular events was found in the RT-treated cohort (HR, 1.37; 95% CI: 0.94-1.99; P = 0.09) using modified Cox regression analysis. Conclusion: Our results indicate that for early breast cancer patients with 70 years and older after BCS, the clinical outcomes are similar between RT-treated cohort and RT-untreated cohorts. RT should be assessed individually along with an assessment of benefits and risks of treatment, such as cardiovascular events, for elderly early breast cancer patients with BCS."
"Lai, Y., et al.",2014,Analysis of health-related quality of life in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer patients brings a number of associated complications. In this study, healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) and its determinants were assessed in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant RT. The aim of this study was to measure the change of quality of life (QOL) of breast cancer patients during active treatment of adjuvant RT and during follow-up period, with particular emphasis on the patient's situation at the end of RT. Materials/Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, a total of 1,150 consecutive, cross-sectional samples at our institution were enrolled. Health-related quality of life was measured by the Taiwan version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF assessment instrument (WHOQOLBREF). The assessment of HRQOL was performed before starting (baseline) and immediately at the end of adjuvant RT, and during follow-up period. Change scores from baseline were calculated, and positive values indicated an improvement of QOL. The patient data and outcome parameters were gathered from the hospital records for additional information. Results: The global scores of the four major domains remained stable at the end of adjuvant RT, except scores relating to items of “overall QOL” and “general health” which improved significantly during RT. On the other hand, a significant increase in physical health, psychological health, and environment was observed during follow-up period. The younger patients (< 45 years old) had lower scores on psychological and environmental domains. Having received mastectomy instead of breast conserving surgery (BCS) was associated with poorer HRQOL in psychological health and social relationship, especially in early stage (stage 0-I) breast cancer patients. Concerning single facets, early stage patients undergoing mastectomy got worse off on the aspects of negative feelings, self-esteem, concentration, personal relationships, and social support. Conclusions: There was no impairment of HRQOL at the end of adjuvant RT in breast cancer, suggesting acceptable side effects during RT. Improvement of HRQOL during follow-up period indicated that patients could be expected to leave the patient's role, recover from treatmentrelated toxicities, and return to normal activities. The physicians should have awareness of the importance of optimal surgical procedure for early stage breast cancer patients, and pay more attention in the socio-emotional aspects to improve their HRQOL."
"Lawenda, B. D., et al.",2003,Dose-volume analysis of radiotherapy for T1N0 invasive breast cancer treated by local excision and partial breast irradiation by low-dose-rate interstitial implant.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the toxicity of partial breast irradiation (RT) using escalating doses of low-dose-rate interstitial implant as the sole adjuvant local therapy for selected T1N0 breast cancer patients treated by wide local excision. The results of a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer study have demonstrated a significant local control benefit using external beam RT to 65 Gy compared with 50 Gy. Thus, the tolerance of escalating doses of partial breast RT should be determined, because this approach may become a standard treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Between 1997 and 2001, 48 patients with T1N0M0 breast cancer were enrolled into an institutional review board-approved Phase I/II protocol using low-dose-rate brachytherapy implants after wide local excision and lymph node staging surgery. Brachytherapy was started 3-4 days after surgery at a dose rate of 50 cGy/h, using 192Ir sources evenly spaced to cover 3 cm around the resection margins. Typically, 2-3 planes were used, with a median of 14 catheters (range 10-16). The total dose was escalated in three groups: 50 Gy (n = 19), 55 Gy (n = 16), and 60 Gy (n = 13). The implant volume was calculated and used to classify patients into quartiles: 76-127 cm3 (n = 12), 128-164 cm3 (n = 12), 165-204 cm3 (n = 12), and >204 cm3 (n = 12). Cosmesis, patient satisfaction, treatment-related complications, mammographic abnormalities, rebiopsies, and disease status were recorded at each scheduled patient visit. Results: The median follow-up for all patients was 23.1 months (range 2-43). Very good to excellent cosmetic results were observed in 91.8% of patients. Ninety-two percent of patients were satisfied with their cosmetic outcome and said they would choose brachytherapy again over the standard course of external beam RT. Six perioperative complications occurred: two developed bleeding at the time of catheter removal, two had abscesses, one developed a hematoma, and one had a nonhealing sinus tract requiring surgical intervention. Significant fibrosis (moderate-to-severe scarring and thickening of the skin and breast) was noted in only 4 patients; 1 had received 55 Gy and 3 had received 60 Gy. Abnormal posttreatment mammograms were seen in 19 patients. Eight patients underwent rebiopsy for abnormalities found either by mammography or on physical examination; all proved to be fat necrosis or post-RT changes. The rebiopsy rates appeared to correlate with doses ≥55 Gy (6 [75%] of 8 compared with 29 [60%]of 48 overall) and implant volumes ≥128 cm3 (7 [87.5%] of 8 compared with 36 [75%] of 48 overall). To date, no local, regional, or distant recurrences have been observed. Conclusion: Low-dose-rate implants up to 60 Gy were well-tolerated overall. With an implant dose of 60 Gy, the incidence of posttreatment fibrosis (25%) appeared to be increased. Only the long-term follow-up of this and other implant studies will allow an understanding of the total radiation dose necessary for tumor control and the volume of breast that requires treatment.

"Leborgne, F.",1995,Breast conservation treatment of early stage breast cancer: Patterns of failure.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This study retrospectively assesses the patterns of failure in conservatively treated early stage breast cancer patients by correlating various clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related factors with local, axillary, and distant relapse. Methods and Materials: Between 1973 and 1990, 796 patients (817 breasts) received breast conservation surgery followed by radiotherapy. Local recurrences were counted as events even if they occurred simultaneously or after the appearance of axillary or distant metastases. Results: The 10-year actuarial relative disease-free survival (DFS) rate for T1N0, T2N0, and T1-2N1 was 82%, 71%, and 54%, respectively. Stage N0 patients had a significant DFS advantage over N1 patients (p = 0.02). The 15-year actuarial local recurrence-free rate for T1 and T2 tumors was 82% and 87%, respectively (p = nonsignificant). Univariate analysis identified three significant risk factors for local relapse: (a) 48 breasts with tumors showing an extensive intraductal component had a crude local recurrence rate of 23% compared to 8% for 769 breasts without intraductal component (p = 0.0016); (b) the actuarial 10-year local recurrence-free rate for patients under age 40 years was 64% compared to 88% for patients over 40 years (p < 0.0001); (c) the 10-year actuarial local recurrence-free rate for 416 postmenopausal women without adjuvant tamoxifen was 83% compared to 97% for 107 postmenopausal women with tamoxifen (p = 0.0479). Salvage therapy for operable local recurrent patients resulted in a 8-year actuarial DFS rate of 47%, significantly lower than that obtained with primary treatment. The incidence of axillary relapse as the first sign of recurrence was 2%, and could be correlated with the lack of axillary dissection (p < 0.0000005) and primary tumor size (p = 0.03). Radiotherapy to the axilla did not influence axillary relapse. Actuarial 5-year DFS rate after treatment of isolated axillary recurrence was 27%. Axillary failure was a marker for distant failure. Contralateral breast cancer occurred in 8% of patients and did not have a detrimental effect on survival. Adjuvant tamoxifen decreased the 9- year actuarial incidence of contralateral breast cancer from 10% to 4% (p = 0.053). Conclusions: Tumors with extensive intraductal component, age under 40 years, and the omission of adjuvant tamoxifen in postmenopausal women increased local recurrence rate. Stage T2 and the lack of axillary dissection increased axillary recurrence rate. Stage N+ and local or axillary relapse increased distant failure rate. Axillary irradiation did not influence locoregional control nor survival. Improved therapy is needed for relapsing patients."

Timeliness of RT treatment can impact patient satisfaction. The objectives of this study are to assess 1) patient satisfaction of their breast RT, 2) patient preference for timing of RT start after Ct simulation (CTSim), and 3) factors that influence patient stress and quality of life. Materials/Methods: Women undergoing whole breast RT were given a survey before RT start and at treatment completion. Patients were offered treatment either through the conventional process (ConvProcess), where RT starts within 1-2 weeks of CTSim, or the QuickStart (QS) process, where RT starts 1 day after CTSim. The pre-treatment (PRE-Tx) survey included social and demographic questions and the post-treatment (POSTTx) survey included questions relating to social climate and patient satisfaction. Questions of RT start preference, stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]) and quality of life (Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale [IIRS]), were assessed both at PRE and POST-Tx. Analysis of covariance was used to determine if RT process impacted PSS and IIRS, and t-tests were used as a secondary analysis. Fisher's Exact test was used where appropriate. Results: 96 patients completed the PRE-Tx survey and 88 completed both surveys (QS process n = 28; ConvProcess n = 60). All patients indicated they had a positive experience with the RT team (strongly agree-64%; agree-36%) and would recommend their care (strongly agree-75%; agree-25%). At PRE-Tx, 94% of the QS patients preferred to start RT within a day of CTSim compared to 16% of ConvProcess patients. The preference of ConvProcess patients changed significantly compared to QS patients at POST-TX (P<0.0001); 63% of ConvProcess and 96% of QS patients strongly agreed/agreed that given a choice they would prefer to start RT the next day after CTSim. The overall PSS for all patients were not different PRE and POST-Tx (P = .8) and stress levels did not differ significantly between QS and ConvProcess patients (P = .76). For both groups, health was the most common stress. The IIRS for ConvProcess patients was 37.6 (PRE-TX) and 39 (POST-TX), and for QS patients was 32 (PRE-TX) and 31.8 (POST-TX); there was no difference in IIRS of ConvProcess and QS patients (P = .2). However, subscales of IIRS showed an increase in illness interference with aspects of Physical Recreation and Social relationships for ConvProcess patients compared to QS patients (P = .03). Conclusion: Women undergoing whole breast RT were satisfied with their care and preferred to start RT quickly following their CTSim. Their strongest stressor was health and their stress levels were unchanged at RT completion. Patient involvement and selection of RT timing may impact on their views of how treatment interferes with their lifestyle and social relationships."
"Lee, G., et al.",2015,Prospective evaluation of normal tissue toxicity associated with breast boost in early-stage breast cancer radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The addition of a tumor-bed boost following whole breast radiation therapy (RT) in breast-conserving therapy can reduce local recurrence, but is associated with increased risk of toxicity. The objective of this longitudinal study was to prospectively record detailed radiation-induced toxicities in women treated with whole breast RT with or without a sequential boost, and determine the treatment and patient factors associated with breast-related late toxicities. Materials/Methods: This REB approved study included women with breast tumors previously treated with 50 Gy/25±10 Gy, 40 Gy/16±12.5 Gy, or 42.40 Gy/16±10 Gy. Breast RT was planned and delivered using intensity modulated RT. The tumor bed was contoured for boost treatment, delivered using a mixed photon and electron direct appositional technique. Breast-related toxicities were prospectively evaluated at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, and were defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Chemotherapy, RT dose, age, time since RT, and boost treatment parameters were assessed for association with late normal tissue toxicity. Multivariable marginal logistic regression analysis was performed on all patients and the boost cohort; p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: One hundred twenty-five post-lumpectomy women treated with whole breast RT were included: 58 (46%) had breast RT only and 67 (54%) had a subsequent boost. Patients who attended and had one or more toxicities at 3, 6, 12, or 24 months were 59/94 (63%), 61/100 (61%), 51/104 (49%), and 47/104 (45%), respectively. Chemotherapy, age, and RT tangential dose were not significant for the presence of side-effects. The addition of a boost increased the odds of having at least one side-effect by nearly 2-fold (OR=1.97; p=.015). The odds of any side-effects reduced over time (OR=0.67 per year; p=.012). Within the boost cohort, side-effects increased significantly with electron energies >9MeV (OR=2.66) but decreased with time from RT (OR=0.55 per year); while no impact was observed with chest wall thickness, seroma depth, dosimetric hotspot, areola/nipple in-field, and boost field size. Compared to the breast lower outer quadrant, boost to the upper inner (OR=4.82) and upper outer quadrants (OR=3.37) significantly increased the odds of side-effects. Conclusion: Whole breast RT treated with standard fractionation or hypofractionation were not significantly different with respect to RT-induced late toxicity. The addition of a breast boost nearly doubled the risk of any breast-related late toxicity, with reduction in these side effects noted over time. Where possible, boost treatments should be tailored to avoid sensitive normal breast regions and without the use of high electron energy to minimize late toxicities."
"Lee, J., et al.",2012,Improved local control rate in 3-dimensional radiation therapy era in early breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): This study comprehensively reviewed the clinical data and treatment outcomes of early breast cancer of one institution. We focused on the local recurrence rate and survival according to treatment regimens. Materials/Methods: Between 2003 and 2008, total 201 patients with stage I, II early breast cancer were included. One-hundred and ten patients were treated with breast-conserving surgery and post-operative radiation therapy (BCT), 91 patients were treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM) alone. One surgeon operated all patients. Preoperative magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) was taken in 161 patients (80.1%). All patients had at least one approach of post-operative adjuvant therapy and 88 patients (43.8%) did chemotherapy combined with hormonal therapy. Results: The median follow-up time was 70.0 months (range, 38.9-112.6 months). There are no significant difference in 5-year overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) in BCT vs. MRM group (94.3% vs. 92.0%, p = 0.914, and 93.1% vs. 89.5%, p = 0.319, respectively). Especially, 5-year loco-regional relapse free survival (LRFS) is also identical in both groups (BCT vs. MRM, 92.1% vs. 87.4%, p=0.333). On the univariate analysis, T stage and multicentricity based on the preoperative MRI are the prognostic factors for LRFS in all patients (p = 0.036 and p = 0.029, respectively). The overall incidence of local recurrence (ipsilateral breast or chest wall) in BCT and MRM group were 1.8% (2/110) and 3.3% (3/91), respectively and they had relatively aggressive clinical features; large tumor (≥1cm), poorly differentiated (≤ moderately differentiated), young patients (≤ 45 years old) and high stage (≥IIA). Among total 37 patients (18.4%) with multicentric disease, 11 patients were included in BCT group and none of them had local recurrence. Conclusions: In previously reported landmark studies in 1970's and 1980's, there were no difference in survival between BCT and MRM but local recurrence rate was higher in BCT group than MRM. However, this result showed the very low local recurrence rate in BCT group even though some patients in BCT group had multicentric disease. The more precise RT technologies in 3-dimensional RT (3D-RT) era may be the reason. Recent years, 3D-RT present us exact radiation dose distribution and permit more accurate radiation delivery. Therefore, BCT can be a treatment option for the patients with even multicentric disease for selected cases."
"Lee, K. C., et al.",2015,Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) provides equivalent 5 year and 10 year outcomes regardless of molecular subtype.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): APBI is an accepted approach for selected patients with early stage breast cancer. Current ASTRO consensus guidelines for suitability include receptor status as a significant determinant. However, the impact of molecular subtype is not well defined. This study compares outcomes based on molecular subtypes in patients treated with APBI. Materials/Methods: A total of 474 patients were treated with APBI (n=57 interstitial, n=247 applicator-based, n=170 3D conformal) at a single institution between 1980 and 2012 who had documented estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2 receptor status. Luminal A (Lum A) was defined as ER or PR positive, grade 1/2, and Her2-neu negative. Luminal B (Lum B) was defined as ER or PR positive, grade 3, and Her2-neu negative. Her2 type was defined as ER/PR negative, Her2-neu positive. Local recurrence (LR), true recurrence/marginal miss (TRMM), elsewhere failure, distant metastases (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Median follow-up was 5.9 years (0.1-18.8) for the entire cohort (Lum A 5.9, Lum B 6.0, triple negative (TN) 5.7, Her2 6.1, and triple positive (TP) 7.4 years, p = 0.35). Median age was not significantly different between groups (Lum A 64, Lum B 70, TN 64, Her2 61, and TP 68 years, respectively; p = 0.28), although use of endocrine therapy (Lum A 75%, Lum B 68%, TN 12%, Her2 0%, and TP 80%; p < 0.001) and chemotherapy (Lum A 13%, Lum B 19%, TN 57%, Her2 57%, and TP 28%; p < 0.001) differed. The table demonstrates 5- and 10-year clinical outcomes between groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate no differences between LR, TRMM, elsewhere, DM, DFS, or CSS. Statistical significance seen for RR and OS were likely a result of relatively low patient numbers and events in the Her2 Type cohort. These outcomes for APBI are quite comparable across all molecular subtypes, with the caveat that Her2 positive patients were limited. (Table Presented)."
"Lee, P. Y., et al.",2016,A topology-based method to mitigate boost volume uncertainty for breast conservative therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): In patients with breast cancer receiving boost to tumor bed, there is no consistency between bony alignment and surgical clip of tumor bed during daily image guidance. We derived a topologybased approach to stratify patients with high risk of missing boost volume. This method would provide an accurate, efficient, and cost-effective clinical solution. Materials/Methods: Twenty patients with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled, and all received adjuvant radiation therapy with a simultaneous integrated boost modulated technique with prescribed dose of 5880 cGy to tumor bed and 5040 cGy to whole breast in 28 fractions. The delineation of tumor bed was defined by seroma and adjacent surgical clips on computed tomography simulation. A total of 580 on-board images were registered to the digital reconstruction radiography. Treatment target uncertainty for each patients were assessed by four components: namely systematic error (SE), and random error (RE), through anterior-posterior (AP), cranial-caudal (CC), left-right (LR) directions and couch rotation (CR). Body-mass factors including body weight (BW), body height, body mass index, volume of the breast, and volume of the tumor bed were analyzed. The median values were used as cutoff points to divide the groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to assess the predictive role of these factors for the treatment target uncertainty. Results: Higher BW (>57.6 Kg), larger breast volume (>446 cm3), and smaller volume of tumor bed (<19.2 cm3) were associated with larger displacements of the surgical clips in AP-RE ( P = 0.002), LR-SE ( P = 0.001), and CC-RE ( P = 0.028), respectively. Ten patients with 2 or more of these risk factors were defined as high risk group for missing boost volume, and the others with 1 or none were referred as low risk group. When on-line image guidance was aligned to bony structures, the SE of the displacement for surgical clips were 2.2 mm, 4 mm, 3.7 mm, 2 degree for high risk group in AP, CC, LR directions and CR, whereas 1.8 mm, 2.7 mm, 1.7 mm, 1.4 degree for low risk group. The RE were 1.8 mm, 2.3 mm, 2.2 mm, 1.5 degree for high risk group, while 1.3 mm, 1.9 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.1 degree for low risk group. To guarantee that 90% of patients will receive a minimum cumulative dose to tumor bed of at least 95% of the prescribed dose, the corresponding margin around tumor bed were 6.8 mm, 11.6 mm, and 10.8 mm for high risk group. For low risk group, the margin can be safely reduced to 5.3 mm, 8 mm, and 5.2 mm. Conclusion: Patients with a higher BW (>57.6 Kg), a larger breast volume (>446 cm3), and a smaller volume of tumor bed (<19.2 cm3) have greater degree of treatment target uncertainty in local boost. If cone-beam CT is not available, daily on-board image is still an accurate, efficient, and cost-effective way when adequate margin was added to the tumor bed."
"Lee, S. W., et al.",2016,Accelerated whole-breast irradiation is comparable to conventional fractionation in breast cancer patients with adverse features and is gentler in skin toxicity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast cancer is known to have low a/b ratios in tumor control and is as sensitive to fraction size as normal tissues. Accelerated (AWBI) and conventional whole breast irradiation (CWBI) was compared to verify if AWBI is as effective as CWBI in patients of early breast cancer with adverse prognostic features. Materials/Methods: We included 330 patients who received breastconserving surgery (BCS) and post-operative radiation therapy (RT) with AWBI for early breast cancer (pT1-2 and pN0-1a) from 2007 to 2010. These patients were matched to the corresponding 330 patients who received RT with CWBI by the year of BCS, stage, and age (3 years). The AWBI and CWBI were given with whole breast irradiation of 39 Gy and 50.4 Gy in 13 and 28 fractions, respectively. Sequential boosts to the tumor bed were done in all patients. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) in both fractionation groups. Results: The median follow-up time was 81.9 months (range, 3.8-119.7 months). There was no statistically significant difference between AWBI and CWBI groups in the distribution of age, T and N stages, resection margin, histologic grade, and molecular subtype. The 5-year IBTR rates for the AWBI and CWBI groups were 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively ( P = 0.54). There was no statistically significant difference between the HRs of AWBI and CWBI in all subgroups. The subgroups with adverse factors such as age < 50 (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.11-0.30), high tumor grade (0.77, 95% CI 0.18-3.25), non-luminal subtype (0.90, 95% CI 0.15-5.42), and omission of chemotherapy (0.95, 95% CI 0.09-10.53) had lower risk of IBTR in the AWBI group compared to the CWBI group. In comparison of mean toxicity grades for breast edema and erythema/hyperpigmentation, AWBI showed lower skin toxicities than CWBI until 2 years since radiation therapy completion. Conclusion: AWBI is comparable to CWBI in early breast cancer patients with adverse features such as high tumor grade and non-luminal subtype. Moreover, gentler skin toxicity was observed in AWBI."
"Leggett, H., et al.",2012,Dosimetric comparison of sequential electron versus simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) techniques for adjuvant breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the relative planning target volume (PTV) coverage and organ at risk (OAR) avoidance using sequential electron and SIB technique. Materials/Methods: Cases were identified from the hospital database, with a mixture of right and left sided tumors. De-identified computed-tomography (CT) simulation scans were transferred to a research drive. Organs at risk and PTV delineation was defined and/or reviewed by the treating Radiation Oncologist. The tumor bed was defined using imaging and histopathological information in addition to the wired scar, seroma or clip distribution on CT. A clinical target volume (CTV) was defined by adding a 5mm isotopic expansion to this structure excluding pectoral fascia and 5mm of soft tissue beneath skin. The boost PTV was generated using a 5- 7mm expansion CTV. The SIB technique consisted of a forward-planned conformal boost delivered to the tumor bed PTV to 60 Gy in 25 fractions, whilst concurrently treating the whole breast PTV to 45 Gy in 25 fractions. The sequential technique utilized a dose of 50 Gy in 25fractions to the whole breast followed by a 10 Gy boost to the tumor bed PTV using a direct electron field. CTV and PTV coverage for the two techniques was assessed based on V95 and V100. Doses to organs at risk including heart, lung, and contralateral breast were compared. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to compare the cohorts. Results: CT datasets were reviewed for 20 patients who underwent breast SIB between 2009 and 2011. An equal number of left and right sided treatment courses were assessed. One patient was excluded from the analysis, as their data was outlying due to large breast size and consequent inability to adequately cover the boost PTV with a sequential electron technique. Breast PTV coverage was superior using a SIB approach. V95% was 90.49% for SIB compared with 86.80% for sequential (p < 0.05). Similarly, coverage of the boost CTV was superior with an SIB approach with V95% of 99.95 compared with 94.29 for sequential (p < 0.05). Dose to OARs were similar using the SIB approach. Dose to lung was similar in both groups: V5 11%, mean lung dose 3 Gy. No significant differences were detected in heart V5 0.09 versus 0.11%. Conversely, maximum and mean dose to the contralateral breast were increased, 5.48 v 0.12 Gy (p = 0.48) and 0.55 versus 0.14 Gy respectively (p = 0.42). The dose per fraction delivered to heart is however much lower for the SIB approach. Conclusions: Use of a SIB approach in adjuvant radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer results in a dosimetric advantage with respect to PTV coverage when compared to a sequential electron boost. OAR avoidance is not compromised. However, dose to the contralateral breast is higher using this technique than a sequential electron boost."
"Lei, R. Y., et al.",2015,Patterns of surgical and radiation treatment for early-stage breast cancer in the state of colorado.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiation therapy (RT) provides an alternative to mastectomy for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. Data collected by the Colorado Central Cancer Registry (CCCR) is not currently available through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and has not hitherto been analyzed. There has also been a growing interest in the utilization patterns of mastectomy or BCS with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) vs. whole breast irradiation (WBI). We therefore investigated the use of mastectomy, BCS with WBI, and BCS with APBI in patients potentially eligible for APBI in Colorado. Materials/Methods: Stage 0-II breast cancer cases from 2004 to 2012 with tumor span ≤ 3 cm, negative surgical margins, and 0 positive lymph nodes were evaluated for associations between recorded surgical and radiation treatment and various patient characteristics. BCS cases with RT were characterized by dose as either APBI (3000-3999 cGy) or WBI (4000-6600 cGy). Results: 15,645 cases (539 BCS with APBI, 5529 BCS with WBI, and 9577 mastectomy) were evaluated. Age, race/ethnicity, payer, distance to the nearest radiation treatment facility, and rural/urban residence differed significantly across the treatment groups, while area poverty level (as defined by the 2010 US Census) was not associated with treatment type. Patients treated with mastectomy (mean age 58.2 yrs) were significantly younger (p < 0.001) than patients treated with BCS with RT (mean age for WBI 62.5 and APBI 62.4). There was a slightly higher proportion of mastectomy among Whites of Hispanic (61.9%) and non-Hispanic ethnicity (61.2%) and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (62.9%) than among Blacks/African American (60%) and American Indians/Alaskan Natives (59%). A greater proportion of patients with private insurance and Medicare received BCS with RT (38.8% and 41.42%) than patients with no insurance or Medicaid (36.8% and 34.25%). Patients who underwent mastectomy were, on average, 2.1 miles farther (p < 0.001) from the nearest radiation treatment facility compared to those who received BCS with WBI. The mean distance from treatment facility of patients who received BCS with APBI did not differ significantly from patients treated with BCS with WBI or mastectomy. Although a similar proportion of patients in urban and rural areas received BCS with APBI (3.4% and 3.3%), the proportion of patients treated with BCS with WBI and mastectomy differed (WBI 35.6% vs. 31.4%, mastectomy 60.9% vs. 62.8%). Conclusion: Socioeconomic factors of age, race/ethnicity, payer, distance to the nearest radiation treatment facility, and rural/urban residence differed significantly with the type of breast cancer care received by breast cancer patients in Colorado."
"Lemanski, C., et al.",2010,Intraoperative Radiotherapy in Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Results of the Montpellier Phase II Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We recently presented the intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) technique given as a reliable alternative to conventional boost radiation after breast-conserving surgery. The low crude numbers of recurrence in elderly patients led us to investigate the feasibility and the efficacy of this procedure as a sole treatment. Methods and Materials: We included 94 patients older than 65 years in this phase II trial. Among them, 42 patients presented with all the inclusion criteria, i.e., stages pT0 to pT1 and pN0, ductal invasive unifocal carcinoma, and tumor-free margin of >2 mm. IORT was delivered using a dedicated linear accelerator. One 21-Gy fraction was prescribed and specified at the 90% isodose, using electrons. In vivo dosimetry was performed for all patients. The primary endpoint was the quality index. Secondary endpoints were quality of life, local recurrences, cosmetic results, and specific and overall rates of survival. Results: The median follow-up was 30 months (range, 12-49 months), and median age was 72 years (range, 66-80 years). The median tumor diameter was 10 mm. All patients received the total prescribed dose. No acute grade 3 toxicities were observed. Endpoints for all but one patient corresponded to acceptable quality index criteria. Pretreatment quality-of-life scores were maximal, and no significant decrease was observed during follow-up. Cosmesis was good to excellent at 6 months. Two patients experienced recurrence but underwent salvage mastectomy. Conclusion: Our results confirm that exclusive partial-breast IORT is feasible for treating early-stage breast cancer in the elderly. IORT may be considered an alternative treatment for a selected population and offers a safe one-step treatment.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Lemanski, C., et al.",2006,Intraoperative radiotherapy given as a boost for early breast cancer: Long-term clinical and cosmetic results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The standard radiotherapy (RT) of breast cancer consists of 50 Gy external beam RT (EBRT) to the whole breast followed by an electron boost of 10-16 Gy to the tumor bed, but this has several cosmetic disadvantages. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) could be an alternative to overcome these. Methods and Materials: We evaluated 50 women with early breast cancer operated on in a dedicated IORT facility. Median dose of 10 Gy was delivered using 9-MeV electron beams. All patients received postoperative EBRT (50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions). Late toxicity and cosmetic results were assessed independently by two physicians according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event v3.0 grading system and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires. Results: After a median follow-up of 9.1 years (range, 5-15 years), two local recurrences were observed within the primary tumor bed. At the time of analysis, 45 patients are alive with (n = 1) or without disease. Among the 42 disease-free remaining patients, 6 experienced Grade 2 late subcutaneous fibrosis within the boost area. Overall, the scores indicated a very good quality of life and cosmesis was good to excellent in the evaluated patients. Conclusion: Our results confirm that IORT given as a boost after breast-conserving surgery is a reliable alternative to conventional postoperative fractionated boost radiation.  Inc."
"Leonard, K. L., et al.",2011,Reduced coverage of axillary level I lymph nodes with whole breast irradiation in the prone versus supine position.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recent reports dispute the necessity of completion axillary dissection in early stage breast cancer patients with positive sentinel nodes undergoing breast conservation surgeries (ACOSOG Z-0011). Elimination of axillary dissection in these patients would highlight the importance of adequate dosing to the axilla with tangential whole breast irradiation (WBI). Prone breast positioning is becoming common to reduce dose to lung and heart, but may also reduce dose to axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Materials/Methods:Women with early stage breast cancer treated with WBI in the prone position at our institutions were identified. Anatomic considerations supported treatment in the prone position. Supine controls were matched for treating physician, breast side, and fractionation (conventional vs. Canadian). All patients underwent 3D CT-based planning with tangential fields designed to encompass the whole breast. Level I, II, and III ALNs were retrospectively contoured according to the RTOG contouring atlas. Clips marking surgically removed ALNs were also contoured. Treatment plans developed for each patient were retrospectively analyzed. The volume receiving 95% (V95%) and 90% (V90%) of the prescribed dose was calculated for each axillary level. When present, dose to axillary surgical clips was calculated. Results: Treatment plans for 46 women (23 prone and 23 supine) were reviewed. Prescribed dose was 46 Gy in 23 fractions (n = 16), 42.7 Gy in 16 fractions (n = 18), or 50-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions (n = 12). Level I ALNs received dose from standard tangents in either the prone or supine position. The mean V95% was significantly lower for patients treated in the prone position (14%) than in the supine position (37%) (p<0.0001). Similarly, mean V90% was lower in patients treated in the prone position (21% vs. 50%; p<0.0001). Among women treated in the prone position, V95% was less than 10% in 14 women and 0% in 6 women. Generally, Level II and III ALNs did not receive a significant portion of prescribed dose in either position. Surgical clips marked the ALNs removed at surgery in 8 and 9 patients treated in the prone and supine position, respectively. All such nodes were contained within axillary level I. At least 90% of prescribed dose was delivered to axillary clips in all patients treated in the supine position (V90% = 100%) but in only one patient treated in the prone position. Conclusions: Only axillary level I lymph nodes (and the surgically relevant ALNs included within) receive adequate coverage from WBI delivered with standard tangents. Level I receives significantly better coverage when patients are treated in the supine vs. prone position. Nodal coverage may become an important consideration as sentinel node sampling alone replaces full level I and II axillary dissection."
"Leonard, K. L., et al.",2012,Breast boost using noninvasive image-guided breast brachytherapy versus en face electrons: A matched pair analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The advantages of image guidance and the dosimetric characteristics of breast boost delivered with noninvasive imageguided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) have been examined and early registry data has been reported. The present analysis compares clinical outcomes and acute and late toxicity in patients treated with NIBB boost to those in patients treated with electron boost. Materials/Methods: Women with early stage breast cancer treated with whole breast irradiation (WBI) and NIBB boost at our institution were identified. Controls matched for age, stage, chemotherapy use, breast size, fractionation, medical comorbidities, and smoking status were identified from among all patients treated with WBI and electron boost at our institution. Acute toxicity, late toxicity, and oncologic outcomes were reviewed for each patient and matched control. The chi-squared test was used to evaluate associations between patient factors and acute toxicity. The McNemar non-parametric test was used to evaluate for marginal homogeneity between matched pairs with respect to acute and late toxicity. Results: Eighty patients were included in the analysis: 40 patients treated with NIBB boost between May 2009 and February 2012 and 40 matched controls treated during the same interval. Mean age in both groups was 58 years. The majority of patients had stage I breast cancer (n = 48) or DCIS (n = 20). Both NIBB boost and electron boost were well tolerated with reports of periareolar or nipple discomfort in 9 patients in each group during the course of treatment. Three patients required a treatment break in each group. Grade 2+ desquamation developed in 35% of patients treated with NIBB boost and in 45% of patients treated with electron boost (OR= 0.6 (0.18 - 1.82); p = 0.453). Breast size, excision volume, and electron energy predicted for acute desquamation (p = 0.003, p = 0.05, and p = 0.02, respectively); patient age, use of chemotherapy, and boost method (NIBB vs. electron) did not (p = 0.12, p = 0.63, and p = 0.45, respectively). Median follow-up was 7 months. There was no difference in the rate of subacute (< 90 day) grade 1 skin toxicity between those treated with NIBB boost and electron boost (48% vs. 60%, respectively; p = 0.55). Among the 18 pairs with greater than 6 months follow-up, NIBB boost and electron boost were associated with similar rates of late grade 1 skin toxicity (17% vs. 17%, p=0.62), grade 1 subcutaneous fibrosis (33% vs. 28%, p = 1), and good/excellent cosmesis (100% vs. 94%, p = 1). There were no in-breast tumor recurrences in either group. Conclusion: NIBB boost is associated with favorable clinical outcomes at least comparable to those seen with electron boost. Longer follow-up is needed to better assess late end points."

A., et al.",1989,Results of conservative surgery and radiation therapy for multiple synchronous cancers of one breast.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"A small number of patients with early stage breast cancer are found on presentation to have two or more separate carcinomas within the breast. To assess the effectiveness of conservative surgery and radiation therapy in these patients we compared treatment outcome among 10 patients with multiple lesions (21 cancers) and 707 patients with single lesions, treated at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy between 1968-1981. Median follow-up was 64 months and 75 months for the multiple and single lesion groups, respectively. In each patient with multiple lesions, but (or all 3) lesions had similar histologic features. Eight of these ten patients (80%) had an infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) compared to 72% of patients with single lesions. Six of these 8 patients with IDC had at least 1 lesion with an extensive intraductal component (EIC), compared to a 33% incidence of an EIC in solitary lesions. All lesions were grossly excised. Radiotherapy was given to the entire breast in all patients, with the majority also receiving a boost dose to the tumor bed site. Four of the 10 patients with multiple lesions recurred in the treated breast (40%) compared to 77 of the 707 patients (11%) with single lesions (p = 0.019, Fisher exact test). In the six patients with multiple lesions who had an EIC, three developed a local failure. In comparison, 43 of 167 patients (26%) with a single lesion with EIC developed a local failure. In patients with multiple lesions, 0 of 2 with IDC without an EIC, and 1 of 2 with histologies other than IDC had recurrence in the treated breast compared to 19 of the 342 (6%) and 15 of the 198 (8%) patients with single lesions with similar histologic features, respectively (p = NS). These results suggest that the presence of 2 or more separate primary tumors in the breast is associated with a high likelihood of local recurrence after treatment with conservative surgery and radiation therapy, even when all identified tumors are grossly resected. This may reflect the common finding of an EIC in these tumors. We conclude that the use of conservative surgery and radiation therapy for patients with more than one primary cancer in the breast should be considered with caution."
"Li, A., et al.",2013,An analysis of rapid review cases that failed to meet the RTOG 1005 contouring and doseevolume criteria.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Rapid reviews of the first cases entered on experimental arms of RTOG clinical trials are meant to ensure that the quality of treatment planning will support the conclusions for the primary endpoint. Institutions must pass the rapid review prior to treating the patient. We analyzed cases that failed the rapid review in the RTOG 1005 phase III trial for early stage breast cancer comparing accelerated hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) with concurrent boost (ARM II) versus standard WBI plus sequential boost (ARM I). Materials/Methods: Target volume and dose volume (DV) analysis forms, designed specifically for the rapid review process, with data for all the cases that failed to pass the contouring and/or dose volume (DV) criteria of RTOG 1005 were analyzed. The overall failure rate, and the reason and frequency for specific failure were studied. Results: A total of 145 cases were submitted for the rapid review of RTOG 1005 at the time of abstract submission with 51 cases (35%) failing to meet the compliance criteria. Among these cases, 40 (78%) became compliant on second submission, 8 cases required a third submission and 3 cases chose not to resubmit. Among the 51 failed cases at first submission, 45 cases (88%) did not meet either the contouring criteria alone or both contouring and DV criteria, and 6 cases (12%) did not meet the DV criteria alone. The number of structures that did not meet the contouring criteria was: one in 20 cases; two in 9 cases; three in 6 cases; four in 4 cases; five in 3 cases; six in one case, and seven in 2 cases. The most frequent structures that failed the contouring criteria were PTV-WB-EVAL (17 times); CTV-WB (11 times); PTV-WB (11 times), PTV-BOOST-EVAL (9 times); thyroid (8 times); PTV-SURG-BED-EVAL (8 times), and CTV-SURG-BED (6 times). Among the 6 cases that failed to meet the DV criteria alone, 5 cases were due to higher than permitted dose to the contralateral breast. For all the cases submitted, 26% (13/49) of IMRT cases and 15% (14/96) of 3DCRT cases failed the DV criteria. Conclusions: One third of rapid review cases on the RTOG 1005 trial (to date) failed to meet the protocol contouring and dosimetry compliance criteria on first submission. The PTV-WB-EVAL is the structure that failed most to meet criteria, while the DV constraint that was not met the most was the dose to the contralateral breast. In response, the protocol was amended by clarifying contouring guidelines and making the DV constraints for the contralateral breast more flexible. The high failure rate in the rapid review process on this large phase III trial demonstrates the need for rigorous QA. More standardization and pre-enrollment training on both contouring and dosimetry planning techniques may be helpful."
"Li, A., et al.",2017,"Lessons learned from the two-step QA process in NRG oncology/RTOG 1005, a phase 3 trial for early-stage breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): NRG/RTOG 1005 is a randomized phase III study for early stage breast cancer comparing accelerated hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) with concurrent boost to standard WBI plus sequential boost. Institutions had to pass a two-step QA process prior to treating patients, including (1) planning study based on a benchmark CT dataset with contours provided, and (2) rapid review of the first case, per radiation (RT) modality, entered onto the trial (with approval required prior to treatment). Frequencies and reasons for resubmissions are reported here in order to evaluate and improve the two-step QA process for future multi-institutional trials. Purpose/Objective(s): Seven radiation techniques, using 3D-CRT, IMRT, or simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) for WBI and/or boost, were allowed. A benchmark case with ≥ 1 unacceptable deviation and/or ≥ 2 variations acceptable, and rapid reviews with ≥ 1 unacceptable deviation required resubmissions until approved. Dose volume (DV) data for the benchmark study and the DV and contouring data for the rapid review process were analyzed. The overall rates, number of and reasons for resubmissions were studied. Results: The total accrual for this study was 2354 patients, with 352 institutions and 280 cases undergoing the benchmark and rapid review QA processes, respectively. Benchmark resubmission rates were similar for 3DCRT (37/205, 18%), IMRT (17/100, 17%), and SIB (21/119, 18%). In the first benchmark submissions, non-ideal ipsilateral lung DV values (V20) were the major reason for the failures for both 3DCRT and IMRT, while non-ideal mean heart doses and ipsilateral lung DV values were among the main reasons for the failures for SIB. Thirty-five percent of both contour (98/280) and DV (99/280) rapid reviews required at least one resubmission. The main reasons for resubmissions were unacceptable contours of the breast target volumes (PTV boost eval, Breast PTV eval, and CTV boost). There was no significant association between resubmissions for benchmarks and rapid reviews (P = 0.31, see Table 1); however, the rapid resubmission rate was higher for institutions that had to resubmit their benchmark than those that didn't (41% vs. 34%). Conclusion: One fifth of benchmark cases and one third of rapid review cases required resubmission to meet protocol dosimetry and contouring compliance criteria. The resubmission rate of the rapid review for the institutions that failed in the benchmark is slightly higher than that for the institutions passing the benchmark. These resubmission rates demonstrate the need for rigorous QA. More standardization and pre-enrollment training on both contouring and dosimetry planning techniques may be helpful."
"Li, X., et al.",2017,Accelerated hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation with concomitant daily boost using intensity-modulated radiation therapy in early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the feasibility and the related toxicity of hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation with a concomitant daily boost in early breast cancer women. Purpose/Objective(s): Between November 2015 and September 2016, 78 patients underwent accelerated hypofractionated adjuvant radiation after conservation surgery (pT1 or pT2, pN0) using IMRT. All patients received 46 Gy to the whole breast in 20 fractions/4 weeks with 2.3 Gy/fraction plus an additional concomitant daily boost of 0.5 Gy to the tumor bed, giving a total dose of 56 Gy. Toxicity was assessed at the end of radiation therapy and at 3 months using the RTOG/EORTC toxicity scale. Cosmetic results were assessed in agreement with the Harvard criteria. Results: Median follow-up was 7 months. At the end of radiation therapy, 80% showed grade 0-1 skin toxicity, 20% grade 2, and 0% grade 3. At 3 months of follow-up, grade 0 skin toxicity was observed in 60% of cases; grade 1 in 40%, and grade 2 in 0%. Late subcutaneous tissue toxicities were scored as grade 0 in 46%, grade 1 in 54%, and grade 2 in 0% of cases. 90% of patients showed excellent or good cosmetic results. Conclusion: In this prospective trial, we observed low local toxicity and excellent short-term cosmetic results. The accelerated hypofractionated schedule with a concomitant boost appears to be an acceptable alternative to the traditional longer schedule, although a much longer follow-up is needed to assess the local control rate."
"Libby, B., et al.",2011,Dosimetric comparison of Ir-192 to 50 kV X-rays for intraoperative breast brachytherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The TARGIT-A study reported equivalent initial local control and toxicity of early stage breast cancer treated intraoperatively with 50 kV x-rays as compared to standard external beam radiotherapy. Post-operative high dose rate (HDR) Ir-192 brachytherapy partial breast irradiation (PBI) has been widely performed using multiple commercially available applicators. To test the feasibility of developing an HDR-based breast IORT program we retrospectively compared the dosimetry of Contura Ir-192 HDR and Xoft 50kV IORT treatment plans. Materials/Methods: Five patients treated with Contura-based PBI had plans generated using the PTVand prescription dose of the TARGIT-A protocol-i.e.-20 Gy to a depth of 2 mm from the applicator. In these cases, the contour of the Contura balloon was expanded by 2 mm to create a 2 mm thick PTV. The PTV-eval is defined as a 1 cm expansion of the balloon, except for skin. The Xoft 50 kV x-ray source was also modeled in the BrachyVision treatment planning system, and the same plans were calculated assuming that the Xoft applicator coincided with the central lumen of the Contura balloon, with the same volumetric optimization parameters. The Dose-Volume parameters DXX refers to the dose D that the percent PTV Volume XX receives. The conformality is defined as (D95/D10)100. Results: A comparison of dosimetric parameters for each treatment type is shown in Table 1. For the Contura, the D99 and D95 averages 89.3%, and 93.0% of the prescribed dose, while it is only 72.9% and 86.6% (p=0.002, andp=0.002) of the prescription with the Xoft applicator. Likewise, the average conformality index is greater for the Contura plans 80.9 versus 71.4 (p=0.003) for Xoft, indicating a more homogeneous dose distribution within the PTV for Contura-based HDR treatment. Comparison of the average PTV-eval D95 for the two different applicators, also favored the Contura (p<0.001). Conclusions: This retrospective study shows the dosimetric feasibility of Contura-based HDR IORT. The multi-lumen capabilities show superior dosimetric results as compared to a stepping 50 kV x-ray source, and the multiple dwell positions within the Contura applicator are inherently superior to a single dwell position in the center of a balloon applicator.

"Lim, A. and K. J. Joseph",2019,Predicting Radiation-Adverse Effects Using Three-Dimensional Dose and Fractionation Data: Radiation Dermatitis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Predicting the radiation dose-toxicity relationship is important to patients, as iatrogenic toxicities affect patients’ quality of life. Patients need accurate estimates of both treatment efficacy and toxicity risk to make informed decisions about a proposed treatment. QUANTEC uses point dose-volume, and mean doses to predict radiation induced toxicities. These models do not account for major factors known to affect organ toxicity, such as dose per fraction, radiation field volume, and anatomic location of the dose within the organ of interest. This study evaluates utilizing 3 dimensional (3D) dose images, and fractionation data to predict radiation dermatitis in patients undergoing whole breast radiotherapy. Materials/Methods: One hundred and sixty patients underwent whole breast radiotherapy for ductal carcinoma in-situ or early stage breast cancer following breast conserving surgery. Patients were randomly separated into training or validation datasets. Three-dimensional radiation dose images and fractionation data were used to train a modified three-dimensional squeeze excitation residual neural network to predict radiation dermatitis grade. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the model’s performance. Results: Sixty seven patients had grade ≥ 2 radiation dermatitis, and 93 patients had grade ≤ 1 radiation dermatitis. The neural network model discriminated between radiation dermatitis grade ≤ 1 from grade ≥2 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 on the training dataset, and an AUC of 0.81 on the validation dataset. Conclusion: We have developed the first normal tissue complication probability model that utilizes 3D dose images and radiotherapy fractionation data to reasonably predict radiation dermatitis in patients undergoing whole breast radiotherapy. With advancements in 3D computer modelling, radiation oncologists will be able to better predict the probability and severity radiation toxicities compared to historical point dose-volume and mean dose toxicity models currently used in practice. With improved toxicity predictions, patients and physicians will be able to make more informed treatment decisions."
"Lim, M., et al.",2006,A prospective study of conservative surgery without radiation therapy in select patients with Stage I breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) in reducing local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in unselected patients with early stage invasive breast cancer has been demonstrated in multiple randomized trials. Whether a subset of women can achieve local control without RT is unknown. In 1986, we initiated a prospective one-arm trial of BCS alone for highly selected breast-cancer patients. This report updates those results. Methods and Materials: Eighty-seven (of 90 planned) patients enrolled from 1986 until closure in 1992, when a predefined stopping boundary was crossed. Patients were required to have a unicentric, T1, pathologic node-negative invasive ductal, mucinous, or tubular carcinoma without an extensive intraductal component or lymphatic-vessel invasion. Surgery included local excision with margins of at least 1 cm or a negative re-excision. No RT or systemic therapy was given. Results: Results are available on 81 patients (median follow-up, 86 months). Nineteen patients (23%) had local recurrence (LR) as a first site of failure (average annual LR: 3.5 per 100 patient-years of follow-up). Other sites of first failure included 1 ipsilateral axilla, 2 contralateral breast cancers, and 4 distant metastases. Six patients developed other (nonbreast) malignancies. Nine patients have died, 4 of metastatic breast cancer and 5 of unrelated causes. Conclusions: Even in this highly selected cohort, a substantial risk of local recurrence occurred after BCS alone with margins of 1.0 cm or more. These results suggest that with the possible exception of elderly women with comorbid conditions, radiation therapy after BCS remains standard treatment.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Lin, C. H.",2015,A four year experience of using moderate deep inspiration breath hold for patients with early-stage breast cancer and dosimetric comparison.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We present our four-year experience of using moderate deep inspiration breath-hold (mDIBH) with an active breathing control (ABC) device for patients with early-stage breast cancer and dosimetric comparison to evaluate the benefit of mDIBH on the heart, lung, and liver. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and having clinical stage Tis, I, or II disease treated between November 2010 and October 2014. Among the 166 patients included in this study, 58 patients were treated with mDIBH and 108 patients were treated with free breathing. Dosimetric analysis was performed to compare dose distribution in the heart, lung, and liver between the two treatment groups. All planning and dosimetric evaluations were performed on the Pinnacle treatment planning system (Phillips Healthcare, Andover, MA). The calculated DVH was compared between the non-ABC and ABC groups. The chi-square test was used to compare the distribution of stage and tumor site between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the remaining parameters between the two groups. Analysis was performed using SPSS v.19. Results: There was no significant difference in the distribution of stage (p=0.19), tumor site (p=0.63), age (p=0.99), clinical target volume (CTV) V50 (p=0.07) and volume of CTV (p=0.23), heart (p=0.30), and liver (p=0.37) between the non-ABC and ABC groups. For all 166 patients, there was a significantly lower ipsilateral lung V5 (p=0.001), ipsilateral lung V10 (p<0.001), ipsilateral lung V20 (p<0.001), mean ipsilateral lung dose (p<0.001), whole lung V5 (p=0.009), whole lung 10 (p<0.001), whole lung V20 (p<0.001), mean whole lung dose (p<0.001), heart V10 (p=0.005), heart V30 (p=0.004), heart V40 (p=0.010), and mean heart dose (p=0.001) in the ABC group. For 81 patients with a leftsided breast tumor, significantly lower ipsilateral lung V5 (p=0.004), ipsilateral lung V10 (p<0.001), ipsilateral lung V20 (p<0.001), mean ipsilateral lung dose (p<0.001), heart V10 (p<0.001), heart V30 (p<0.001), heart V40 (p<0.001), and mean heart dose (p<0.001) were observed in the ABC group. For 85 patients with a right-sided breast tumor, significantly lower ipsilateral lung V10 (p=0.002), ipsilateral lung V20 (p<0.001), mean ipsilateral lung dose (p<0.001), heart V10 (p=0.006), heart V30 (p=0.008), mean heart dose (p<0.001), liver V30 (p<0.001), and mean liver dose (p<0.001) were observed in the ABC group. Conclusion: For early-stage breast cancer patients, mDIBH reduces not only the heart dose but also the lung and liver doses. Our study showed that mDIBH can significantly reduce the heart and lung dose for all breast cancer patients and also reduce the liver dose for right-sided breast cancer patients. The routine integration of mDIBH using an ABC device may decrease radiation-induced toxicity in the heart, lung, and liver."
"Lin, L. L., et al.",2013,Proton beam versus photon beam dose to the heart and left anterior descending artery for left-sided breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Dose to the whole organ heart structure has been shown to be reduced for left-sided breast radiation by techniques including photon IMRT, deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH), and proton beam irradiation. However, dose to the whole heart may not correlate well with dose to the critical structure for late eventseparticularly coronary events involving the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Our purpose was to compare the dose to heart, LAD, and lung between tangential proton and photon beam irradiation for left-sided early stage breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Five women with early stage left-sided breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation. Each gave permission to participate on an IRB-approved prospective study of DIBH and proton beam radiation planning. Whole breast radiation was delivered via a tangential technique utilizing DIBH, inverse planning and sliding window IMRT. The DIBH scan was used for this protocol in order to eliminate the potential effects of motion on the dose distributions. Each patient was replanned using tangential proton beam radiation. The heart and LAD were contoured by a single radiologist/radiation oncologist (SV). Prescription dose to the whole breast was 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with breast clinical target volume coverage of 95% >95%. Results: The coverage of the breast clinical target volumes was comparable between photon and proton plans. The heart V20 was lower with protons vs photons 0.1% (0-3.2) v 0.6% (0-1.8). Additionally, there was a lower dose to 0.2 cc of LAD with protons vs photons median 4.7 (0-28) Gy vs 30 (0-46) Gy as well as a lower minimum and maximum doses to LAD with protons vs photons 0 vs 2.2% and 27.4% vs 66.6%, respectively. Lung dose was comparable between modalities. Lung V20 median was 12.9% (9.2-15.0) vs 10.4% (4.7-17%) for photons vs protons, respectively. Conclusions: The dose to whole heart was relatively low in this study of patients treated under conditions of DIBH. However, proton beam radiation was associated with lower minimum, maximum, and dose to 0.2 cc of the LAD which is the critical structure for late RT effects. Due to the variations in the magnitude of benefit within each patient, comparative planning may be needed for each patient prior to treatment to determine the benefit of protons. Further study in a larger group of patients will be performed."
"Lischalk, J. W., et al.",2015,Definitive radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer: Dosimetric feasibility of stereotactic ablative radiosurgery (SABR) for intact breast tumors.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Few treatment options exist for early-stage breast cancer patients that are medically inoperable. Local control with primary endocrine therapy alone is poor. Moreover, the use of conventionally fractionated definitive radiation therapy is limited by dose limiting toxicity. We examined the feasibility of using SABR for early-stage breast cancer in high-risk surgical candidates. Materials/Methods: Three patients with biopsy proven invasive breast cancer were identified who underwent chest CT imaging prior to surgery. CT findings were correlated with other breast imaging to create a GTV. Inverse robotic radiosurgery system plans were generated to deliver 40 Gy in 5 fractions to a 5mm uniform expansion around the GTV. A dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions was simultaneously delivered to a 1cm expansion around the GTV to account for microscopic disease extension. Organs at risk (OAR) were contoured and 5 fraction dose volume criteria were specified as per NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 and TG-101. Treatment plan delivery was assessed by using a phantom and reproducibility was confirmed. Breast fibrosis complication probability was estimated using a generalized Lyman model. Results: OAR and PTV dose criteria were achieved for all plans. The mean PTV40Gy and PTV30Gy volumes were 3.18 cm3 and 11.73 cm3, respectively. The mean prescription isodose was 87% with a mean treatment time of 44 minutes. The volumes of PTV40Gy and PTV30Gy receiving the prescription dose were 100% and 98%, respectively. The ipsilateral breast V40Gy and V20Gy were 0.97% and 4.13%, respectively. The ipsilateral lung V12Gy was 0.08% and the contralateral lung V2Gy was 0%. The maximum chest wall dose was 32 Gy and only 0.13 cm3 received more than 30 Gy. The maximum skin dose was 25 Gy. The mean heart dose was 0.25 Gy and the heart V2Gy was 0.13%. The contralateral breast and thyroid gland received a maximum dose of 0.12Gy and 0.2Gy, respectively. Estimation of grade 2 or greater late breast fibrosis was 0.026% ± 0.006% using a generalized Lyman model. Conclusion: Stereotactic ablative radiosurgery appears dosimetrically feasible for early stage breast cancer with significant normal tissue sparing and low predicted rates of moderate to severe breast fibrosis. Clinical trials are necessary to explore the safety and efficacy of definitive stereotactic ablative radiation therapy in the management of early stage breast cancer."
"Livi, L., et al.",2010,Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation With IMRT: New Technical Approach and Interim Analysis of Acute Toxicity in a Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate with a randomized clinical trial the possibility of treating the index quadrant with external intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in a selected group of patients with early-stage breast cancer and to analyze the acute toxicity. Methods and Materials: From September 2005, a randomized Phase III clinical trial has been conducted to compare conventional (tangential field) fractionated whole breast treatment (Arm A) with accelerated partial breast irradiation plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (Arm B). For intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the clinical target volume was drawn with a uniform 1-cm margin around the surgical clips in three dimensions. The ipsilateral and contralateral breast, ipsilateral and contralateral lung, heart, and spinal cord were contoured as organs at risk. All the regions of interest were contoured according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements reports 50 and 62 recommendations. Results: In September 2008, 259 patients were randomized and treated. The mean clinical target volume in Arm B was 44 cm3 and the mean planning target volume was 123 cm3. The mean value of the ratio between the planning target volume and the ipsilateral breast volume was 21%. The rate of Grade 1 and Grade 2 acute skin toxicity was 22% and 19% in Arm A (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale), respectively. The tolerance in Arm B was excellent with only 5% Grade 1 and 0.8% Grade 2 acute skin toxicity. The planning constraints were fully satisfied in most patients. In a very few cases, this was not possible because of very unfavorable anatomy. Quality assurance procedures were performed according to our internal quality assurance protocol, with excellent results. Conclusion: In the present preliminary analysis, we have demonstrated that accelerated partial breast irradiation is feasible, with very low acute toxicity.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Livi, L., et al.",2008,"Concurrent Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and 5-Fluorouracil Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy for Early Breast Carcinoma.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The optimal sequencing of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with early-stage breast cancer remains unclear. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively compared 485 patients treated with conservative breast surgery and postoperative whole-breast RT and six courses of CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2) with 300 patients who received postoperative CMF only and with 509 patients treated with postoperative whole-breast RT only. The mean radiation dose delivered was 50 Gy (range, 46-52 Gy) with standard fractionation. The boost dose was 6-16 Gy according to resection margins and at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. Acute and late RT toxicity were scored using respectively the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Late Effects in Normal Tissues Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale. Results: A slightly higher Grade 2 acute skin toxicity was recorded in the concurrent group (21.2% vs. 11.2% of the RT only group, p < 0.0001). RT was interrupted more frequently in the CMF/RT group respective to the RT group (8.5% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.006). There was no difference in late toxicity between the two groups. All patients in the concurrent group successfully received the planned dose of RT and CT. Local recurrence rate was 7.6% in CT/RT group and 9.8% in RT group; this difference was not statistically significant at univariate analysis (log-rank test p = 0.98). However, at multivariate analysis adjusted also for pathological tumor, pathological nodes, and age, the CT/RT group showed a statistically lower rate of local recurrence (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Whole-breast RT and concurrent CMF are a safe adjuvant treatment in terms of toxicity.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Lövey, K., et al.",2007,Fat Necrosis After Partial-Breast Irradiation With Brachytherapy or Electron Irradiation Versus Standard Whole-Breast Radiotherapy-4-Year Results of a Randomized Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To examine the incidence and clinical relevance of fat necrosis after accelerated partial-breast irradiation (PBI) using interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in comparison with partial-breast electron irradiation (ELE) and whole-breast irradiation (WBI). Methods and Materials: Between 1998 and 2004, 258 early-stage breast cancer patients were randomized to receive 50 Gy WBI (n = 130) or PBI (n = 128). The latter consisted of either 7 × 5.2 Gy HDR-BT (n = 88) or 50 Gy ELE (n = 40). The incidence of fat necrosis, its impact on cosmetic outcome, accompanying radiologic features, and clinical symptoms were evaluated. Results: The 4-year actuarial rate of fat necrosis was 31.1% for all patients, and 31.9%, 36.5%, and 17.7% after WBI, HDR-BT and ELE, respectively (pWBI/HDR-BT = 0.26; pWBI/ELE = 0.11; pELE/HDR-BT = 0.025). The respective rate of asymptomatic fat necrosis was 20.2%, 25.3%, and 10% of patients. The incidence of symptomatic fat necrosis was not significantly different after WBI (8.5%), HDR-BT (11.4%), and ELE (7.5%). Symptomatic fat necrosis was significantly associated with a worse cosmetic outcome, whereas asymptomatic fat necrosis was not. Fat necrosis was detectable with mammography and/or ultrasound in each case. Additional imaging examinations were required in 21% of cases and aspiration cytology in 42%. Conclusions: Asymptomatic fat necrosis is a common adverse event of breast-conserving therapy, having no significant clinical relevance in the majority of the cases. The incidence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic fat necrosis is similar after conventional WBI and accelerated partial-breast HDR-BT.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Luo, J., et al.",2016,Acute toxicity effect of hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy with simultaneous boost of the tumor bed in patients with breast-conserving treatment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): It has been well established the long-term safety and efficacy of hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (H-WBI) in randomized trials, but little is known about the acute toxic effects experienced by patients treated with H-WBI and simultaneous boost of the tumor bed (TB).We herein assess the acute toxicity in patients treated with H-WBI and simultaneous boost of the TB after breast conserving surgery. (Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02617043) Materials/Methods: From April 2015, 151 patients enrolled on an IRBapproved prospective study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated RT combined with simultaneous boost of TB in patients with breast conserving treatment. All patient received total dose of 40 Gy/15 Fx for whole breast, combined with simultaneous boost of TB, 3.2 Gy/Fx, total dose of 48 Gy/15 Fx. Simple intensity-modulated radiotherapy (sIMRT) treatment planning were applied in the whole set of patients. The acute toxicity effects were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0. Results: From April 2015 to December 2015, 151 patients with T1-2N0M0 tumors were consecutively and prospectively enrolled into study. The median age was 45 years old (range, 25-70 years). One hundred eleven (73.5%) patients had T1 tumors and 40 (26.5%) patients had T2. Among them, 88 (58.3%) patients received chemotherapy, including anthracycline, paclitaxel and platinum. One hundred thirteen (74.8%) patients were hormone receptor positive and 109 (72.2%) patients received adjuvant hormone therapy. When the acute toxicity effects of radiotherapy were assessed, 8 (5.3%) of them had no obvious acute physician-assessed skin reaction. 120 (79.5%) and 23 (15.2%) patients had Grade 1 and Grade 2 radiation dermatitis, respectively. Most of them showed skin erythema or day desquamation. Nine patients had moist desquamation mainly in the nipple and areola area, and twenty-one patients had mild lymphedema of breast. No grade 3 radiation dermatitis or pneumonitis was observed during treatment. The median treatment time of radiotherapy was 20 days (range, 17-25 days). Conclusion: Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation combined with simultaneous boost of the tumor bed can be well tolerated in patients with early breast cancer, in terms of dermatitis, lymphedema, and pneumonitis. Long term follow up of local control need to be identified in the future."
"Ma, L., et al.",2014,Intraoperative radiation therapy prior to lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer: A single institution study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the safety, cosmesis, and clinical efficacy of intra-operative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) delivered prior to lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: From December 2008 to March 2013, 75 breast cancer patients (ages 34 - 66 years) were treated with IOERT during breast conservative surgery. IOERT was delivered using a mobile LINAC. Suitable energy and applicator size were chosen to ensure coverage of the tumor with anterior and posterior margins of 1 cm and lateral margins of 2 cm. Patients with sentinel node metastases or younger than 40 years received 8 Gy as boost followed by a post-operative external beam radiation therapy of 50 Gy in 25 fractions; the others had 15 Gy prescribed to the 90% isodose depth. The dose rate was 10 Gy/min. for all patients. Adjuvant treatment consisted of chemotherapy alone (14 patients), hormonal therapy alone (18 patients), or combined chemotherapy and hormonal therapy (41 patients). Two patients had no adjuvant treatment. The safety, cosmesis, and short-term efficacy were evaluated. Results: Median follow-up was 49 months (range: 19 - 58 months). Two (2.7%) patients developed post-surgical hematoma. Six (8.0%) patients developed mild breast fibrosis. Eight (10.7%) patients suffered from local pain. One (1.2%) patient experienced a post-operative infection. Sixteen (21.3%) patients developed Grade 1 pulmonary fibrosis. Forty-three (57.3%) patients had an excellent cosmetic result and 23 (30.7%) had a good cosmetic result. Three patients had an ipsilateral breast recurrence, with an actual 3-year local recurrence rate of 4.5%. One patient had an ipsilateral axillary recurrence, resulting in a 3-year regional recurrence rate of 1.4%. No distant metastasis or death was observed. The 3-year disease free survival rate was 94.2%. Conclusions: IORT delivered prior to lumpectomy is safe and feasible for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. Early side effects, cosmesis and short-term efficacy are acceptable, but a longer follow-up is needed for evaluation of late side effects and long-term efficacy."
"MacDonald, S. M., et al.",2013,Proton therapy for breast cancer after mastectomy: Early outcomes of a prospective clinical trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Proton radiation is a form of particle radiation that allows for sparing of tissues distal to the target volume. Comparative planning studies for breast cancer patients suggest potential benefits for protons over standard radiation by improving target volume coverage and cardiopulmonary sparing. The entrance dose is higher for proton radiation, leading to some concern regarding skin tolerance. We report early outcomes in 12 women treated with postmastectomy proton radiation therapy on a prospective clinical trial.Purpose: Dosimetric planning studies have described potential benefits for the use of proton radiation therapy (RT) for locally advanced breast cancer. We report acute toxicities and feasibility of proton delivery for 12 women treated with postmastectomy proton radiation with or without reconstruction. Methods and Materials: Twelve patients were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical trial. The patients were assessed for skin toxicity, fatigue, and radiation pneumonitis during treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks after thecompletion of therapy. All patients consented to have photographs taken for documentation of skin toxicity. Results: Eleven of 12 patients had left-sided breast cancer. One patient was treated for rightsided breast cancer with bilateral implants. Five women had permanent implants at the time of RT, and 7 did not have immediate reconstruction. All patients completed proton RT to a dose of 50.4 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) to the chest wall and 45 to 50.4 Gy (RBE) to the regional lymphatics. No photon or electron component was used. The maximum skin toxicity during radiation was grade 2, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The maximum CTCAE fatigue was grade 3. There have been no cases of RT pneumonitis to date. Conclusions: Proton RT for postmastectomy RT is feasible and well tolerated. This treatment may be warranted for selected patients with unfavorable cardiac anatomy, immediate reconstruction, or both that otherwise limits optimal RT delivery using standard methods.  Inc."
"Madden, N. A., et al.",2016,Five-year outcomes of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) from a large community-based practice.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): APBI is an increasingly utilized option for early stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conservation. In 2009, ASTRO published consensus guidelines on APBI to assist in patient selection. Most outcomes data is from academic centers or clinical trials with littlefrom community based practices. We present survival and toxicity results from a large community based cancer center database of patients with DCIS and invasive breast cancers. Materials/Methods: Three hundred fifty-three consecutive patients (264 invasive, including 10 lobular carcinomas, 89 DCIS) underwent APBI at a single institution from 8/1/2006-12/15/2014, with a median follow up of 5.3 years (range 0.1-9.3 years). Seventy percent of patients (247) were treated in the first 5 years (2006-2010). A database was created with patient, tumor and treatment characteristics. Analysis with Cox regression hazards model was used to evaluate for correlation between patient and tumor factors and overall (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). Results: Median age was 63 (range 39-89). 98.6% of patients were white. Three different catheters were used (255 BCHDRB, 81 Contura, and 16 SAVI). For invasive tumors, 91.6% were T1 and 8.4% T2 (mean tumor size 0.97 cm). The majority of patients (90%) were ER and/or PR positive. 9.1% of patients had LVSI. By ASTRO criteria, 37.8% of patients were suitable, 51.3% cautionary, and 10.9% unsuitable. The ipsilateral recurrence rate was 3.6% (13 recurrences: 9 invasive, 4 DCIS); 9 were ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR), 4 in the treatment field and 5 elsewhere in the breast. There were no recurrences amongst the 10 patients with invasive lobular tumors. 47 patients (13.3%) developed fat necrosis. The rate of fat necrosis decreased from 15.8% during the first 5 years to 7.5% thereafter. 15 patients had surgery due to fat necrosis (6 mastectomies, 6 lumpectomies, 3 incisional biopsies). 32 patients overall (9.1%) had subsequent breast surgery, including a mastectomy rate of 3.4%. Nine mastectomies were due to IBTR (2.5%). 16 deaths occurred, 2 deaths due to breast cancer. 5 year OS and DFS were 93.6% (95% CI 94.1-98.5%) and 96.1% (95% CI 93.9-98.4%). ER/PR negative status (HR 4.6, P = 0.02) and tumor size for invasive tumors (HR 4.47, P = 0.0007) correlated with disease recurrence. Age (HR 0.95, P = 0.08), high grade invasive tumors (HR 6.98, P = 0.065), and LVSI (HR 3.3, P = 0.07) trended towards significance. Only age (HR 1.06, P = 0.01) correlated with overall survival. There was no difference between invasive tumors and DCIS in recurrence or survival. ASTRO suitability group did not correlate with recurrence (unsuitable HR 1.41, P = 0.66) or survival (HR 0.46, P = 0.454). Conclusion: Outcomes for early stage breast cancer patients treated with APBI were excellent in this single institution review. Toxicity was limited including a low mastectomy rate. APBI can be utilized in the community setting and outside of clinical trials without compromising outcomes. ASTRO suitability group did not correlate with recurrence or overall survival."
"Mahalingam, S. B., et al.",2012,Accelerated partial breast irradiation using single lumen balloon catheter for early breast cancer: A community hospital experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) Therapy for women with early stage breast cancer using the single lumen balloon catheter was offered as an option since September 2002. Our goal in this review was to establish the effectiveness of this treatment as an alternative to whole breast irradiation. Materials/Methods: One hundred ninety-nine women with early breast cancer were treated with APBI using the single lumen balloon catheter from September 2002 to December 2009. Patients who met the published eligibility criteria for APBI from the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) and the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) were offered the option of APBI. We reviewed age, stage, hormone receptor status, in breast recurrence, as well as both acute and late complications related to the procedure and treatment. Results: One hundred forty-seven patients had invasive carcinoma and 52 patients had ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Of patients with invasive cancer, 93.4% were stage I and 6% were stage II with positive lymph nodes (N1mi and N1a). A total of 75.3% of the patients were ER/PR positive and 6.1% of the patients were classified as triple negative (ER/PR/ Her2 Née negative). A total of 13.1% of patients were 50 years or younger; 25.8% were between the ages of 51-59 and 61.1% were over 60 years or older. With a median follow-up of 50 months, we observed in breast tumor recurrences (IBTR) in 10 patients (5.0%); one patient (0.5%) had isolated axillary failure. All in breast tumor recurrences were elsewhere failures. Risk factor analysis for in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) showed age and lymph node involvement were not significant predictors. However, univariate analysis showed statistical significance for receptor status, specifically for ER negative (p < 0.01) and for triple negatives (p < 0.01) as predictors of IBTR. Overall survival rate was 96.5% and diseasespecific survival rate was 99%. Procedural complications, such as balloon rupture and balloon asymmetry were observed in 1% and 2.5% of the patients respectively. Surgical wound infection, cellulitis, and local abscesses occurred in 11.1% of patients following completion of brachytherapy; all were treated successfully with antibiotics as well as surgical drainage when indicated. Persistent seroma was observed in 55.3% of patients; of these 75% were asymptomatic. Excellent-good cosmesis was observed in 80.4% of patients. Conclusion: Our experience in a large group of patients treated in the community setting demonstrated that the APBI single lumen balloon catheter is an effective treatment for early breast cancer with 95% local control rate in the breast . The complications were acceptable and comparable to values in the pertinent literature."
"Mahmood, U., et al.",2011,Equivalent survival with breast conservation therapy or mastectomy in the management of youngwomen with early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Young women with breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT) experience higher local recurrence rates compared to older women. Whether such women are better treated with mastectomy is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate survival outcomes of young women with early stage breast cancer treated with BCT or mastectomy using a large, population-based database. Materials/Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, data was obtained for all female patients age 20 to 39 years old diagnosed with T1-2 N0-1 M0 breast cancer between 1990 and 2007 who underwent either BCT (lumpectomy and radiation treatment) or mastectomy. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS). Matched pair analysis of BCTand mastectomy patients was performed with the resulting groups compared via Kaplan-Meier analysis for OS and CSS using the logrank test. Results: A total of 14,760 women were identified of which 45% received BCTand 55% received mastectomy. Median follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 0.5 to 17.9 years). A total of 8318 (56%), 3386 (23%), and 1019 patients (7%) had follow-up at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Multivariable analysis found that year of diagnosis, age, race/ethnicity, grade, progesterone receptor status, tumor size, number of positive lymph nodes, and number of lymph nodes examined were independent predictors of OS and CSS while estrogen receptor status was of borderline significance. After accounting for all patient and tumor characteristics, BCT resulted in similar OS (HR, 0.93; CI, 0.83 - 1.04; p = 0.16) and CSS (HR, 0.93; CI, 0.83 - 1.05; p = 0.26) as compared to mastectomy. Matched pair analysis, including 4644 BCT and mastectomy patients, confirmed no difference in OS or CSS: the 5/10/ 15-year OS for BCT and mastectomy were 92.5%/83.5%/77.0% and 91.9%/83.6%/79.1%, respectively, (p = 0.99) and the 5/10/ 15-year CSS for BCT and mastectomy were 93.3%/85.5%/79.9% and 92.5%/85.5%/81.9%, respectively (p = 0.88). Conclusions: Young women with early stage breast cancer have equivalent outcomes whether treated with BCT or mastectomy. These patients should be counseled appropriately regarding the equivalence of these two treatment strategies, and should not choose a mastectomy based on the assumption of improved survival. Further study of this unique patient population is warranted."
"Mahmood, U., et al.",2012,Similar survival with breast conservation therapy or mastectomy in the management of young women with early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate survival outcomes of young women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT) or mastectomy, using a large, population-based database. Methods and Materials: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, information was obtained for all female patients, ages 20 to 39 years old, diagnosed with T1-2 N0-1 M0 breast cancer between 1990 and 2007, who underwent either BCT (lumpectomy and radiation treatment) or mastectomy. Multivariable and matched pair analyses were performed to compare overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) of patients undergoing BCT and mastectomy. Results: A total of 14,764 women were identified, of whom 45% received BCT and 55% received mastectomy. Median follow-up was 5.7 years (range, 0.5-17.9 years). After we accounted for all patient and tumor characteristics, multivariable analysis found that BCT resulted in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.04; p = 0.16) and CSS (HR, 0.93; CI, 0.83-1.05; p = 0.26) similar to that of mastectomy. Matched pair analysis, including 4,644 BCT and mastectomy patients, confirmed no difference in OS or CSS: the 5-, 10-, and15-year OS rates for BCT and mastectomy were 92.5%, 83.5%, and 77.0% and 91.9%, 83.6%, and 79.1%, respectively (p = 0.99), and the 5-, 10-, and 15-year CSS rates for BCT and mastectomy were 93.3%, 85.5%, and 79.9% and 92.5%, 85.5%, and 81.9%, respectively (p = 0.88). Conclusions: Our analysis of this population-based database suggests that young women with early-stage breast cancer have similar survival rates whether treated with BCT or mastectomy. These patients should be counseled appropriately regarding their treatment options and should not choose a mastectomy based on the assumption of improved survival.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Maluta, S., et al.",2012,Accelerated partial breast irradiation using only intraoperative electron radiation therapy in early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: We report the results of a single-institution, phase II trial of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using a single dose of intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) in patients with low-risk early stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A cohort of 226 patients with low-risk, early stage breast cancer were treated with local excision and axillary management (sentinel node biopsy with or without axillary node dissection). After the surgeon temporarily reapproximated the excision cavity, a dose of 21 Gy using IOERT was delivered to the tumor bed, with a margin of 2 cm laterally. Results: With a mean follow-up of 46 months (range, 28-63 months), only 1 case of local recurrence was reported. The observed toxicity was considered acceptable. Conclusions: APBI using a single dose of IOERT can be delivered safely in women with early, low-risk breast cancer in carefully selected patients. A longer follow-up is needed to ascertain its efficacy compared to that of the current standard treatment of whole-breast irradiation.  Inc."
"Manning, M. A., et al.",2000,Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost: The feasibility and cosmetic outcome of a fractionated outpatient delivery scheme.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility, potential toxicity, and cosmetic outcome of fractionated interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost for the management of patients with breast cancer at increased risk for local recurrence.Methods and Materials: From 1994 to 1996, 18 women with early stage breast cancer underwent conventionally fractionated whole breast radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy) followed by interstitial HDR brachytherapy boost. All were considered to be at high risk for local failure. Seventeen had pathologically confirmed final surgical margins of less than 2 mm or focally positive. Brachytherapy catheter placement and treatment delivery were conducted on an outpatient basis. Preplanning was used to determine optimal catheter positions to enhance dose homogeneity of dose delivery. The total HDR boost dose was 15 Gy delivered in 6 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 days. Local control, survival, late toxicities (LENT-SOMA), and cosmetic outcome were recorded in follow-up. In addition, factors potentially influencing cosmesis were analyzed by logistic regression analysis.Results: The minimum follow-up is 40 months with a median 50 months. Sixteen patients were alive without disease at last follow-up. There have been no in-breast failures observed. One patient died with brain metastases, and another died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease. Grade 1-2 late toxicities included 39% with hyperpigmentation, 56% with detectable fibrosis, 28% with occasional discomfort, and 11% with visible telangiectasias. Grade 3 toxicity was reported in one patient as persistent discomfort. Sixty-seven percent of patients were considered to have experienced good/excellent cosmetic outcomes. Factors with a direct relationship to adverse cosmetic outcome were extent of surgical defect (p = 0.00001), primary excision volume (p = 0.017), and total excision volume (p = 0.015).Conclusions: For high risk patients who may benefit from increased doses, interstitial HDR brachytherapy provides a convenient outpatient method for boosting the lumpectomy cavity following conventional whole breast irradiation without overdosing normal tissues. The fractionation scheme of 15 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 days is well tolerated. The volume of tissue removed from the breast at lumpectomy appears to dominate cosmetic outcome in this group of patients. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc."
"Manzerova, J., et al.",2017,Locoregional management of clinically node-negative male breast cancer: An analysis of a clinical oncology database.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Male breast cancer (BC) is a rare malignancy with a lifetime risk of one in one thousand. Even for early-stage disease, mastectomy (ME) has traditionally been the treatment of choice. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) as part of a breast-conserving therapy (BCT) paradigm is an important consideration with a potential of being equally oncologically effective yet less morbid with better functional and more desirable cosmetic outcomes. Since treatment strategies for male BC are extrapolated from the high-level data on female BC, adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) is a mandatory component of BCT. We sought to investigate the patterns of utilization of ME, BCS, and aRT in a large retrospective cohort of patients. Purpose/Objective(s): The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for men who received definitive treatment for clinically staged T1-3N0 BC from 2004 to 2013. Patients were excluded if pathologic, receptor subtype or treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, radiotherapy) data were missing. Chi-square tests and independent two sample t-tests were used to examine the factors associated with receiving ME vs. BCS, and aRT vs. not. Results: We identified 4280 men meeting inclusion criteria with 73% undergoing ME and 27% undergoing BCS. Among all patients, 84% were hormone receptor-positive and Her2-negative, 5% were triple positive, 3% were triple negative, and 8% had borderline or not fully known receptor status. Among all patients, 77 % were white, 10%-black, and 13% represented other races. The following factors were associated with patients undergoing ME compared to BCS: treatment at an academic rather than non-research center, older age, higher CDCI, higher tumor grade and higher clinical T stage (all P <.001). Among the cohort, 76% of the BCS and 17% of the ME groups received aRT. Undergoing BCS, younger age, lower CDCI, presence of positive lymph nodes, and unfavorable receptor subtype were positively associated with receipt of aRT (all P <.001). Conclusion: In this large observational cohort of males with early breast cancer, most were hormone receptor-positive and Her2-negative, and three quarters received ME. A total of 24% of patients who underwent BCS did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Further insight into the rationale behind the utilization of different forms of treatment and their impact on outcomes is required."
"Marietta, M., et al.",2016,Effect of breast volume on toxicity with hypofractionation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionation remains underutilized, despite long term data from multiple randomized trials showing equivalence of hypofractionation to conventional fractionation for early stage breast cancer. Conventional wisdom was to decrease dose per fraction to reduce skin reaction in patients with larger breasts. In our clinic, we have been offering hypofractionation routinely in early stage breast cancer for the past three years, even for posterior separation >25 cm.We sought to assess skin toxicity among patients receiving hypofractionation in relationship to breast size. Materials/Methods: We performed an IRB approved retrospective review of early stage breast cancer patients treated at our institution between 2012 and 2015. Data was collected on contoured breast volume, whole breast dose, use of boost, beam energy, skin toxicity, cosmesis, and dosimetric variables such as max point dose. Results: Charts were reviewed for 82 patients treated for early stage breast cancer with whole breast radiation, using 3D conformal tangents and fieldin-field optimization. Median follow-up was 7 months. 61 patients were treated with hypofractionation and 21 patients were treated with conventional radiation therapy. In the overall group of patients, the percent of patients with > grade 2 skin toxicity at end of treatment was significantly higher in patients undergoing conventional fractionation, 80.9% versus 27.9% ( P = 0.01). In a subset of patients with large breasts, defined as a contoured breast volume of greater than 1000 cc, the percent of patients with > grade 2 skin toxicity remained significantly higher in patients undergoing conventional fractionation, 88.9% versus 33.3% ( P = 0.01). For conventionally defined large breast size (posterior separation >25), the percent of patients with > grade 2 skin toxicity was 18.2% for hypofractionation versus 75% for conventional treatment. Fatigue, pain, infection rate, and patient reported cosmesis were not significantly different between the two groups. Mean hotspot was similar for hypofractionation as compared to conventional treatment, 106.4 versus 106.6. The volume of breast receiving 105% of prescription dose was slightly higher in patients receiving hypofractionation, mean 59.9 cc versus 36.8 cc. Conclusion: Use of hypofractionation decreases acute skin toxicity as compared to conventional schedules, even in patients with large breasts, and does not increase infection rate or impair cosmesis."
"Mark, R. J., et al.",2019,Five Day Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) Using Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Stage 0-II Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: Randomized trials in selected early stage breast cancer patients with up to 10 year follow-up have proven that Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) given via High Dose Rate (HDR) implant bid in 5 days is equivalent to whole breast External Radiation Therapy (XRT) given qd in 5–6 weeks in regard to breast tumor local recurrence (LR) [1–2]. However, complications with APBI implant in a Medicare database review have been significant, with 3.95% of women requiring Mastectomy, 16.2% developing infections, and another 16.3% experiencing non-infection complications including rib fractures, fat necrosis, and breast pain [3]. Recently APBI using non-invasive Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) given qd in 5 fractions has been shown in another randomized trial with 5 year follow-up to be equivalent to qd XRT in 6 weeks, with respect to LR [4]. IMRT/SBRT was superior in regard to acute effects, late effects, and cosmesis. Objectives: In the randomized clinical trial of APBI IMRT/SBRT, the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was defined by the injection of individual fiducial markers bordering the surgical cavity. At our institution, we have used the Biozorb fiducial system to localize the CTV for SBRT. We sought to confirm the APBI SBRT/IMRT results with a simpler fiducial system. Methods: Between 2017 and 2018, 45 patients have undergone SBRT targeted to a Biozorb defined CTV with the walls of the surgical cavity sewn to the Biozorb device. Eligible patients were older than age 40, had tumor sizes <3 cm, negative surgical margins, and negative sentinel node dissections. SBRT dose was 30 Gy given in 5 fractions. Dose constraints were as follows: V-30 Gy <105%, Ipsilateral Breast V-15 Gy <50%, Ipsilateral Lung V-10 Gy <20%, Contralateral Lung V-5 Gy <10%, Heart V-3 Gy <20%, Contralateral Breast Dmax <2 Gy and Skin Dmax <27 Gy. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) ranged from 27 to 355 cc with a median of 80 cc. PTV = CTV + 1–2 cm. Results: Follow-up ranged from 1–12 months with a median of 6 months. LR has been 0% (0/45). There were no skin reactions. One patient developed pain around the Biozorb site. This resolved within 2 days on a short course of steroids. Cosmetic results as rated by the Surgeon, Radiation Oncologist, and Nurse, were rated excellent in 100% (45/45) of cases. Conclusions: Non-invasive APBI with SBRT given qd over 5 days targeted to Biozorb has resulted in LR, complications, and cosmetic results which compare favorably to invasive APBI given bid with HDR implant. At last follow-up, there have been no LR, skin reactions, or complications. Cosmesis has been excellent in 100% of patients."

J., et al.",2011,Interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for breast cancer in women<50 years of age compared to . 50 Years of age: Median 6 year follow-up in 283 cases using multi-catheter technique.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) has been the standard of care for breast conservation radiation therapy, for more than 20 years. It is well known that pre-menopausal women have a worse prognosis than post-menopausal women. However, it is also known that mastectomy does not confer a better prognosis than breast conservation in these younger women. Hence, the American College of Radiology does not have an age limit for breast conservation candidacy. Recent data indicates that Interstitial Implant and High Dose Rate (HDR) radiation afterloading compares very favorably to EBRT in early stage breast cancer. There is controversy regarding the use of HDR in patients<50 years of age.We present our data in patients< 50 years of age compared to . 50 years of age. Materials/Methods: Patients with Tis, T1, and T2 tumors measuring<4 cm, negative surgical margins, and 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes were judged to be candidates for Interstitial Implant. Implants were performed under Stereotactic Mammographic guidance with conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Radiation Treatment planning was performed using CT Scanning and the Plato System. Treatment volumes ranged from 25 cm3 to 359 cm3. The breast implant volume received 3400 cGy in 10 fractions prescribed to the Planning Target Volume, given BID over 5 days. Results: Between 2000 and 2010, 283 patients underwent Interstitial HDR Implant. The procedure was well tolerated. No patient required hospital admission.With a median follow-up 72 months (range 6-140 months), local recurrence (LR) occurred in 4.2% (12/283). Cosmetic results were good to excellent in 89.8% (254/283) of the patients. LR occurred in 6.1% (2/33) of patients<50 years of age vs. 4.0% (10/250) in patients . 50 years of age (p = 0.63). There were no infections. Wound healing complications developed in 2.8% (8/283). Three of these patients had received anthracycline based Chemotherapy. All eight patients had large (. 200 cm3) implant volumes, catheter spacing of 1.5 cm, and V-150% of . 30%. Two patients healed after 6 months of conservative treatment. Surgery was required in six patients who developed fat necrosis. Conclusions:With median 72 month follow-up, Breast Conservation radiation therapy utilizing Interstitial Multi-Catheter HDR Implant has yielded LR rates and cosmetic results which compare favorably to EBRT in selected patients. There was no statistically significant difference in LR between patients<50 years of age vs. . 50 years of age. While there was a trend towards higher LR in patients<50 years, LR appears comparable to patients treated with EBRT. Therefore, we believe that age<50 years should not be a contraindication for HDR for breast conservation."

Compared to MammoSite and Contura techniques, the Interstitial Multi-Catheter method offers greater flexibility of radiation delivery. Advantages include no concern regarding surgical cavity shape irregularities, balloon conformality to surgical cavity, balloon rupture, balloon movement, air gaps, hematoma, seroma, skin balloon proximity to skin, balloon shape distortion, and catheter movement within the balloon."
"Mashouf, S., et al.",2012,Optimization of permanent seed implant dosimetry incorporating tissue heterogeneity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Permanent seed implant is a brachytherapy technique for adjuvant radiation therapy of early stage prostate and breast cancer patients. In this method low dose rate (LDR) radioactive seeds are permanently implanted across the treatment volume to deliver a prescribed amount of dose. The current standard for calculation of dose surrounding the brachytherapy seeds is based on the recommendations of American Association of Physicist in Medicine Task Group No. 43 (i.e., TG43 formalism) which generates the dose in homogeneous water medium. For low energy sources, however, the dose is highly dependent on the atomic composition of the irradiated volume. In the case of breast, large dose calculation errors was found using the TG43 formalism. Our work focuses on the development of an efficient dose calculation algorithm accounting for tissue heterogeneities in the medium. Materials/Methods: We used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate dose distributions in a heterogeneous model of breast. The radial dose distribution away from a single 103Pd seeds in heterogeneous media was compared with that in homogenous water medium to evaluate the error generated by the TG43 formalism. The Monte Carlo results were also compared with a novel analytical dose calculation algorithm in heterogeneous media. The analytical dose calculation method is based on the physics of interaction of radiation with matter and accounts for variation in density as well as the tissue composition. Results: An increase of up to 40% was noticed to the dose to skin in a heterogeneous model of breast. This is mainly due to the high fat content of breast. The results of our analytical dose calculation algorithm compared very well with Monte Carlo simulations in heterogeneous model of breast as well as cases of extreme heterogeneity variations. Conclusions: By introducing heterogeneity corrections, dose to the skin and other critical organs are estimated more accurately which can potentially lead to lower incidence of toxicities. We have developed a new analytical dose calculation method which enables personalized dose calculations in heterogeneous media. The methodology offers several advantages including fast calculation time enabling easy integration into a clinical setting."
"Mast, M. E., et al.",2012,Preradiotherapy calcium scores of the coronary arteries in a cohort of women with early-stage breast cancer: A comparison with a cohort of healthy women.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Breast cancer radiotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity. However, no data are available on the probability of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) in breast cancer patients when compared with healthy women. Therefore, baseline coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, as an accepted tool to predict CAD, were determined and compared with the CAC scores of a healthy, asymptomatic cohort, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Methods and Materials: Eighty consecutive patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or infiltrative breast cancer referred for radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery were included in our study. Their cardiovascular risk profile was registered, and a 64 multislice CT scan was performed. The CAC scores of an unselected (Caucasian only) Radiotherapy Centre West (RCWEST) cohort, as well as of those of a selected (comorbidity and race adjusted) RCWEST cohort, were determined. The scores of both cohorts were compared with those of the female (Caucasian only) MESA cohort. Results: For the unselected RCWEST cohort (n = 62) we found significant (p <.01) higher scores for women in the 55-64 age category compared with those of the MESA cohort. In the selected cohort (n = 55) the CAC scores of the women in the age category 55-64 were significantly (p =.02) higher compared with the MESA cohort. No significant differences were noted in the other age categories. Conclusion: Both cohorts revealed that CAC scores in the 55-64 age category were significantly higher than the CAC scores in the asymptomatic (female) MESA population. These data suggest that breast cancer patients bear a higher risk of developing coronary heart disease before the start of radiotherapy. Therefore, measures to decrease cardiac dose further in breast cancer radiotherapy are even more important.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Matsubara, H., et al.",2017,Is scanning irradiation method always better? a case of carbon-ion radiation therapy on breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Carbon-ion therapy provides good physical dose distribution thanks to a Bragg peak. Charged particles therapy has two kinds of irradiation methods: passive and scanning irradiation. Because three-dimensional irradiation realizes flexible dose distribution, scanning method is supposed usually to provide better dose distribution than passive one. Aiming good cosmetic outcome, clinical trial of carbon-ion therapy on early breast cancer without surgery on breast has been started at the NIRS in Japan. The present study is aimed to discuss which irradiation method is more suitable for the carbon-ion treatment on early breast cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Eleven Japanese patients who received carbon-ion therapy on early breast cancer using passive irradiation method were retrospectively analyzed. A prescription dose was 48-60 Gy(RBE)/4 fr. Treatment plans with passive irradiation were taken from the original plans, while those with scanning one were newly calculated, where XiO-N and XiO-N2 were employed, respectively. Active-energy scanning was taken for calculation of scanning method. The treatment plans were created so that skin dose did not reach half of the prescribe dose for safety. Only skin was selected as an OAR because of good dose localization of carbon-ion. Dose delivered to 95% of planning target volume and degree of skin dose were derived from each dose-volume histogram and were compared for discussion. Results: High dose concentration on target was randomly seen in treatment plans by passive or scanning irradiation depending on patient. Similar results were also seen in skin dose. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with two-sided was applied in order simply to discuss the superiority of the irradiation method. The p values suggested that there was no significant difference in superiority between the passive and the scanning irradiation methods. Conclusion: The present study suggests that the scanning irradiation method is not always superior to the passive one although several studies have reported superiority of scanning irradiation. The unexpected result is supposed to be owing to peculiarity of breast cancer such as simplicity of OAR and shallow depth point of target from skin. Shallowness in terms of target point requires low incident energy for carbon-ion. That causes large beam spot size and blurring of dose distribution for scanning irradiation but does not change its size for passive irradiation because of usage of a collimator. It is worth noting that the present study suggests that passive irradiation method still provides sophisticated dose distribution depending on case."
"Matuschek, C., et al.",2016,The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery in older patients with low-risk breast cancer: A meta-analysis of randomized trials.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): The answer if older patients with low risk breast cancer and antihormone therapy need adjuvant radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery is still not clear. The data of randomized trials are available. Materials/Methods: A total of 3,766 older patients with early stage breast cancer and tamoxifen were investigated if they still needed additional radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery. Published hazard ratios and hazard ratios extracted from available survival curves for overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were basis of our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the effect sizes on PFS was performed using a random effects model based on parameter estimates of log hazard ratios in Cox models and their standard errors. Furthermore overall survival was examined. Results: Radiation therapy with tamoxifen in older patients and low risk breast cancer did result in an improvement of local relapse (Hazard Ratio: 6.8, 95% confidence limits 4.23-10.93, P = 2.4E-15). There was no significant difference for overall survival. Conclusion: Additional radiation therapy with tamoxifen did improve local relapse in breast cancer patients but not for overall survival."
"McCann, C., et al.",2017,Breast ablation therapy: A novel treatment paradigm for early stage breast cancer patients-preclinical evaluation in an in vivo porcine breast model.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Our team has designed a consolidated treatment approach for early stage breast cancer: Breast Ablation Therapy (BAT). The goal of this paradigm is to treat patients with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using a novel coil device operated at 27.12 MHz, in lieu of lumpectomy, immediately followed by partial breast irradiation (PBI) using High Dose Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for definitive treatment. This approach has several hypothesized advantages including reduction in treatment time-course (standard treatment over 6-8 weeks is now reduced to 2-5 days), costs and resource utilization, and maximized cosmetic outcomes. To ascertain the feasibility and pathologic efficacy of BAT, we have developed a pre-clinical, in vivo porcine model. We hypothesize that thermal ablation followed by HDR multicatheter insertion is safe and feasible. A secondary endpoint includes pathologic efficacy of the thermal ablation. Purpose/Objective(s): Pre-clinical evaluation of the ultrasound (US)-guided BAT procedure (RFA and HDR brachytherapy catheter insertion), was conducted in breast tissue of 3 Yorkshire pigs acquired immediately after weaning to avoid mammary tissue involution. An US-and CT-avid marker, used as a surrogate tumor target, was inserted into each breast of the anesthetized animal. A CT scan was acquired for RFA targeting and planning. The coil was inserted under US-guidance for optimal placement surrounding the target. Treatments were applied to multiple teats in each animal. In each treatment, RFA was delivered for 10 minutes at 125 Watts with the coil (1cm diameter, 3cm length, 7mm pitch), immediately followed by insertion of 16 catheters via a brachytherapy template. Optimal configuration of catheters was selected based on an assumed 2cm diameter tumor. A margin of 0.5cm was added circumferentially to account for microscopic disease, resulting in a 3cm diameter planning target volume (PTV), as per ABS guidelines, PTV=CTV. Breast tissue was resected for gross and microscopic pathologic examination (H&E and NADH). Safety measures, including optimal grounding and topical cooling close to ablation zones, were used. Results: 10 teats from 3 pigs were treated with RFA and catheter insertion. US imaging and post-treatment CT indicated accurate targeting of the coil and catheters. Gross examination of the treated breast tissue showed thermal lesions diameters and lengths ranging from 3-5cm and 3-6cm respectively. Temperatures measured during heating ranged from 65°C-100°C. NADH staining showed complete loss of cell vitality in the treatment volume, consistent with coagulative necrosis. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first described preclinical in vivo porcine model of breast tissue for evaluation of minimally invasive interstitial therapies. Results suggest that breast RFA, with subsequent insertion of brachytherapy catheters, is safe and feasible, and results in reproducible cell death. Future work is concentrated on application of BAT in a first-in-human trial."
"McCormick, B., et al.",2012,Impact of guideline changes in the elderly with early breast cancer (BC): Practice patterns at NCCN institutions.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) is a critical adjunct to breast conservation surgery (BCS) because it enhances both local control and survival of BC. However, a phase III CALGB trial published in 2004 demonstrated that women age 70 or older with estrogen receptor (ER) positive, T1, cN0 cancers derive no survival advantage and only a very limited benefit in local control from radiation when treated with BCS and adjuvant tamoxifen (endocrine therapy [ET]). Treatment with BCS + ET without RT was incorporated as a Category I option in the NCCN Guidelines in 2004 for this subset of women. This study examines factors associated with adoption of this practice across the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) cancer centers. Materials/Methods: The NCCN Breast Outcomes Database was used to identify women 70 and over with T1, cN0, hormone receptor positive breast cancers from 2000-2009 receiving care at 13 participating NCCN cancer centers. Factors considered to be potentially associated with use of RT a priori were evaluated in univariate and multivariable models, including year of diagnosis, tumor size, grade, histology, multicentric/ multifocal disease, Her2neu status, triggering event, patient age, race/ ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), Charlson/Katz co-morbidity score, type of biopsy, use of axillary surgery, and treating institution. Date of diagnosis was classified as 2000-2004 versus 2005-2009, reflecting the date of guideline change. Results: One thousand, five hundred forty-three women met study criteria; overall 1292 women (84%) had BCS. Among these, 1,005 (78%) received adjuvant breast RT; standard whole breast RT technique was used in 98.5%. ET without or with chemotherapy was used in 83% of all women. In a multivariable analysis, diagnosis year prior to 2005 (p = 0.0003), younger age (p < 0.0001), lower co-morbidity score (p = 0.0006), and larger tumor sizes (p = 0.0146) were all significant predictors of use of RT. For example, 94% of women ages 70-74 received RT in 2000, compared with 88% in 2009; for the same time intervals in the 80 or above age group, usage was 80% versus 38%. Women who had axillary surgery as well were significantly more likely to receive RT (p < 0.0001). In addition, treating institution was a statistically significant factor associated with use of RT (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Following the change in the NCCN guideline recommendations for elderly women with Stage I, estrogen receptor positive BC, the use of RT with BCS decreased over time in NCCN centers; however most women still received RT. Patient characteristics such as age and comorbidity impacted the use of RT. In addition, a key factor significantly affecting treatment use of RT was the institution where a woman received her treatment."
"McCormick, B., et al.",1988,Iridium-192 implants for primary breast cancer: Experience with placement at the time of wide local excision.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"An Ir-192 boost is a technique frequently used to deliver an additional dose of radiation therapy to the tumor bed following breast conserving surgery and combined with external beam radiation therapy to the entire breast for patients with early breast cancer. Traditionally these catheters are placed following completion of 4500-5000 cGy, as a separate procedure. This paper described a Pilot Study identifying placement of the catheters at the time of primary wide local excision, or re-excision in 52 patients. The key to the success of this technique is the achievement of complete hemostasis in the primary cavity, the presence of the radiation oncologist during the surgical procedure itself, and closure of the wound prior to placement of the catheters. Details of the technique, and preliminary patient results are presented."
"McCormick, B., et al.",1989,The patient's perception of her breast following radiation and limited surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Seventy-four patients followed from 1 to 8 years post completion of breast-conserving surgery and radiation for early-stage breast cancer were asked to answer a questionnaire exploring their perception and awareness of the treated breast. The questionnaire was divided into several sections, including 'Daily Activities', 'Pre-menstrual Changes', 'Sexual Activities', and a summary 'Satisfaction Index' section; when appropriate, comparisons were sought between the treated and untreated breasts. Preliminary results from this study indicate that 70% of all patients are aware of their treated breast in some way during everyday activities. The 'Satisfaction Index' of this patient group is very high, with 75% rating their cosmetic result, and 81% their functional result '8' or higher on a scale of '0' to '10', '10' indicating 'best' or 'normal'."
"McGee, L. A., et al.",2017,Postmastectomy chest wall reirradiation with proton therapy for breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To assess toxicity outcomes in postmastectomy breast cancer patients receiving chest wall (CW) reirradiation (reRT) with proton therapy (PT). Purpose/Objective(s): From 2012-2016, 22 breast cancer patients received postmastectomy (CW) reRT with PT at a single institution. Patients were included if they had a history of prior thoracic radiotherapy (RT) and had indications for reRT for a primary or recurrent breast cancer diagnosis. 21 patients received treatment to the CW plus comprehensive lymph nodes (LN) and 1 patient received PT to the CW and internal mammary LN only. Indications for inclusion of LN included LN positive disease (N=10), inflammatory breast cancer at time of recurrence (N=2) or lack of pathological assessment of the axilla (N=10). 10 patients had reconstruction prior to initiation of PT reRT. Initial RT characteristics include the following: 40 Gy to a mantle field for Hodgkin Lymphoma (N=1), RT to the intact breast for initial early stage breast cancer diagnosis (N=18), RT to the breast or CW plus the supraclavicular fossa for LN positive disease at initial diagnosis (N=2) and partial breast RT (N=1). Median initial RT dose was 60 Gy (10-70 Gy). Median time interval between courses of RT was 12 years (3-36 years). ReRT was performed with PT using a uniform scanning (N=19) or pencil beam scanning (N=3) technique. Median PT dose was 50.51 (45.1-76.31) GyE. 2 patients had gross disease due to dermal lymphatic progression at PT initiation. Toxicity was assessed prospectively per CTCAE v. 4.0 at baseline, weekly during PT, 2 weeks and 4 weeks following PT and then every 6 months. Cosmesis at last follow-up was retrospectively assessed and graded according to the Harvard/NSABP/RTOG grading scale. Results: Median follow-up was 15 months (3-39 months). At the time of last follow-up, all patients had locoregional control. One patient developed distant metastases 17 months following PT. Acute skin toxicity occurred in all patients; grade 1 (N=5), grade 2 (N=15) and grade 3 (N=2). Acute grade 2 esophagitis occurred in 7 patients. Acute grade 2 CW pain occurred in 10 patients; grade 3 occurred in 1 patient. At the time of last follow-up, 3 patients had experienced rib fracture. Pneumonitis requiring steroid treatment occurred in 1 woman 7 months post-PT. 3 women had grade 2 lymphedema at last follow-up. 3 women experienced delayed wound healing following surgical intervention in the reRT treatment field; one of which was treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Cosmetic outcomes at the time of last follow-up were grade 1 (N=1), grade 2 (N=9) grade 3 (N=11) and grade 4 (N=1). All patients experienced CW fibrosis; grade 1 (N=14), grade 2 (N=6) and grade 3 (N=2). At the time of last follow-up, Grade 1 CW pain was experienced in 13 patients. Conclusion: ReRT with PT in breast cancer patients appears to have acceptable toxicity. Following reRT to the CW surgical intervention in the treatment field should be avoided. Longer follow-up is needed."
"McGuffin, M., et al.",2014,"The cost of convenience: A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing external beam radiation therapy, high-dose-rate brachytherapy, and permanent seed implants for early-stage breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Standard treatment for early stage breast cancer includes the delivery of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the whole breast following breast conserving surgery. In the past decade, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been proposed for well selected patients with early stage breast cancer. Standard brachytherapy generally uses high-dose rate treatment. Our institution pioneered the use of permanent breast seed implants (PBSI). With the explosion in health care spending, cost has become a major limiting factor to new treatment adoption. The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing EBRT to brachytherapy APBI techniques. Materials/Methods: An activity based costing (ABC) method was used to determine the total cost from a societal perspective of each of three treatment regimens for early stage breast cancer at a large cancer center in Canada: a 25 fraction course of EBRT, a 10 fraction course of HDR, and a single PBSI procedure. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to examine estimates made for a range of treatment and patient factors. A Markov model comparing EBRT, HDR and PBSI was developed with a time horizon of 20 years. Utilities, recurrence risks and mortality data were adapted from the literature and governmental databases. Sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in recurrence risks and utilities. Costs, reported in 2013 CAD, and quality-adjusted life years (QUALY) were discounted at 3% per year. Results: Overall, the results of the ABC process indicated a 10 fraction course of HDR to be the most expensive option ($14,400), followed by PBSI ($7,900), with a 25 fraction course of EBRT providing the least expensive option ($3,700). The least costly method to the health care system was EBRT while the least costly method to the patient was PBSI. Both PBSI and HDR were dominated by EBRT under cost-effectiveness analysis, with HDR providing the least cost-effective method overall. These results were maintained under sensitivity analysis for a wide range of assumptions. Conclusions: Overall, EBRT proved to be the most cost-effective method of delivering radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. However, due to the number of treatments involved, PBSI was found to be the least costly method to the patient. As outcomes of EBRT and APBI are similar for patients selected according to the ASTRO consensus statement guidelines, PBSI can be considered an advantageous treatment option for patients seeking a convenient, less costly alternative."
"McGuffin, M., et al.",2014,Breast cancer patient preferences for adjuvant radiation therapy postlumpectomy: Whole-breast irradiation versus partial breast irradiation-preliminary results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The standard regimen of radiation therapy following lumpectomy is whole breast irradiation (WBI) to the entire breast including the lumpectomy cavity and all the surrounding normal breast tissue. Recently, there has been increased interest in partial breast irradiation (PBI) as an alternative to WBI. However, the preferences of patients with early breast cancer as to what type of radiation therapy regimen post lumpectomy they would prefer and why is unclear in the literature. This study was conducted to determine whether patients with early stage breast cancer would prefer PBI or WBI and to identify important factors for patients when making their treatment decision. Materials/Methods: Based on our previous study of early stage breast cancer patient information needs, the relevant literature and the ASTRO consensus statement guidelines, an educational tool and questionnaire were developed. New patients with early breast cancer who were referred for adjuvant radiation therapy at a large cancer center in Canada were invited to participate. Women ≥40 years of age with a new histological diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast carcinoma treated with breast conserving surgery showing clear margins for non-invasive and invasive disease and negative axillary nodes were eligible. Descriptive statistics were used to describe all variables of interest. The proportion of patients preferring WBI or PBI was summarized using 95% confidence intervals. A chi-square analysis was carried out to assess the bivariate relationships between treatment preference in relation to demographic variables as well as Likert scale responses from the questionnaire. A logistic regression model was run to assess the multivariate relationship between potentially important variables (p < 0.2) and treatment preference. Results: Out of 55 patients enrolled in the study, 18 preferred PBI and 37 preferred WBI post lumpectomy. Factors rated as important by patients in making their decision included convenience [PBI = 12(67%), WBI = 23(64%)], financial factors [PBI=8(44%), WBI=16(43%)], radiation dose to the breast [PBI = 13(76%), WBI = 31(84%)], invasiveness [PBI = 11(61%), WBI = 31(89%), p = 0.02], recurrence rate [PBI = 18(100%), WBI = 37(100%)], survival [PBI = 18(100%), WBI = 36(97%)], effectiveness [PBI=17(94%), WBI=37(100%)], standard method of treatment [PBI = 10(56%), WBI = 34(94%), p = 0.001] and radiation dose to surrounding organs [PBI = 15(83%), WBI = 36(97%)]. Conclusions: Our preliminary data shows that patients with early breast cancer prefer WBI as an adjuvant treatment post lumpectomy. Of the items listed in the survey, choosing the standard method of treatment and invasiveness were the only statistically significant factor influencing patient preference in the decision making process. A detailed analysis of all decisional preferences between WBI and PBI will be presented. (Table Presented)."
"McLane, A., et al.",2010,Hypofractionated whole breast radiation plus boost for breast cancer: A retrospective analysis of outcomes and toxicities by age.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The role of a boost after hypofractionated radiation to the whole breast is controversial, particularly in the setting of young patient age and with the use of chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate acute toxicities and local control rates (LCR) in a cohort of patients who received hypofractionated radiation plus boost (HFx+B) at a single academic medical center. Materials/Methods: From an institutional database of 1,528 women treated in our department from 2000 to 2007 with radiation following lumpectomy, 350 women received hypofractionated whole breast radiation. Of these, 177 tumors in 176 women (1 bilateral) with early-stage breast cancer also received a sequential boost to the lumpectomy cavity and are the focus of this study. Patient, disease and treatment information was retrospectively captured, as was the incidence of acute skin and subcutaneous toxicities (defined as RTOG grade 2-4 dermatitis, pruritus or breast edema) recorded during radiation treatment (RT). Patients were stratified by age group: < 50 vs. >50 years old. Differences between groups were examined by Chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate time to local failure. Results: Median follow-up was 36.6 months (range, 24-74) from the end of RT. Median age was 56 years (range, 30-86) with 30% < 50 and 70% >50 years old. The distribution of AJCC stage was 71% Stage 1 and 29% Stage 2. Eighty-one percent were pN0 and 19% were pN1. The majority of patients (98%) received whole breast RT with simplified IMRT. Forty-eight percent received adjuvant chemotherapy and 82% received hormone therapy. Ten percent (17) of patients were Her-2 positive and of these, 8 received trastuzumab during RT. All patients received 42.4 Gy in 16 fractions to the breast, followed by a sequential boost (median dose 10 Gy in 5 fractions) to the lumpectomy cavity, delivered with electrons in 90% and photons in 10%. Whole breast RT was delivered in the prone position in 86% and supine in 14%. Overall, there were 3 local recurrences in the entire cohort (1 in < 50, 2 in >50). Age was not a significant predictor of 3Y-LRC (97.8% < 50, 98.1% >50, p = 0.96). Univariate analysis was not performed due to the paucity of local failures. The incidence of RTOG grade 2-3 toxicities in the entire cohort was 15%, with no difference between the < 50 and >50 groups (p = 0.82). There were no grade 4 and only one incidence of grade 3 toxicity. Conclusions: HFx+B was well tolerated in the acute setting in a cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients that included a significant percentage of young women and those who received chemotherapy. 3-year local control with this regimen was excellent, even in younger women. Analysis of both clinical and cosmetic outcomes with longer follow-up is certainly warranted."
"Meng, J., et al.",2019,Adjuvant Breast Radiotherapy Using a Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Results from a Phase II Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of the study was to report outcome analysis of a prospective institutional phase 2 trial of patients undergoing postoperative whole breast irradiation with inversely intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and a simultaneous integrated boost following breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Materials/Methods: This prospective cohort study (NCT01394575) included 532 patients treated with RT for invasive breast cancer (T1-2, N1-2M0) or carcinoma in situ after BCS. Patients received whole-breast radiation therapy to 45 Gy in 25 weekly fractions with a simultaneous integrated boost to the tumor bed of 60Gy in 25 fractions. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, development of distant metastatic disease, and overall survival. Patients were also evaluated for acute toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0). Results: Between 2010 and 2014, 532 eligible patients (65 DCIS and 467 invasive breast cancer) underwent whole breast irradiation with intensity modulated radiotherapy and simultaneously integrated boost (IMRT-SIB) following BCS. The median age was 46 years old (range, 22-74 years), and the median follow-up period was 5.06 years. The most common grade 1 or 2 acute toxicities were breast pain, radiation dermatitis, and fatigue. There was only one patient presenting a grade 3 event (0.18%). Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence developed in a total of two patients (0.3%), one in conjunction with widespread metastatic disease. Distant metastatic disease developed in eight patients (1.5%), and the five-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 98.1% and 99.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Five-year disease-specific outcomes for adjuvant breast radiotherapy using a simultaneous integrated boost are favorable in early-stage breast cancer."
"Merchant, T. E., et al.",1996,The influence of older age on breast cancer treatment decisions and outcome.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Information concerning the differences between older and younger women with breast cancer, treated with standard therapy, is lacking from many prospective series. The purpose of this study is to identify factors that influence treatment decisions and determine if women age 65 and older are treated differently than younger women. The outcomes of older women would then be compared to younger women to determine if treatment differences influence outcome. Methods and Materials: The records of 558 women with early invasive breast cancer who were treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Four hundred thirty-two women under the age of 65 (range: 24-64) and 126 women age 65 and older (range: 65-85) were assessed for treatment differences including breast reexcision, extent of axillary dissection, extent of breast and nodal irradiation, and the use of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Differences in the treatment of the two groups were determined and the end points of local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were compared. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. Results: The two treatment groups had identical pathologic TNM staging with the exception that 21% of the older age group and 5% of the younger age group did not undergo axillary dissection. Women age 65 and older were less likely to have a reexcision, extensive axillary dissection, chemotherapy, or nodal irradiation. They were more likely to receive hormonal therapy. Reexcision in older women was positively influenced by a family history of breast cancer and negatively influenced by a history of previous malignancy. None of the patients who were treated without an axillary dissection suffered a regional recurrence. Although local control was better in older patients, there were no differences in disease-free or overall survival for the two groups. Discussion: The findings of this study reveal that older patients have significant treatment differences as compared to younger patients; however, despite these differences, similar local control and survival were achieved at 5 and 10 years. With the expected survival of older women increasing, the prospective evaluation of treatment options for older women should be considered."
"Mignot, F., et al.",2019,Disseminated Tumor Cells Predict Efficacy of Regional Nodal Irradiation in Early Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) collect in the bone marrow and indicate micrometastatic spread. We previously reported that DTCs could be a predictive factor for the efficacy of regional node irradiation (internal mammary nodes [IMNs]/supra- and infraclavicular nodes [SCNs]). In this article, we report the long-term results (>10 years) on the impact of DTC status in early stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Patients with localized breast cancer were eligible for inclusion in this prospective cohort. DTCs were obtained from a medullary iliac crest sample performed before any primary therapy. DTC status was prospectively assessed by pathologists. Irradiation volumes were defined per standard of care. Cumulative incidence rates and hazard ratios were obtained using both Cox and Fine-Gray models. Interaction tests were performed to confirm the predictive value of DTC status in a multivariate analysis. Results: Six hundred twenty patients with localized breast cancer were included. Overall, 94 patients (15.2%) were DTC-positive. After a median follow-up of 11.7 years, 47 patients (7.6%) experienced locoregional relapse. DTC detection was associated with a higher risk of locoregional relapse in univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.7; P =.001). In the multivariate subgroup analysis, IMN/SCN irradiation significantly reduced locoregional relapse among DTC-positive patients compared with DTC-negative patients (interaction test: hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.9; P =.02). IMN/SCN was the only irradiation volume with an impact on locoregional relapse in patients according to DTC status, and the predictive value of DTC status for the benefit of locoregional irradiation was independent of locoregional nodal status. Conclusions: This long-term analysis confirms the predictive impact of DTC status on the efficacy of regional radiation therapy for locoregional relapse in early breast cancer. After further studies, DTC status could be used as a decision tool to better tailor adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with early stage breast cancer."
"Milby, A., et al.",2012,Incidence and patterns of distant metastases for patients with early-stage breast cancer after breast conservation treatment: Competing risks analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast conservation treatment (BCT), consisting of breast conservation surgery (BCS) followed by definitive radiation therapy (RT), has been shown to be effective for early-stage breast cancer. (Table Presented) Patterns of metastatic failure by specific anatomic site are not well described in the literature. Materials/Methods: A total of 1754 patients with stage I or II invasive carcinoma of the breast treated with BCT between 1977 and 2003 were identified. Patients were scored based on first site of metastasis: bone, brain, lung, liver, or other. Non-breast cancer deaths, contralateral breast cancer, and secondary malignancies were treated as competing risks events. Cumulative incidence functions for each competing event were calculated using competing risk methodology. Univariate analysis was performed by Fine and Gray's competing risk regressions to determine the subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) associated with the patient and tumor characteristics. Results: The most common event was non-breast cancer death (16.5% at 15 years, 95% CI 13.9 to 19.4%). The most common metastatic site of isolated metastasis was bone (5.9% at 15 years). The table shows the estimated cumulative incidence function (CIF) using competing risk analysis. The four most common anatomic sites of distant metastases as the first isolated event were bone (41.1%), lung (22.4%), liver (7.3%), and brain (7.3%). On univariate analysis, there were multiple patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics that increased the risk of distant metastases at specific sites. Conclusions: The present study has demonstrated the site-specific risks of metastases, and has shown distinct patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics associated with the risk of site-specific metastases. These data support current clinical practice of not screening for site-specific metastatic disease after BCT."
"Milgrom, S., et al.",2011,Characteristics and outcomes of early-stage breast cancer in mastectomy patients with low-volume sentinel node disease and no axillary treatment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Multiple studies have reported low axillary failure rates in patients with limited nodal disease who undergo breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone. The applicability of these findings to mastectomy patients has not been established. Our goals were to evaluate disease control rates in total mastectomy (TM) patients with early node-positive disease treated with SLNB alone and to compare their characteristics to similar patients who underwent BCT. Materials/Methods: Five hundred sixty-eight patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent definitive breast surgery (214 TM, 354 BCS) and SLNB alone from 1997 to 2009 were identified from an institutional database. Of these, the 214 patients who received TM were the focus of this study. Patient and tumor characteristics were compared between TM and BCT groups. Local, regional and distant recurrence rates in the TM cohort were analyzed. Results: The majority of tumors were T1 or T2 (99%), ER-positive (79%), PR-positive (65%), and Her2-negative (80%). Nodal stage was N0(i+) in 53% of cases, N1mic in 37%, and N1a in 10%. The median number of total lymph nodes removed was 3 and of positive lymph nodes was 1. Sixty-eight percent of patients received chemotherapy, and 74% received endocrine therapy. Eleven patients (5%) received postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). Larger tumor size (1.9 cm vs. 1.5 cm, p<0.001), greater nodal burden (18% vs. 9% pN1a, p = 0.0017) and presence of lymphovascular invasion (64% vs. 25%, p<0.0001) were significantly associated with receipt of PMRT. When compared to BCT patients, TM patients were more likely to be <50 years old (p = 0.012) and non-white (p = 0.0004) and to receive chemotherapy (67% vs. 51%, p = 0.001). TM patients more frequently had preoperative breast MRIs (p = 0.0003), larger tumors (median 1.5 cm vs. 1.2 cm, p = 0.002), and higher nomogram scores predicting further axillary nodal involvement (12.7% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.022). With a median follow-up of 47 months, there were 3 local recurrences, 3 regional recurrences and 1 distant recurrence. The 4-year local control, regional control, disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 98.1%, 98.7%, 96.6%, and 97.6%, respectively. Conclusions: In our study, TM patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with SLNB alone had larger tumors and more advanced nodal burden compared to BCT counterparts. Nonetheless, in these selectTMpatients with minimal-volume nodal disease after SLNB alone, 4-year disease control rates were low in the absence of axillary dissection or adjuvant radiotherapy. Further refinement of selection criteria for mastectomy patients who may avoid axillary dissection and radiation is warranted."
"Mislmani, M., et al.",2012,Comparison of different radiation techniques to achieve normal tissue sparing and target volume coverage in the treatment of left-sided early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): As long-term cardiac effects of breast cancer treatment become better defined, it is important to minimize cardiac exposure from radiation.We undertook this study to compare normal tissue exposure (heart, left anterior descending artery (LAD), and lung) and target volume coverage (whole breast and tumor bed) using free breathing (FB) 3-D conformal planning, IMRT, and deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) using the assisted breathing control (ABC) device. A cost effectiveness analysis is also included. Materials/Methods: Following IRB approval, we reviewed 10 consecutive patients who received radiation for left sided breast cancer treated with ABC. Patients were selected for the ABC device if any part of the heart would receive greater than 25 Gy with standard 3-D planning. For these 10 patients we created FB 3-D conformal plans as well as IMRT plans to compare target coverage and normal tissue avoidance. All patients were (Table Presented) planned with a whole breast dose of 46 Gy with a 16 Gy tumor bed boost. Average values were calculated for each parameter. Results: The following numbers (illustrated in the Table) represent the means for each parameter for 3D, IMRT, DIBH respectively: V20 Lt lung: 12.3, 19.5, 12.1%; V10 Lt lung: 17.4, 35.4, 19.1%; mean lung dose: 3.7, 7.8, 3.6 Gy; V25 heart: 2.4, 6.1, 0.2%; mean heart dose: 3.8, 8.6, 2.8 Gy; V25 LAD: 55, 9.84, 1.78%; Mean LAD dose: 33.4, 16.2, 9.2 Gy; Breast volume receiving 95% of Rx: 86.0, 93.4, 85.5%; Tumor bed volume receiving full Rx dose: 96.1, 91.7, 95.8%.The typical sums of technical and professional charges for a course of breast radiation are: $72,593, $117,927 and $73,902 for 3D, IMRT and DIBH, respectively. Conclusions: Radiation therapy for left-sided early stage breast cancer using DIBH and the ABC device achieves similar/superior cardiac and pulmonary sparing while maintaining adequate target coverage. While IMRT provided better global coverage of the whole breast, it was inferior in attaining full dose to the tumor bed whilst sparing the heart. There is a significantly lower cost using DIBH compared to IMRT."
"Monten, C., et al.",2017,Highly Accelerated Irradiation in 5 Fractions (HAI-5): Feasibility in Elderly Women With Early or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To investigate, in a prospective phase 1 to 2 trial, the safety and feasibility of delivering external beam radiation therapy in 5 fractions to the breast or thoracic wall, including boost and/or lymph nodes if needed, to women aged ≥65 years with breast cancer. Methods and Materials Ninety-five patients aged ≥65 years, referred for adjuvant radiation therapy, were treated in 5 fractions over 12 days with a total dose of 28.5 Gy/5.7 Gy to the breast or thoracic wall and, if indicated, 27 Gy/5.4 Gy to the lymph node regions and 32.5 Gy/6.5 Gy to 34.5 Gy/6.9 Gy to the tumor bed. The primary endpoint was clinically relevant dermatitis (grade ≥2). Results Mean follow-up time was 5.6 months, and mean age was 73.6 years. Clinically relevant dermatitis was observed in 11.6% of patients and only occurred in breast irradiation with boost (17.5% grade 2-3 vs 0% in the no-boost group). Although doses were high, treatment delivery with intensity modulated radiation therapy was swift, except for complex treatments, including lymph nodes for which single-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy was needed to reduce beam-on time. Conclusion Accelerated radiation therapy in 5 fractions was technically feasible and resulted in low acute toxicity. Clinically relevant erythema was only observed in patients receiving a boost, but still at an acceptable rate. Although the follow-up is still short, the results on acute toxicity after accelerated radiation therapy were encouraging. A 5-fraction schedule is well tolerated in the elderly and may lower the threshold for radiation therapy in this population."
"Moran, M. S., et al.",2011,Evaluation of vascular endothelial growth factor as a prognostic marker for local relapse in early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important protein involved in the process of angiogenesis that has been found to correlate with relapse-free and overall survival in breast cancer, predominantly in locally advanced and metastatic disease. A paucity of data is available on the prognostic implications of VEGF in early-stage breast cancer; specifically, its prognostic value for local relapse after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is largely unknown. The purpose of our study was to assess VEGF expression in a cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients treated with BCT and to correlate the clinical and pathologic features and outcomes with overexpression of VEGF. Methods and Materials: After obtaining institutional review board approval, the paraffin specimens of 368 patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with BCT between 1975 and 2005 were constructed into tissue microarrays with twofold redundancy. The tissue microarrays were stained for VEGF and read by a trained pathologist, who was unaware of the clinical details, as positive or negative according the standard guidelines. The clinical and pathologic data, long-term outcomes, and results of VEGF staining were analyzed. Results: The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 6.5 years. VEGF expression was positive in 56 (15%) of the 368 patients. Although VEGF expression did not correlate with age at diagnosis, tumor size, nodal status, histologic type, family history, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status, or HER-2 status, a trend was seen toward increased VEGF expression in the black cohort (26% black vs. 13% white, p =.068). Within the margin-negative cohort, VEGF did not predict for local relapse-free survival (RFS) (96% vs. 95%), nodal RFS (100% vs. 100%), distant metastasis-free survival (91% vs. 92%), overall survival (92% vs. 97%), respectively (all p >.05). Subset analysis revealed that VEGF was highly predictive of local RFS in node-positive, margin-negative patients (86% vs. 100%, p =.029) on univariate analysis, but it did not retain its significance on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.804-7.920, p =.113). No other subgroups were identified in which a correlation was found between VEGF expression and local relapse. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the prognostic value of VEGF with the endpoint of local relapse in early-stage breast cancer treated with BCT, an important question given the recent increased use of targeted antiangiogenic agents in early-stage breast cancer. Our study results suggest that VEGF is not an independent predictor of local RFS after BCT, but additional, larger studies specifically analyzing the endpoint of VEGF and local relapse are warranted.

"Moreno, F., et al.",2000,External beam irradiation plus 192Ir implant after breast-preserving surgery in women with early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To provide more information for the clinician and to analyze the impact of the boost with brachytherapy on the local disease-free survival (LDFS), disease-free survival (DFS), specific overall survival (OS), and cosmesis, a retrospective study of external radiation therapy and 192Ir implantation in early breast cancer at Institut Catala d'Oncologia has been undertaken. Patients and Methods: From 1986 to 1996, 530 patients were selected for this study with a median follow-up period of 39.5 months (range, 10-115 months). External radiation therapy (combined with brachytherapy) was administered postoperatively to the breast in all patients. Mean given dose was 48.7 Gy (range, 42-52 Gy) with external radiation therapy to the breast, and 16.8 Gy (range, 10-27 Gy) was the mean dose with brachytherapy. Variables have been tested for cosmesis. Univariate and multivariate analysis have also been carried out. Results: Mean age of the patients was 54 years (range, 28- 81 years). Stages were distributed as follows: 350 patients (66%) in Stage I, 173 in Stage II (32.8%), and 7 in Stage III (1.1%). Pathologic distribution was 445 patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (84%), 20 patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma (4%), and 65 patients (12%) of a miscellaneous group. OS for the entire group was 89.4% and 85.9% at 5 and 7 years respectively. Probability of DFS was 81.7% and 70.1% at 5 and 7 years. The LDFS was 94.9% and 91.7% at 5 and 7 years. The MFS probability was 85.5% and 76.9% at 5 and 7 years, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that age (older than 52 years), premenopausal status, moderate and high histologic grades (Grades II-III), and presence of intraductal comedocarcinoma were prognostic factors for local relapse. Multivariate analysis for local disease-free survival demonstrated that only perineural or muscular infiltration remain as prognostic factors. Tumor dose bed of 70 Gy or higher had a negative impact in breast subcutaneous fibrosis, whereas dose rate lower than 65 cGy/h was better for skin color at 2 years. Conclusion: We conclude that patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing external radiotherapy and LDR brachytherapy can be effectively managed. Overall survival, long-term local control, and cosmetic control are excellent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc."
"Mose, S., et al.",2001,Influence of irradiation on therapy-associated psychological distress in breast carcinoma patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To confirm our assumptions regarding factors that apparently cause psychological distress related to adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer patients and to evaluate variables that can predict therapy-associated distress. Methods and Materials: Between January 1997 and April 1998, 111 women (33-84 years) with early-stage breast cancer were irradiated (56 Gy) after breast-conserving surgery. Patients were given self-assessment questionnaires on the first and last day of radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was performed using the structural equation model LISREL, variance analysis, and regression analysis. Results: The internal subject-related factors (coping, radiation-related anxiety, physical distress, psychological distress) reciprocally influenced each other, whereas external radiotherapy-specific factors (environmental influence, confidence in the medical staff) were causally related to coping, anxiety, and distress. Fifty-three percent of the women felt distressed because cancer affected the breast; 48% were initially afraid of radiotherapy. For 36%, anxiety was not reduced during treatment. Highly distressed women were identified by the following parameters: ≤58 years; initial anxiety; they were affected by having breast cancer, were negatively affected by environmental factors, and did not find distraction helpful. Conclusion: Despite considerable individual variability in breast cancer patients, it seems possible to identify women who run a high risk of therapy-associated distress. In these patients, psychosocial support is necessary to reduce treatment-related anxiety and to stabilize confidence in the medical staff.  Science Inc."
"Murphy, C., et al.",2011,Impact of the radiation boost on outcomes after breast-conserving surgery and radiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We examined the impact of radiation tumor bed boost parameters in early-stage breast cancer on local control and cosmetic outcomes. Methods and Materials: A total of 3,186 women underwent postlumpectomy whole-breast radiation with a tumor bed boost for Tis to T2 breast cancer from 1970 to 2008. Boost parameters analyzed included size, energy, dose, and technique. Endpoints were local control, cosmesis, and fibrosis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate actuarial incidence, and a Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine independent predictors of outcomes on multivariate analysis (MVA). The median follow-up was 78 months (range, 1-305 months). Results: The crude cosmetic results were excellent in 54%, good in 41%, and fair/poor in 5% of patients. The 10-year estimate of an excellent cosmesis was 66%. On MVA, independent predictors for excellent cosmesis were use of electron boost, lower electron energy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and whole-breast IMRT. Fibrosis was reported in 8.4% of patients. The actuarial incidence of fibrosis was 11% at 5 years and 17% at 10 years. On MVA, independent predictors of fibrosis were larger cup size and higher boost energy. The 10-year actuarial local failure was 6.3%. There was no significant difference in local control by boost method, cut-out size, dose, or energy. Conclusions: Likelihood of excellent cosmesis or fibrosis are associated with boost technique, electron energy, and cup size. However, because of high local control and rare incidence of fair/poor cosmesis with a boost, the anatomy of the patient and tumor cavity should ultimately determine the necessary boost parameters.

"Murphy, C., et al.",2014,Questioning the benefit of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) in elderly women with early-stage hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation therapy (RT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Phase 3 data suggest that adjuvant ET alone in elderly women with low risk, early stage HR+ breast cancer results in acceptable outcomes when compared to treatment with adjuvant RT plus ET (RT + ET). Randomized data examining the role of adjuvant RT alone in this group of favorable risk women is lacking. We aim to compare outcomes and toxicity for elderly women treated with adjuvant RT alone vs RT + ET. Materials/Methods: We queried our IRB-approved database for patients (pts) with the following inclusion criteria: age ≤ 65, tumor stage T1-2 N0, estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, and treatment with BCS and adjuvant RT. We examined the following clinical outcomes: local control (LC), regional control (RC), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and cosmesis. Adherence to ET was defined as completion of 5 years of prescribed ET or currently taking ET at the time of last follow-up. We determined predictors of outcome using Cox proportional hazard methods for multivariate analyses (MVA). Kaplan-Meier methods estimated survival functions and were compared using the log-rank test. Results: We included 504 pts treated from 1981-2011, and 311 (62%) were treated with RT + ET. Median values for the population were: followup, 88 months; age, 71 years (range 65-88); tumor size, 1.2 cm (range 0.1- 5 cm). The RT group was older (72 vs 71 years, p = 0.05), had smaller tumors (1 vs 1.3 cm, p = 0.01), lower grade (60% moderate/high grade vs 71%, p = 0.05), and had fewer close/positive margins (11% vs 19%, p = 0.01). In the RT + ET cohort, the adherence rate to prescribed ET was 70%, and median duration of therapy was 4 yrs. Actuarial 10-year rates for LC, RC, FFDM, DFS and OS for the RT vs RT + ET groups were: 98% vs 98% (p =0.68), 99% vs 99% (p= 0.71), 94% vs 90% (p= 0.30), and 92% vs 88% (p = 0.47), respectively. No MVA predictors of LC or RC were identified. On MVA, tumor size predicted for increased risk of DM (p = 0.004, HR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-3.1) and DFS (p = 0.004, HR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9). Non-adherence to prescribed ET was the strongest predictor of DM (p < 0.001, HR = 5.0, 95% CI = 2.0-12.7), and DFS (p < 0.001, HR = 8.8, 95% CI = 1.9-10.3) on MVA. The 10-yr actuarial FFDM rates for RT vs RT + ET adherent vs RT + ET non-adherent were 94% vs 94% vs 74% (p < 0.01), and DFS rates of 92% vs 91% vs 72% (p < 0.01). Twenty-six of 31 pts (83.8%) with DM had tumors > 1 cm in size. The rate of excellent/good cosmesis was similar for RT vs RT + ET, 91% vs 93% (p = 0.4). Conclusions: Treatment with adjuvant RT alone in elderly women with small, node-negative, HR+ invasive breast cancer results in acceptable outcomes. Increasing tumor size and non-adherence to ET predicted for increased risk of DM and DFS in elderly women treated with BCS and RT."
"Nam, J. and H. Jeon",2013,Quantitative analysis of lung CT density changes in early breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate differences in lung CT density changes of breast cancer patients treated with whole-breast hypofractionated radiation therapy compared to conventional whole-breast radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Between September 2009 and February 2012, 32 patients with early breast cancer were treated with hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy. During the same periods, 83 patients with early breast cancer patients were treated with conventional whole-breast radiation therapy. We have evaluated follow-up lung CT scans of both patient groups performed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after radiation therapy. To extract lung regions in the radiation fields, co-registration with radiation therapy planning CT scan and serial follow-up lung CT scan images was done. For the comparison of differences in lung CT density changes, we have measured relative mean lung density changes (%HU) from the ipsilateral and contralateral lung regions, and calculated relative difference ratio in mean lung density changes in irradiated area. Patient characteristics and dosimetric parameters were compared between the patient groups. Results: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics. Lung volumes included in the tangential radiation fields were similar in both groups. Follow-up durations were median 26 months (range, 12-42 months). There was no grade 3 or more radiation pneumonitis patients in both groups. In hypofractionated and conventional whole-breast radiation therapy group, the ratios of relative mean lung density changes were median 9.4% (range, 2%-40%) and 9.8% (range, 0%-34%) at 6 mos, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference of lung density changes in two treatment groups. No significant statistical difference was observed in serial trends of mean lung density changes during the follow-up periods in both patient groups. Conclusions: We have not found any significant differences in lung CT density changes in patients treated with hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy compared to patients with conventional whole-breast radiation therapy."
"Nam, J., et al.",2011,Impact of partially untreated breast target volume on the local regional recurrence in patients with early-stage left breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the impact of partially untreated breast target volume in early stage left breast cancer patients who have been treated with tangential radiotherapy. Materials/Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed in early stage breast cancer patients treated between January 2003 and November 2004. Total 161 patients were included. There were 79 left breast cancers. All patients received radiotherapy using 3-dimensional conformal treatment planning system with computed tomography simulation. Two tangential fields were used. Daily 1.8 - 2.0 Gy per fraction was delivered. Whole breast received median 50.4 Gy and 9 Gy of tumor bed electron boost. In most left side breast cancer patients, to minimize cardiac myocardial damage, customized cardiac shields were added in the tangential fields excluding the entire heart in the selected patients. Minimum distance of 1cm from cardiac border to breast target volume was required to add cardiac shields. To evaluate the cardiac abnormality, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, or single photon emission computed tomography were performed in patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease. Survival analysis was performed and prognostic factors were evaluated. χ2test and Fisher exact test were also performed. Results: Median follow up was median 6.6 years. Cardiac shields were used in 65 patients. Median 5% (range, 3-11%) of clinical target volume of whole breast was excluded from the tangential fields due to the cardiac shields. Overall 5 year survival rate was 97%, and 5 year recurrence rate was 3.8%. Most of the recurrences were distant metastasis (83%). There were no significant statistical differences in local and regional recurrences and survival rates between patients with or without the cardiac shields. Extensive intraductal component, lymphovascular invasion, T stage, and age were statistically significant in univariate analysis, but none of them was significant in multivariate analysis. Partially untreated breast target volume was not a significant prognostic factor. Conclusions: Cardiac shield techniques may be safely performed in early stage left breast cancer patients without increasing recurrences or survival loss. Further clinical study is required to confirm our results."
"Narayanan, S. S., et al.",2003,Intraoperative high-dose-rate 192Ir radical implant in early breast cancer: A quality assurance and dosimetry study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the variability in catheter length, geometry, and dosimetric parameters of radical intraoperative high-dose-rate breasts implant during 7-11 days. Methods and Materials: Simulator X-rays, CT scans, and dosimetric studies were repeated on alternate days in 14 consecutive patients treated with radical intraoperative two- or three-plane nylon catheter high-dose-rate implant (34 Gy in 10 fractions within 5 days). Results: Significant variation was found in catheter length, but no major change was noted in implant geometry, homogeneity, or inhomogeneity indexes. A variation in length of >5 mm in one or more catheters was seen in all patients and >10 mm in 11 patients at any time during the implant. Of the 171 catheters in 14 patients, 100 (58%) and 38 (22%) showed a variation of >5 mm or >10 mm, respectively. The variation of >10 mm was reduced from 32% of catheters in the first 5 patients to 17% in the subsequent 9 patients (p = 0.028). Rigid catheter fixation might reduce length variation but may cause skin necrosis if the expanding cavity indents the skin for a long period against the fixation device. A dose homogeneity index of 0.90 (range 0.85-0.92) and dose nonuniformity ratio of 0.20 (range 0.12-0.25) were satisfactory. Conclusion: The catheter fixation and exit catheter length should be measured daily and if the implant is in situ for more than a few days, orthogonal X-rays and, if indicated, dosimetry should be repeated at least once.

"Natarajan, B., et al.",2018,Findings on Surveillance Imaging After Preoperative Partial Breast Irradiation for Early Stage Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the mammographic sequelae of preoperative accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered via either stereotactic radiosurgery or a conventionally fractionated regimen. Methods and Materials: This multicenter, retrospective study evaluated surveillance mammograms from patients enrolled in 2 prospective, preoperative APBI clinical trials. At 1 site, 31 patients with cT1N0 invasive carcinomas or low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (<2 cm) received preoperative stereotactic radiosurgery and had a total of 186 mammograms available for review. At the second site, 180 mammograms from 25 patients with cT1-2 (<3 cm) unifocal invasive carcinomas treated with conventionally fractionated, preoperative APBI were reviewed. Findings were compared with those of 26 early stage breast cancers treated with conventional postoperative whole breast radiation therapy. Results: At a median follow-up of 61 months, 17 patients (55%) treated with single-dose APBI exhibited exuberant fat necrosis at the lumpectomy site. Fat necrosis was believed to be clinically palpable in 5 (16%) of these patients within the first 3 years of follow-up. Exuberant fat necrosis developed in 5 patients (20%) treated with fractionated APBI over a median 68-month follow-up period but only 2 of those patients (8%) who underwent conventional whole breast radiation therapy. Conclusions: In situ tumor targeting in the preoperative setting allows relative sparing of normal tissue but results in a larger and more vigorous area of change on surveillance imaging, potentially reflecting the interaction of surgical resection with an irradiated tissue bed. High-dose stereotactic radiosurgery in particular increases the risk of developing a uniquely robust and well-demarcated pattern of fat necrosis on mammogram that may also present clinically. With many ongoing studies evaluating the preoperative treatment approach, defining the landscape of expected imaging sequelae will provide useful anticipatory guidance for clinicians and patients."
"Neboori, H., et al.",2011,"The prognostic value of MDM2,MDM4(MDMX), and P53 in early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): MDM2, MDM4 and p53 are involved in a negative feedback loop that targets p53 for destruction. This loop however may be broken in response to genotoxic insults resulting in cellular progression toward apoptosis. As such we hypothesized that aberrant MDM2/MDM4/p53 protein expression may have prognostic value in determining local response to radiation in early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation (BCS + RT). Materials/Methods: Breast tumor tissue from a cohort of 514 women (range, 25-88 years) with early-stage invasive breast cancer were treated with BCS+RT and constructed into a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical staining of the array for MDM2, MDM4, p53, ER, PR, HER2/neu was scored as either positive or negative in accordance with standard procedures. The staining profile of each tumor was correlated with local recurrence factors including ipsilateral breast recurrence survival (IBRFS), nodal recurrence free survival (NRFS) and loco-regional recurrence free survival (LRFS). The associations between MDM2, MDM4, p53, other co-variables, and outcomes were assessed in a multivariate model. Results: As of September 2009, median follow-up of the cohort was 6.72 years. 8.6% (n = 26), 56.7% (n = 174), 31.0% (n = 140) of the tumors were scored positive for MDM2, MDM4, and p53, respectively. All 3 stains were interpretable in 276 cores. Positive scoring of MDM2 was found to correlate with worse 10 year IBRFS (75.0% vs. 90.0%; p = 0.032) and worse LRFS (65.6% vs. 88.5%; p = 0.017) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Neither MDM4 nor p53 were seen to correlate with any local endpoints. On multivariate analysis incorporating MDM2, age, race, tumor size and margin status only MDM2 was again significant for IBRFS and LRFS (p = 0.027 and p = 0.007), respectively). As MDM2 has been shown to enhance estrogen-responsiveness through interactions with ERα, the prognostic value of MDM2 was assessed on ER+ vs. ER- subsets. MDM2 was found to be predictive of local recurrence only in the ER+ subsets on multivariate analysis for IBFRS and LRFS (p = 0.014 and p = 0.014, respectively). It was not predictive in the ER-subset. Conclusions: Our data indicate that MDM2 is an independent predictor for local recurrence in conservatively treated, early stage breast cancer. This suggests its possible use as a marker for prognostic outcome; however, these results should be validated in larger cohorts."
"Neboori, H. J. R., et al.",2012,Low p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) expression is associated with increased local recurrence in breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To investigate whether the expression of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) has prognostic significance in a cohort of early-stage breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy (BCS+RT). Methods and Materials: A tissue microarray of early-stage breast cancer treated with BCS+RT from a cohort of 514 women was assayed for 53BP1, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry. Through log-rank tests and univariate and multivariate models, the staining profile of each tumor was correlated with clinical endpoints, including ipsilateral breast recurrence-free survival (IBRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Of the 477 (93%) evaluable tumors, 63 (13%) were scored as low. Low expression of 53BP1 was associated with worse outcomes for all endpoints studied, including 10-year IBRFS (76.8% vs. 90.5%; P=.01), OS (66.4% vs. 81.7%; P=.02), CSS (66.0% vs. 87.4%; P<.01), DMFS (55.9% vs. 87.0%; P<.01), and RFS (45.2% vs. 80.6%; P<.01). Multivariate analysis incorporating various clinico-pathologic markers and 53BP1 expression found that 53BP1 expression was again an independent predictor of all endpoints (IBRFS: P=.0254; OS: P=.0094; CSS: P=.0033; DMFS: P=.0006; RFS: P=.0002). Low 53BP1 expression was also found to correlate with triple-negative (TN) phenotype (P<.01). Furthermore, in subset analysis of all TN breast cancer, negative 53BP1 expression trended for lower IBRFS (72.3% vs. 93.9%; P=.0361) and was significant for worse DMFS (48.2% vs. 86.8%; P=.0035) and RFS (37.8% vs. 83.7%; P=.0014). Conclusion: Our data indicate that low 53BP1 expression is an independent prognostic indicator for local relapse among other endpoints in early-stage breast cancer and TN breast cancer patients treated with BCS+RT. These results should be verified in larger cohorts of patients to validate their clinical significance.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Nelson, C., et al.",2011,Early results of a novel hypofractionated schedule for adjuvant radiation therapy in early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Currently reported trials of conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI) or hypofractionated (HF) WBI in patients with early stage breast cancer have shown comparable clinical and cosmetic outcomes. These trials have informed the current ASTRO guidelines for HF-WBI. Unresolved questions include the appropriateness of excluding patients with large chest wall separations, use of a breast boost in this setting, and the suitability of DCIS patients and node-positive patients.We designed a prospective phase II trial of a novel HF-WBI schedule for early stage breast cancer that incorporates a boost and limits treatment to 3 weeks. Materials/Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, 49 patients were treated at RWJUH with adjuvant breast irradiation for T1-T2 invasive breast cancer or DCIS following lumpectomy ± chemotherapy. Assuming linear-quadratic formalism and with a comparator schedule of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, we treated our study patients with WBI of 3663 Gy in 11 fractions using opposed tangents, and a boost to the tumor bed of 1332 Gy in 4 fractions using electrons or photons. Patients were not excluded from this trial based on age or chest wall separation. Treatment plans and DVH data were analyzed for dose homogeneity and patient charts were reviewed for acute and late toxicity based on common terminology criteria for adverse events. Results: The median patient age was 53 yrs (range: 39-79) with 13 patients<50 yrs. Median chest wall separation was 21.4 cm (range: 15.8-30.5) with .25 cm separation in 8 patients and median irradiated breast volume was 1414 cc (range: 430-2947). Electron boost was used in 34 patients (69%) and photon boost used in 15 (31%), with 2 patients treated in prone position and 47 supine. DVH analysis showed PTV D95 ≥ 95% of prescribed dose in 47/49 plans (96%). The median Dmax to the central- axis plane was 105.9% (range: 103-109%) and median Dmax to the entire irradiated breast was 105% (range: 101-108%). With median follow-up of 7.3 months (range: 1-19), acute grade 1 and grade 2 skin toxicity was reported in 59% and 37% of patients respectively and long term (.6 month) grade 1 and 2 skin toxicity was noted in 35% and 2.9% of patients, respectively. Although breast separation .25 cm was associated with higher Dmax to the whole breast (p = 0.012), this was not a significant predictors for acute toxicity (p = 0.59). Conclusions: In this trial of HF-WBI with sequential boost delivered in only 15 fractions, we have achieved ample PTV coverage while maintaining reasonable dose homogeneity for varied chest separation with no associated increase in acute skin toxicity. This novel fractionation schedule is the shortest continuous course HF-WBI schedule that is inclusive of a boost."
"Nelson, C., et al.",2010,Racial disparities in treatment outcomes for african american women with ductal carcinoma in situ receiving whole breast irradiation following Breast Conserving Surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recent studies have identified potential disparities in treatment outcomes for African American (AA) vs. white patients with early stage invasive breast cancer. However, few studies have examined similar endpoints by racial grouping in patients with DCIS. This analysis evaluated a large cohort of DCIS patients treated with whole breast radiation therapy (RT) following breast conserving surgery (BCS) to identify any differences between these two groups. Materials/Methods: Between 1974 and 2009, 532 patients with DCIS were treated with whole breast RT +/- boost following BCS at Yale & RWJUH. Patients included 448 (84.2%) whites, 51 (9.6%) AA, and 33 (6.2%) patients of other race. Patient characteristics included clinical and pathologic data, hormone receptor status, treatment course, and recurrence data. Summary and survival statistics were analyzed to evaluate differences between the white and AA patients. Results: With median follow-up of 6.1 years (range, 0.1-26), white and AA DCIS patients were diagnosed at mean age of 57.1 and 55.6 yrs, respectively (p =\0.001). Low, intermediate and high grade DCIS was found in 27.5%, 39.4%, 33.1% of white patients and 39%, 39%, 22% of AA patients (p = 0.16). Necrosis was present in 151/243 (62%) of whites and 13/34 (38%) of AA patients (p = 0.0006). ER positivity was found in 72/137 (52.6%) of white vs. 14/18 (77.8%) of AA patients (p = 0.039) and 146/439 (33%) white vs. 21/51 (41%) AA received adjuvant hormones. Outcomes analysis revealed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence free survival (IBTRFS) of 96.8% and 93.7% for whites and 96.7% and 92.6% for AA at 5 and 10 years, respectively (p = 0.8). In those patients treated with hormonal therapy, the IBTRFS at 5 and 10 years was 99% and 99% in the white cohort and 100% and 100% in the AA cohort (p = 0.9); with only 1/147 patients in either group experiencing an IBTR when treated with hormonal therapy. The 5 and 10 year rate of contralateral breast tumor free survival was 97% and 94% in the white cohort and 95.5% and 90.9% in the AA cohort (p = 0.8). Conclusions: In this review of 532 DCIS patients treated with BCS and RT, African American patients were found to have more favorable histological features of their disease, including lower DCIS grade and lower percentage DCIS necrosis than whites, while having a higher percentage of ER positive tumors and a higher proportion receiving adjuvant hormones."
"Nemani, D., et al.",2009,Outcomes After Breast Conservation Treatment With Radiation in Women With Prior Nonbreast Malignancy and Subsequent Invasive Breast Carcinoma.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Little information has been reported regarding outcomes after treatment for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer and a prior nonbreast malignancy. This report analyzes the outcomes in patients with Stage I and II breast cancer after breast conservation treatment (BCT) with a prior nonbreast malignancy. Methods and Materials: The study cohort comprised 66 women with invasive breast cancer and a prior nonbreast malignancy. All patients were treated with breast conservation surgery followed by definitive breast irradiation between 1978 and 2003. Median ages at diagnosis of invasive breast cancer and prior malignancy were 57 and 50 years, respectively. The median interval between the prior malignancy and breast cancer was 7.0 years. Median and mean follow-up times after BCT were 5.3 and 7.0 years. Results: The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82-98%) and 78% (95% CI, 59-89%), respectively. There were 4 patients (6%) with local failure and 10 patients (15%) with distant metastases. The 10-year rate of local failure rate was 5% (95% CI, 2-16%) and freedom from distant metastases was 78% (95% CI, 61-88%). No obvious differences in survival or local control were noted compared with the reported results in the literature for patients with invasive breast cancer alone. Conclusions: Both overall survival and local control at 5 and 10 years were comparable to rates observed in early-stage breast cancer patients without a prior malignancy. Prior nonbreast malignancy is not a contraindication to BCT, if the primary cancer is effectively controlled.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Neumaier, C., et al.",2015,First safety analysis after 80 treated patients with early breast cancer within the targit-e trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): As a prospective single-arm observational study (phase II) the TARGIT-E trial (Trial registration NCT01299987) was designed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of IORT (intraoperative radiation therapy) alone in elderly patients (≥70 years) with low risk invasive ductal breast cancer (cT1 cN0). Here, we report the results of the first predefined safety analysis. Materials/Methods: 80 patients were treated according to the TARGIT-E protocol. Therefore they received breast-conserving surgery and e whenever possible e IORT with 20 Gy to the applicator surface. WBRT (whole breast radiation therapy) was only added to IORT if risk factors were evident in the final pathology report or used as an alternative when IORT was not applicable. Primary endpoint was the rate of local recurrence. Secondary endpoints were ipsi- or contralateral breast cancer, cancer specific and overall survival, cosmetic outcome and quality of life. All patients were treated with breast-conserving surgery. In 51% patients IORT only was given, in 36% patients IORT was followed by WBRT and in 13% patients no IORT was applicable. Results: With a median follow up of 20.5 months all patients were alive and no local relapse was reported. 7 SAE (serious adverse event) within 7 patients were documented, where 2 SAE had potential associations to IORT alone and 3 SAE had potential associations to IORT and WBRT. 4 of these 5 radiation related toxicities resolved after conservative treatment. In 1 case surgical revision of a cutaneous fistula was performed. No long-lasting complications occurred in patients treated with IORT only. The other 2 SAE were not radiation associated. No SUSAR (serious unexpected adverse reaction) and no grade IV or V toxicities were recorded. Conclusion: The concept of targeted intraoperative radiation therapy alone with 20 Gy applied with the Intrabeam system in elderly patients is safe and feasible. To confirm these results longer follow-up is needed."
"Ng, J., et al.",2012,Predicting the risk of secondary lung malignancies associated with whole-breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The risk of secondary lung malignancy (SLM) is a significant concern for women treated with whole-breast radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer. In this study, a biologically based secondary malignancy model was used to quantify the risk of secondary lung malignancies (SLMs) associated with several common methods of delivering whole-breast radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: Both supine and prone computed tomography simulations of 15 women with early breast cancer were used to generate standard fractionated and hypofractionated whole-breast RT treatment plans for each patient. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the ipsilateral breast and lung were calculated for each patient on each plan. A model of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis was used to determine the relative risks of SLMs for the different treatment techniques. Results: A higher risk of SLMs was predicted for supine breast irradiation when compared with prone breast irradiation for both the standard fractionation and hypofractionation schedules (relative risk [RR] = 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.30-2.88, and RR = 2.68, 95% CI = 2.39-2.98, respectively). No difference in risk of SLMs was noted between standard fractionation and hypofractionation schedules in either the supine position (RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.97-1.14) or the prone position (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88-1.15). Conclusions: Compared with supine whole-breast irradiation, prone breast irradiation is associated with a significantly lower predicted risk of secondary lung malignancy. In this modeling study, fractionation schedule did not have an impact on the risk of SLMs in women treated with whole-breast RT for early breast cancer.  Inc."
"Ng, J., et al.",2011,Predicted risk of secondary lung malignancies from breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The risk of secondary lung malignancy (SLM) is a significant concern for women treated with breast radiation therapy. Supine whole breast radiotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer after breast conserving therapy. Prone whole breast radiotherapy and partial breast irradiation have emerged as clinically accepted alternative options in some cases. In this study, a novel biologically-based carcinogenesis model was used to quantify and to compare the predicted rates of secondary lung malignancies for the three different treatment techniques. Materials/Methods: Computed tomography-based treatment plans were generated for fifteen early stage breast cancer patients using supine whole breast, prone whole breast, and partial breast 3-D conformal radiotherapy techniques. In addition, seven patients were simulated for balloon brachytherapy treatment planning. The treated breast and ipsilateral lung were contoured, and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs were determined. A biologically-based mathematical model of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis was used to determine the excess absolute risk of secondary lung malignancies for the different techniques. These risks were compared for each technique and to the baseline population. Results: Prone breast radiotherapy plans delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral lung in all patients in our study compared with partial breast irradiation and supine whole breast irradiation. The average mean lung doses for the ipsilateral lung were measured to be 54 cGy for prone whole breast irradiation vs. 275 cGy for 3-D conformal partial breast irradiation vs. 307 cGy for balloon brachytherapy partial breast irradiation vs. 646 cGy for supine whole breast irradiation (p< 0.0001). A significantly higher risk of secondary lung cancers was predicted for supine whole breast irradiation when compared with prone whole breast irradiation (RR 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.29-2.93) and partial breast irradiation (RR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33-1.81). Conclusions: For patients with early stage breast cancer, prone whole breast radiation therapy is associated with more than twofold lower predicted secondary lung cancer risk when compared with supine whole breast radiation therapy. Partial breast irradiation is also associated with a lower predicted secondary lung cancer risk when compared with supine whole breast radiotherapy but to a smaller extent than prone breast radiotherapy."
"Nguyen, B. T., et al.",2011,A prospective pathologic study to define the clinical target volume (CTV) for partial breast radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Partial breast radiotherapy is an emerging paradigm in the treatment of breast cancer but the optimal volume of tissue to irradiate remains uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine an appropriate clinical target volume (CTV) for partial breast radiotherapy based on the distribution of residual invasive and in situ carcinoma in re-excision specimens following breast conserving surgery. Materials/Methods:Women who had re-excision(s) and/or completion mastectomy following breast conserving surgery for invasive and/or in situ breast cancer were prospectively accrued between April 2008 and December 2010 from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne. Further re-excision surgery was performed at the discretion of the treating surgeon but was generally undertaken for involved or close margins. Patient and tumor features were entered in a database and a pathologic reporting protocol was used to define and report the distance (mm) of the maximum radial extension (MRE) of residual tumor from the margin of the initial resection cavity. Women were stratified by the width of the nearest initial radial resection margin as being negative (>1 mm), close (>0 mm and ≤1 mm), or involved. Results: The study population consisted of 133 eligible women of median age 59 years (range, 27 - 82 years) comprised of the following stage groups: 0 (18), I (50), II (55), and III (10). The primary lesion consisted of the following histological subtypes: invasive ductal carcinoma (74.4%), invasive lobular carcinoma (12.0%), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only (13.5%). The invasive carcinomas were 89.4% estrogen receptor (ER) positive, 80.5% progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and 8.0% HER-2 positive. There were 56 women with an initial involved margin and residual disease was identified in the re-excision specimen(s) from 31 (55.4%). In 13 (23.2%) of these cases, the MRE was greater than 10 mm. Residual disease was identified in only 1 (8.3%) of the 12 women with a close margin and 6 (9.2%) of the 65 with a negative margin. For the 77 women with an initial non-involved (close or negative) margin the MRE of residual disease (if any) was ≤10 mm in 97.4% (95% CI, 91.6 - 99.5%) of cases with p = 0.014 using a one-sided hypothesis test that the proportion is greater than 0.9. Conclusions: ACTVmargin of 10mmshould encompass microscopic residual disease in.90%patients potentially eligible for partial breast irradiation.More than half of women with involved margins have residual disease in re-excision specimens and in nearly a quarter this extends beyond 10mm. Thesewomen may benefit from re-excision surgerywith awide margin prior to further therapy."
"Nguyen, B. T., et al.",2012,A prospective pathologic study to define the clinical target volume for partial breast radiation therapy in women with early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine an appropriate clinical target volume for partial breast radiation therapy (PBRT) based on the spatial distribution of residual invasive and in situ carcinoma after wide local excision (WLE) for early breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Methods and Materials: We performed a prospective pathologic study of women potentially eligible for PBRT who had re-excision and/or completion mastectomy after WLE for early breast cancer or DCIS. A pathologic assessment protocol was used to determine the maximum radial extension (MRE) of residual carcinoma from the margin of the initial surgical cavity. Women were stratified by the closest initial radial margin width: negative (>1 mm), close (>0 mm and ≤1 mm), or involved. Results: The study population was composed of 133 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 27-82 years) and the following stage groups: 0 (13.5%), I (40.6%), II (38.3%), and III (7.5%). The histologic subtypes of the primary tumor were invasive ductal carcinoma (74.4%), invasive lobular carcinoma (12.0%), and DCIS alone (13.5%). Residual carcinoma was present in the re-excision and completion mastectomy specimens in 55.4%, 14.3%, and 7.2% of women with an involved, close, and negative margin, respectively. In the 77 women with a noninvolved radial margin, the MRE of residual disease, if present, was ≤10 mm in 97.4% (95% confidence interval 91.6-99.5) of cases. Larger MRE measurements were significantly associated with an involved margin (P<.001), tumor size >30 mm (P=.03), premenopausal status (P=.03), and negative progesterone receptor status (P=.05). Conclusions: A clinical target volume margin of 10 mm would encompass microscopic residual disease in >90% of women potentially eligible for PBRT after WLE with noninvolved resection margins.  Inc.

"Niazi, T., et al.",2011,What is the actual rate of acute skin toxicity in women undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy for early breast cancer? Final results of a single institution phase II study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The rate of acute skin toxicity (AST) for irradiated breast is reported at 40-50% for G-II or higher and 15- 20% for G-III moist desquamation. In this phase II study we evaluated the actual rate of AST in these patients (Pts) and correlated that with Pt characteristics. Materials/Methods: Pts with breast separation<25cm were treated with Canadian hypofractionation (HF) regimen (42.4Gy/16) while Pts with . 25cm were treated with 50Gy/25. All Pts were advised to apply hydrating cream from day 1 of the RT. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE) was used for grading of the AST. To avoid subjective interpretation of the CTCAE, each Pt was graded by 2 oncologists at wks 0, 2, 3, last day of treatment (Tx) and 2 wks after Tx. Univariant and multivariant analysis were performed to evaluate the contribution of Pt characteristics to the toxicity. Results: One hundred sixty Pts with a median age of 59 were included in this analysis. Of these, 69% received the HF and 62% had an extra boost. Seventy Pts (44%) received chemotherapy prior to RTand 21% were active smokers. The volume of the breast varied significantly with a median volume of 760 cc (153-2271). AST was 17% at 2 weeks with only 4 Pts (2.5%) having G-II , 47% at 3 weeks with only 10 Pts (6%) having G-II and 78% at the last day of the Tx with 32% having G-II or higher. Only 13 (8%) Pts had G-III and no G-IVASTwas observed. The rate of residual skin reaction at 2 wk post RTwas 34% with only 8 (5%) G-II and one G-III. Univariate analysis associated the breast volume<1000 cc with decreased ASTat the last day of the treatment with an OR of 0.48 (p = 0.0204), and active smoking with delayed skin healing at 2 wks post RT with an OR of 0.435 (p = 0.0482). AST was significantly lower for patients who received HF vs standard fractionation at the last day of the treatment, 75% vs 98% (p = 0028), respectively. This difference was not maintained at 2 wks after treatment completion. Conclusions: The actual rate of ASTin women undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy for BCTis considerably overstated in medical literature. Hypofractionation and smaller breasts are associated with decreased acute skin reaction at the last day of radiation therapy and active smoking is correlated with delayed healing."

Patients and Methods This was a prospective trial testing the feasibility of preoperative APBI followed by lumpectomy for patients with early-stage invasive ductal breast cancer. Eligible patients had T1-T2 (<3 cm), N0 tumors. Patients received 38.5 Gy in 3.85-Gy fractions delivered twice daily. Surgery was performed >21 days after radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy was given as per standard of care. Results Twenty-seven patients completed treatment. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 0.5-5 years), there have been no local or regional failures. A complete pathologic response according to hematoxylin and eosin stains was seen in 4 patients (15%). There were 4 grade 3 seromas. Patient-reported cosmetic outcome was rated as good to excellent in 79% of patients after treatment. Conclusions Preoperative 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy−APBI is feasible and well tolerated in select patients with early-stage breast cancer, with no reported local recurrences and good to excellent cosmetic results. The pathologic response rates associated with this nonablative APBI dose regimen are particularly encouraging and support further exploration of this paradigm."
"Nichols, E. M., et al.",2010,Comparative Analysis of the Post-Lumpectomy Target Volume Versus the Use of Pre-Lumpectomy Tumor Volume for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Implications for the Future.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Three-dimensional conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI-3D-CRT) is commonly associated with the treatment of large amounts of normal breast tissue. We hypothesized that a planning tumor volume (PTV) generation based on an expansion of the pre-lumpectomy (pre-LPC) intact tumor volume would result in smaller volumes of irradiated normal breast tissue compared with using a PTV based on the post-lumpectomy cavity (post-LPC). Use of PTVs based on the pre-LPC might also result in greater patient eligibility for APBI-3D-CRT. Methods and Materials: Forty-one early-stage breast cancers were analyzed. Preoperative imaging was used to determine a pre-LPC tumor volume. PTVs were developed in the pre- and post-LPC settings as per National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)-B39 guidelines. The pre- and post-LPC PTV volumes were compared and eligibility for APBI-3D-CRT determined using NSABP-B39 criteria. Results: The post-LPC PTV exceeded the pre-LPC PTV in all cases. The median volume for the pre- and post-LPC PTVs were 93 cm3 (range, 24-570 cm3) and 250 cm3 (range, 45-879 cm3), respectively, p <0.001. The difference between pre- and post-LPC PTVs represented a median of 165 cc (range, 21-482 cc) or 16% (range, 3%-42%) of the whole breast volume. Three of 41 vs. 13 of 41 cases were ineligible for APBI-3D-CRT when using the pre- and post-LPC PTVs, respectively. Conclusion: PTVs based on pre-LPC tumor expansion are likely associated with reduced amounts of irradiated normal breast tissue compared with post-LPC PTVs, possibly leading to greater patient eligibility for APBI-3D-CRT. These findings support future investigation as to the feasibility of neoadjuvant APBI-3D-CRT.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Nichols, E. M., et al.",2014,Prospective evaluation of preoperative 3D conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation (3DCRT-APBI) shows promising early results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We have previously reported the dosimetric benefits of preoperative 3DCRT-APBI as well as the preliminary findings of our first 10 patients receiving preoperative 3DCRT-APBI (ASTRO 2011). Here we present results with additional patient accrual. Materials/Methods: This is an IRB-approved prospective trial testing the feasibility of preoperative APBI followed by planned partial mastectomy for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Eligible patients had unifocal invasive breast cancers ≥ 3 cm and negative clinical axillary lymph nodes by ultrasound or MR imaging. If imaging suggested suspicious findings, a targeted biopsy was required to confirm a negative axilla. Invasive lobular or pure in situ cancers were excluded. The gross tumor volume was the preoperative tumor as seen on CT. Clinical and planning target volumes were expansions similar to those used in RTOG 0319. Patients received 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy fractions delivered twice daily at least 6 hours apart. Partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed at least 21 days following completion of radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy was given as per standard of care. Results: Twenty-five of a planned 40 patients have completed protocol treatment thus far. Median patient age was 64 years (range, 51-85 years), and median preoperative tumor size was 1.1 cm (range, 0.45-3 cm). Tumor grade was as follows: nine patients with grade 1; 14 with grade 2, and two with grade 3. Receptor status showed 19 patients to be ER/PR+, HER 2-; one patient triple positive; one patient triple negative; and two patients ER+, PR/HER 2-. With a median follow-up of 27.6 months (range, 5.8- 43.3 months), no local, regional, or distant failures have been noted. Surgery was performed at a median of 31 days after completion of radiation therapy (range, 21-63 days). A complete pathologic response based on H&E staining was seen in 4 patients (17%). Three patients underwent re-excision for close or positive margins. Three patients were found to have positive nodes at the time of surgery, and six underwent chemotherapy. There were four grade 3 toxicities of seroma formation. Patientreported cosmetic outcome was rated as good to excellent in the majority (79%) of cases. Conclusions: Preoperative 3DCRT-APBI is feasible and well tolerated in select patients with early-stage breast cancer, with no reported local recurrences. The pathologic response rates associated with this nonablative APBI dose regimen are particularly encouraging and support further exploration of the use of preoperative RT in the setting of breast conservation therapy. The final results from this study will provide valuable supporting data for our upcoming trials utilizing a preoperative radioablative approach for treatment of early-stage breast cancers."
"Nichols, E. M., et al.",2016,Dosimetric comparison of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) partial breast irradiation (PBI) and a breast stereotactic radiation therapy (BSRT) device.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Perform a dosimetric comparison of IMPT PBI to BSRT. The BSRT device consists of 36 noncoplanar Co-60 sources that focus on a single isocenter that dynamically delivers the treatment through a rotating collimator.Dosimetrically, both techniques have advantages regarding normal tissue sparing in comparison to external beam PBI. External beam PBI has recently been shown to have worse cosmesis compared to conventional fractionation; therefore, if PBI is to be considered a standard treatment, improvements are required to result in better cosmesis. The aim of the present analysis is to compare which modality results in better normal tissue sparing, particularly to the normal breast tissue. We hypothesized that BSRT would result in better sparing of normal breast tissue. Materials/Methods: Nine patients previously treated with breastconserving therapy including radiation for early-stage breast cancer underwent CT simulation with the BSRT breast cup immobilization device (BCID) as part of an IRB-approved study. When utilizing the BSRT BCID, reproducibility studies have validated a planning target volume (PTV) margin of 3 mm. For proton therapy a similar immobilization device does not exist. In order to not skew results based on volumetric differences in PTV when utilizing different margins, an analysis was performed for both modalities utilizing a 10-mm margin consistent with that used in external beam therapies. For IMPT, single field optimization using 2 fields was utilized for added robustness. Dosimetrists were given identical treatment planning goals. Plans were then compared using 2-sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests for doses to normal structures. Results: BSRT resulted in decreased doses of RT to the following normal structures compared to IMPT: whole breast (WBV) V20% (PZ0.03), V50% (PZ0.03), V80% (PZ0.02), and V100% (PZ0.02); ipsilateral lung V15% (PZ0.05) and skin V15% (PZ0.05). BSRT resulted in increased max hot spot compared to IMPT PBI (PZ0.02). There was no benefit of BSRT compared to IMPT when comparing heart V15%, heart max dose, whole breast V5%, chest wall V15% and V25%, and lung V25%. The relative benefit in mean doses received by the WBV20, WBV50, WBV80, WBV100 with BSRT were 18%, 20%, 17%, and 11%, respectively. Conclusion: BSRT resulted in decreased doses of radiation to the normal breast tissue even when standardizing PTV margins due to lack of a similar immobilization device for IMPT. These doses are significantly decreased further when using the BSRT specific PTV margin (3 mm). Previous published data indicates a relationship between cosmetic outcome with low, intermediate and high doses of radiation to the breast. BSRT has the potential to further improve long-term fibrosis/cosmetic outcomes compared to other external beam therapies when used as a modality for PBI."
"Nichols, E. M., et al.",2015,Favorable proliferative response using KI-67 in patients prospectively treated with preoperative accelerated partial-breast radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Ki-67 is a marker of proliferation which has been used by medical oncologists to predict pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. In this analysis, we investigated whether Ki-67 would be a useful predictor of pathologic response for patients who were treated with pre-operative 3D conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation, (3D-CRT APBI). Materials/Methods: Twenty-seven patients completed treatment on an IRB approved protocol. Eligible patients were clinically node negative, with an invasive non-lobular carcinoma of the breast that was < 3 cm. Patients were treated with 3D-CRT APBI using similar expansions to NSABP B-39 replacing the tumor bed with the intact tumor. Dose was prescribed to 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy delivered BID with 6 hours between fractions over 5 days. Surgery was performed at least 21 days (median of 31 days) following RT. Ki-67 was measured using standard pathologic techniques on the core biopsy specimen as well as the lumpectomy specimen. Values were compared using a Student's T-test. Results: Median patient age was 64 (range: 51 - 85) and 26/27 patients had ER positive tumors. Ki-67 was available for 25/27 patients on the core biopsy specimen and 23/27 patients following lumpectomy. The median Ki-67 dropped from 14% (range: 2-77%) to 4.2% (range: 0 - 25.2%), a relative decrease of 70%. Five patients (18.5%) experienced a pathologic complete response (pCR) to pre-operative RTwhich was defined as no invasive tumor in the specimen (n=4) or Ki 67 that dropped to 0 (n=1). The pCR rate was seen in 3/5 patients with a Ki-67 > 14% but only 1/5 with a lower proliferation rate. One patient with a pCR did not have a pre-treatment Ki-67 available. All pts with a pCR were ER/PR+, her2neu- and were < 74 years old. Conclusion: Pre-operative RT resulted in a statistically significant decrease in Ki-67. While the sample size is small, high Ki-67 on biopsy as well as advanced age seemed to predict for a higher likelihood of pCR from preoperative radiation therapy. Ki-67 could give prognostic information and aid in better patient selection for pre-operative 3D-CRT APBI. Ki-67 will continue to be used and measured as a prognostic factor for additional upcoming studies."
"Nichols, M. A., et al.",2011,Outcomes in black patients with early breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: The race-specific impact of prognostic variables for early breast cancer is unknown for black patients undergoing breast conservation. Methods and Materials: This was a retrospective study of 1,231 consecutive patients ≥40 years of age with Stage I-II invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy at the University of Chicago Hospitals and affiliates between 1986 and 2004. Patients were classified as either black or nonblack. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the effects of known prognostic factors and interactions with race. Results: Median follow-up for surviving patients was 82 months. Thirty-four percent of patients were black, and 66% were nonblack (Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian). Black patients had a poorer 10-year overall survival (64.6% vs. 80.8%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-2.06) and 10-year disease-free survival (58.1% vs. 75.4%; HR 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.89) compared with nonblack patients. Tumor sizes were similar between nonblack and black patients with mammographically detected tumors (1.29 cm vs. 1.20 cm, p = 0.20, respectively). Tumor size was significantly associated with overall survival (HR 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.96) in black patients with mammographically detected tumors but not in nonblack patients (HR 1.09; 95% CI, 0.78-1.53), suggesting that survival in black patients depends more strongly on tumor size in this subgroup. Tests for race-size method of detection interactions were statistically significant for overall survival (p = 0.049), locoregional control (p = 0.036), and distant control (p = 0.032) and borderline significant for disease-free survival (p = 0.067). Conclusion: Despite detection at comparable sizes, the prognostic effect of tumor size in patients with mammographically detected tumors is greater for black than in nonblack patients.

"Niska, J. R., et al.",2015,Impact of level I evidence on radiation therapy utilization in breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Conventional radiation therapy (RT) regimens in breast conservation therapy (BCT) involve whole breast RT (WBRT), 45- 50 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions. The UK START and OCOG Trials showed the efficacy of hypofractionated (HF) regimens (39-42.5 Gy in 2.5-3.0 Gy fractions) in early stage breast cancer. CALGB established omission of RT as an option in select early stage breast cancer patients over 70. WBRT is most commonly delivered via 3D conformal RT (3DCRT) or intensity modulated RT (IMRT). IMRT is estimated to be at least twice the cost of 3DCRT. In 2013, the American Society for Radiation Oncology released 5 practice recommendations as part of the national “Choosing Wisely” campaign. For breast cancer, clinicians are encouraged to (1) consider shorter treatment schedules for women ≥ 50 with early stage breast cancer and (2) not routinely use IMRT to deliver WBRT. To assess our uptake of new evidence and adherence to recommendations, we evaluated RT use in select breast cancer patients at our institution in two periods, 2006-2008, and 2011-2013. Materials/Methods: Inclusion criteria were completion of BCT at our institution, post-menopausal, invasive ductal carcinoma, T1-T2, N0, M0, ER/PR+, and HER2 normal. Two periods were assessed, 2006-2008 and 2011-2013, defined by date of surgery. Patients were identified from a prospective breast cancer database. Medical records were reviewed to define RT modality, dose, and fractionation schedule. Cases were analyzed on intent to treat basis. Results: From 2006-2008, 66 cases met inclusion criteria (mean age 71.2, SD 9.0, range 51-89). RT utilization was as follows: HF WBRT in 12%, conventional WBRT in 52%, and brachytherapy (BT) in 20% of cases. RT was omitted in 17% of cases (mean age 80.6, SD 6.3, range 67-89) and 26% of patients over 70. From 2011-2013, 88 cases met inclusion criteria (mean age 70.7, SD 8.9, range 51-97). RT utilization was as follows: HF WBRT in 52%, conventional WBRT in 18%, and BT in 3% of cases. Of the 16 traditional schedule WBRT cases, 5 had perceived contraindications to HF WBRT, and 6 patients chose traditional over HF schedules. RT was omitted in 26% of cases (mean age 78.5, SD 7.4, range 61-97) and 44% of patients over 70. All WBRT was 3DCRT. No cases used IMRT. Conclusion: Among select early stage breast cancer patients pursuing WBRT at our institution, HF rate increased from 19% in 2006-2008 to 74% in 2011-2013 with no IMRT. National HF rates in this population were 11% in 2008 and 35% in 2013 with 9% IMRT. RT omission in patients over 70 at our institution increased roughly two-fold between the two periods. Our data shows rapid uptake of new evidence, adherence to national recommendations, and cost-effective practices at our institution. If national HF rates matched our institutional rates, the healthcare system could save as much as $22.7 million each year."
"Nixon, A. J., et al.",1994,The relation between the surgery-radiotherapy interval and treatment outcome in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without systemic therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This analysis was performed to clarify the relationship between the surgery-radiotherapy interval and the risk of recurrence in patients treated with breast-conserving therapy for early stage invasive cancers. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively analyzed data from 653 patients with American Joint Commission on Cancer Stage I or II, pathologically node- negative breast cancer treated by breast-conserving therapy without adjuvant systemic therapy between 1968 and 1985. All patients received a dose of at least 60 Gy to the tumor bed. Two hundred and eighty-three patients started radiotherapy within 4 weeks of surgery, 308 started 5-8 weeks after surgery, and 54 started 9-12 weeks after surgery. Median follow-up in the 531 survivors was 100 months. Results: Pathologic features and treatment characteristics were well balanced between the groups with surgery- radiotherapy intervals of 0-4 weeks and 5-8 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of overall recurrence among patients starting radiotherapy 5-8 weeks after surgery compared with those treated within 4 weeks. Analysis of the 5-year crude rates of failure further demonstrated no difference in the distribution of sites of failure in the 5- 8 week group compared with the 0-4 week group. A multivariate model controlling for known risk factors, as well as potential treatment-related confounders, also failed to demonstrate an increased risk of recurrence with the longer surgery-radiotherapy interval (risk ratio = 0.89, p = 0.44). Conclusion: This retrospective analysis suggests that a delay of up to 8 weeks in the interval between the last breast surgery and the start of radiotherapy is not associated with an increased risk of recurrence in patients with early stage breast cancer treated with breast irradiation to at least 60 Gy without systemic therapy."
"Noid, G., et al.",2017,Improvement of breast tumor delineation for preoperative radiation therapy using dual-energy CT.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We seek to amplify CT soft-tissue contrast between breast tumors and surrounding glandular tissue for radiation therapy (RT) planning and delivery guidance. The purpose of this work is to investigate the use of mono-energetic decompositions (MED) and dual energy indices (DEI) obtained from dual energy CT (DECT) to improve soft-tissue contrast, thus, breast tumor delineation for pre-operative RT. Purpose/Objective(s): DECT data acquired for a phantom and 6 early-stage breast cancer patients treated on a clinical trial of pre-operative accelerated partial breast RT was analyzed. Images were acquired during initial simulation and routine CT-guided RT delivery using an in-room CT scanner (Definition AS Open, Siemens Healthcare, Malvern, PA) equipped with a sequential DE protocol. The scanner rapidly performs two sequential acquisitions, the first at a tube voltage of 80 kV and the second at a tube voltage of 140 kV. MEDs across a range of energies from 40 keV to 190 keV were reconstructed using an image-based material decomposition approach that uses mutual information between the two scans. For each patient the gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated by the radiation oncologist. The CT number and its standard deviation for the GTV and surrounding tissue were measured across the spectrum of available mono-energies. A DEI was designed to separate the breast tissue into glandular and fatty tissue by using the CTNs of the healthy breasts from the two constituent scans of the DECT. The soft tissue inserts of a phantom (CTED/Gammex) enabled the definition of the physical density of the two tissue types and enabled a mapping from the CTN at 80 and 140 kVp to material composition. Results: Data from MEDs confirmed the expected enhancement of soft tissue contrast as the energy is decreased. At 120 keV the average contrast between the voxels in the GTV and the voxels in the surrounding tissue was 37 ± 10 HU. By decomposing the DECT data to 40 keV the contrast between the GTV and the surrounding tissue increased to 64 ± 20 HU, a contrast enhancement of 57% which was statistically significant (p =.02). The contrast to noise ratio (CNR) also increased for the lower energy mono-energetic images. 40 keV images had an average CNR of 1.24 while 120 keV images had a CNR of 1.14. The calculated mean mass density of the patient's GTV was 0.50 ± 0.21 g/cm3 while the surrounding tissue mean mass density was 0.88 ± 0.13 g/cm3. As a comparison, the tissue of the patients' untreated breast had a calculated mass density of 0.95± 0.10 g/cm3 and 0.98± 0.16 g/cm3for adipose tissue and glands, respectively. Conclusion: Low energy mono-energetic decompositions from DECT substantially increase soft tissue contrast enhancing the perspicuity of lesions relative to standard CT. This improvement in contrast could enhance the accuracy of target delineation for patients receiving pre-operative or definitive treatment for early stage breast cancer. The DEI of DECT create novel material density maps which may aid in identifying and characterizing tumors."
"Obeid, J. P., et al.",2015,Multiparametric evaluation of preoperative MRI in early-stage breast cancer: Prognostic impact of peritumoral fat.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Obesity is associated with adverse outcomes in breast cancer patients. Fat-specific cytokines (adipokines) have been proposed as key drivers of breast cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis. The current project aims at assessing the correlation between peritumoral fat and pathologic factors impacting radiation therapy recommendations. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed records of patients with early stage breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI as part of the work up prior to breast conserving therapy. Analysis of MRI studies was performed using commercially available software (MIM Vista Corp., Cleveland, OH). Tumor volumes were outlined on fat subtracted post-contrast image series under supervision of an experienced radiologist. The affected breast was contoured on a T1 weighted spin echo (SE) MRI sequence. Fat volumes were generated using a threshold set to the mean minus one standard deviation of the pixel intensities in the breast. Peritumoral region was defined as the intersection of a 1 cm spherical extension around the tumor and the breast contour. Surgical pathology records were used to extract relevant data as tumor grade, receptor status, lymphovascular space invasion and the ratio of positive axillary nodes. Univariate, multivariate and Pearson correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results: Among the 23 patients analyzed, 14 had T1 tumors and 9 had T2 tumors. Median age was 53 years ranging from 41 to 77 years. Tumor size (mean ± standard deviation) was 1.19±0.57 cm and 2.54±1.32 cm for T1 and T2, respectively (p<0.05). The ratio of total breast fat varied between 79 and 89% (median 86%) whereas peritumoral fat ratio varied between 25 and 90% (median 76%). Peritumoral fat content significantly correlated with the ratio of positive axillary lymph nodes (r=0.7, p<0.01). Furthermore, the distribution of pixel intensities in T2 tumors had significantly higher standard deviation than T1 tumors: 162 vs. 119 (p<0.05), suggesting a more heterogeneous texture for T2 tumors. Conclusion: Preoperative breast MRI can be utilized to predict extent of axillary disease. This work highlights a novel method for quantitating peritumoral fat content. In women with early stage breast cancer, peritumoral fat correlates positively with the ratio of pathologically involved axillary nodes."
"Obeid, J. P., et al.",2017,Multiparametric breast MRI analysis predicts axillary nodal involvement in early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast cancer remains to have a high mortality toll in women worldwide. Recently, there has been a surge in utilizing MRI in patients with breast cancer. Besides its classical utility in assessing tumor size and extent, breast MRI can be interrogated to derive various tumor related radiomics features. We hereby identify two novel radiomic features, namely peritumoral adipose density and voxel intensity gradient (VIG) flux, as non-invasive predictors of axillary nodal disease. Purpose/Objective(s): A retrospective cohort of 47 patients with early stage breast cancer was accrued. Pathology information and preoperative MRI exam, consisting of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE-) MRI, T1 Spin Echo and Gradient Echo sequences, were acquired. Tumor lesions were contoured using MIM imaging platform (MIM, Cleveland, Ohio). Peri-tumoral fat ratios were calculated within a 1 cm isotropic shell expansion of the lesion contours. The fat volume was isolated using a voxel intensity histogram standard deviation removed from the mean. This fat volume was normalized to the total shell volume yielding the ratio. VIG and VIG divergence, quantifying the VIG changes 2-dimensionally and measuring heterogeneity flux, were approximated at every tumor pixel and divergence structurally summed using Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). This measure of flux was normalized to tumor volume. Statistical multivariate analysis utilized Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients with leave-one-out cross validation. Results: Among the 47 patients analyzed, 33 had T1 tumors with size (1.02±0.48 cm) and 14 had T2 tumors (3.10±0.86 cm). Median age was 54 years ranging from 40 to 85 years. All analyzed patients surgically underwent either lumpectomy or mastectomy of the affected breast followed by radiation therapy. Both the peri-tumoral fat ratio and the normalized VIG divergence, measuring heterogeneity flux, independently demonstrated significant correlation with axillary nodal ratio of positive to number of nodes collected. A multivariate hybrid of both parameters generated the greatest correlative relationship. For a first-order multivariate polynomial, non-sentinel node ratio r=0.67 (p<0.001) and total node ratio r=0.54 (p<0.001). In nodal-positive patients r=0.75 (p<0.001) and r=0.68 (p<0.001), respectively. All mean squared errors were <0.05. Conclusion: Heterogeneity flux mechanistically exhibited correlation with axillary nodal involvement. This correlation is compounded with predictive capacity from peri-tumoral fat ratios and optimally displayed in patients with nodal positivity. This novel radiomic multivariable hybrid capable of characterizing intra-tumor and local environment features may be incorporated into future prognostic indices (nomograms) aimed at helping clinicians with axillary risk assessment non-invasively."
"Ogawa, Y., et al.",2012,"Non-surgical breast-conservation treatment (KORTUC-BCT) using a new image-guided, enzyme-targeted, and breast cancer stem cell-targeted radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC II) for patients with stage I or II breast cancer.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Tumor tissue can be re-oxygenated by inactivating peroxidase/catalase in the tumor tissue through the application of H2O2. This H2O2 is then degraded to produce oxygen. In this way, low-LET radioresistant tumors can be transformed into radiosensitive ones. The purpose of the present study was to establish a non-surgical BCT utilizing KORTUC II radiosensitization treatment. Materials/Methods: A new radiosensitizing agent containing 0.5% H2O2 and 0.83% sodium hyaluronate (a CD44 ligand) has been developed for intra-tumoral injection. This new method, named KORTUC II, was approved by our local ethics committee for the treatment of breast cancer. A total of 39 early-stage breast cancer patients (stage I, 12 patients; stage II, 27) were enrolled in the KORTUC II trial after providing fully informed consent. Mean age of the patients was 61.1 years. A maximum of 6 mL of the agent was injected into breast tumor tissue twice a week under US guidance, just prior to each administration of RT. The injection was started immediately prior to the 6th fraction of RT. Concerning RT, hypofractional RT was administered using a tangential fields approach and field-in-field method; the energy level was 4 MV and the total dose was 44 Gy administered as 2.75 Gy/fraction. An electron boost of 3 Gy was added three times just following the 14th, 15th, and 16th administrations of X-ray irradiation. From a needle biopsy specimen, hormonal status (estrogen and progesterone receptors), HER-2 antigen, and CD44 receptor status were examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Treatment was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects in all 39 patients. A total of 36 patients achieved cCR according to dynamic MRI, and the study has not yet been performed for the remaining 3 patients. No patients showed any significant complications (excluding mild dermatitis: Grade I, 24 patients; Grade II, 15 patients), and cosmetic results were excellent/good for 35 patients. Fifteen patients under 75 years old with stage II breast cancer underwent induction chemotherapy prior to KORTUC II treatment, and 36 patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors also received hormonal therapy following KORTUC II. The mean duration of follow-up as of the end of September 2011 was 30.1 months, at which time all 39 patients were alive without any distant metastases. Only 1 patient had local recurrence, which was discovered after 34 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Non-surgical KORTUC-BCT can be performed using KORTUC II, which has three major characteristics: image-guidance by US; enzyme-targeting of peroxidase/catalase; and targeting of breast cancer stem cells via the CD44 receptor. KORTUC-BCT offers great potential as a viable noninvasive replacement for surgical BCT."

A maximum of 6ml of the agent was injected into breast tumor tissue twice a week under ultrasound guidance. Concerning radiation therapy, hypofraction radiotherapy was given using a tangential field approach; energy level was 4MVand the total radiation therapy dose was 44 Gy administered as 2.75 Gy/ fraction. An electron boost of 3 Gy was added 3 times just following the 14th, 15th, and 16th administrations of 4 MV X-ray irradiation. From a needle biopsy specimen, CD44 receptor was also examined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Treatment was well tolerated with a minimum of adverse effects in all 40 patients. All of the patients achieved clinically complete response. The patients did not showany complications (with the exception of mild dermatitis), and cosmetic results were excellent for 36 patients. Patients under 75 years old with stage II breast cancer underwent systemic chemotherapy (EC and/or Taxan) prior to theKORTUCII treatment, and 32 patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors also undertook hormonal therapy followingKORTUCII. The mean follow-up period at the end of February 2011 was 28.6 months, at which time all 40 patients were alive without any distant metastases. Only 1 patient had local recurrence, which was discovered at 34 months follow-up. Conclusions: Non-surgical BCT can be performed with KORTUC II. KORTUC II has 3 major characteristics: it is image-guided by ultrasound, it employs enzyme-targeting, and it targets breast cancer stem cells via CD44. KORTUC II has great potential to become a valuable radiosensitizer for radioresistant neoplasms."
"Ognibene, G., et al.",2014,Three-dimensional conformal external beam accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate toxicity and corresponding dosimetric parameters for patients with early stage breast cancer treated with threedimensional conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CRT APBI). Materials/Methods: Patients ≥40 years of age with Stage 0, I or II breast cancer measuring ≥2.5 cm without lymph node involvement were eligible for enrollment. After undergoing lumpectomy with pathologically confirmed margins ≥2 mm, patients were treated with 38.5 Gy 3D-CRT delivered in 10 fractions over 5 consecutive days prescribed to the lumpectomy cavity + 10-15 mm margin. Patients were treated using respiratory gating. Medical records were reviewed to evaluate toxicity, including hyperpigmentation, breast edema, breast pain, telangiectasia, fibrosis, induration, rib fracture, fat necrosis, volume loss (hypoplasia) in the breast, and tenderness. Results: Between 5/04 and 9/13, 142 patients with 143 breast cancers (1 bilateral) were treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by 3D-CRT APBI. The median cavity, CTV, and breast volumes were 16.9 cm3 (range 1.6- 203), 75.1 cm3 (range 4.1 - 443), and 744 cm3 (range 150 - 3551) respectively. The median cavity/breast ratio was 2.6 (range 0.16-14). Twenty-six patients did not experience any toxicity from APBI. The remaining 116 patients experienced grade 1-2 radiation toxicities of tenderness (n=70), hyperpigmentation (n=62), and induration (n = 45). Conclusions: Although several studies report a high incidence of toxicity with 3D-CRT APBI, our results with reduced margins suggest that toxicity may be acceptable if there is careful attention to the volume of normal breast tissue that is irradiated. 3D-CRT APBI may therefore be a good option for patients if techniques allow for limited normal tissue toxicity."
"Ogo, E., et al.",2008,A Survey of Radiation-Induced Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia Syndrome After Breast-Conserving Therapy in Japan.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We observed a rare and unique occurrence of radiation-induced pulmonary injury outside the tangential field for early breast cancer treatment. The findings appeared to be idiopathic and were called radiation-induced bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) syndrome. We surveyed major hospitals in Japan to review their findings of radiation-induced BOOP, in particular the clinical and pictorial characteristics of the entity. Methods and Materials: We reviewed surveys completed and returned by 20 institutions. The survey responses were based on a total of 37 cases of BOOP syndrome. We also reviewed X-ray and computed tomography scans provided by these institutions. We discussed the information derived from the questionnaire and analyzed patients' characteristics, methods used in the treatment of BOOP syndrome, and prognosis. Results: The incidence of the radiation-induced BOOP syndrome was about 1.8% (37 of 2,056). We did not find a relationship between the characteristics of patients and the occurrence of radiation-induced BOOP syndrome. The pulmonary findings were classified into four patterns on chest computed tomography scans. Progression of the pulmonary lesions observed on chest X-ray was classified into three patterns. Pneumonitis appeared within 6 months after radiotherapy was completed and disappeared within 6-12 months after its onset. At 5-year follow-up, 2 patients had died, 1 of breast cancer and the other of interstitial pneumonitis, which seemed to be idiopathic and unrelated to the radiation-induced BOOP syndrome. Conclusions: Although the incidence of BOOP syndrome and its associated prognosis are not significant, the patients' clinical condition must be carefully followed.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Oguchi, M., et al.",2013,Radiation therapy for breast cancer after chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in an improvement in both disease-free and overall survival and is routinely administered for women with early stage breast cancer. However, combined treatment consisted with chemotherapy and radiation therapy is associated with both acute and long-term pulmonary complications. To investigate the acute toxicity of chest wall radiation therapy of breast cancer patients after chemotherapy induced pneumonitis. Materials/Methods: Between March 2005 to May 2011, 16 women suffering from chemotherapy induced pneumonitis were treated with standard postoperative radiation therapy. The retrospective analyze with medical chart review was carried out to identify the pulmonary toxicity after radiation therapy. The median follow -up time was 36 months. Results: The median age was 54 years old (range, 39-68 years). The chemotherapy induced pneumonitis, diagnosed with CT as diffuse interstitial ground glass opacity, was strongly related these regimens: DOC in 7 patients, PAC in 4, CAF in 3, and TC in 1. The major symptoms of chemotherapy induced pneumonitis were fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea and were treated successfully with supportive care and/or steroids. After confirming the remission of chemotherapy induced pneumonitis, 11 patients received whole breast irradiation (lung V20=3.6%) and 5 patients post-mastectomy radiation therapy (lung V20=15.5%). In all patients, radiation induced pneumonitis was scored Grade 0/1. Any other toxicity was not documented. Conclusions: The acute pulmonary toxicity of chest wall radiation therapy of breast cancer patients were acceptable, if radiation therapy initiated after confirming the remission of chemotherapy induced pneumonitis."
"Olivotto, I. A., et al.",1989,Late cosmetic outcome after conservative surgery and radiotherapy: Analysis of causes of cosmetic failure.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Although the majority of patients with early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy have acceptable cosmetic outcomes, the specific causes of a less-than-acceptable result are not well known. To assess the technical factors associated with late cosmetic failure, we reviewed the records of 593 patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy, Boston, between 1968 and 1981. Median follow-up was 76 months with a range of 37-186 months. Using a 4-point scoring system (excellent, good, fair, poor) patients were noted to have cosmetic 'failure' if scored as either fair or poor. Cosmetic results were similar at 3, 5, and 7 years with excellent or good scores seen in 88%, 90%, and 78% of patients, respectively. Three technical factors were associated with a significant worsening of the cosmetic results. The resection of 70 cm3 or more of breast tissue was more common among the failed patients than among matched patients with good or excellent results (p = 0.03). Eighty-nine percent of patients treated with a tangent pair technique had excellent results at 5 years compared to 69% of patients treated with a three-field technique (p = 0.004). The use of a larger volume implant was associated with a greater risk of a fair or poor cosmetic result compared to the use of a smaller volume implant. We conclude that overall cosmesis has been acceptable in this series, but there are technical (surgery and radiotherapy) factors which can be modified to optimize the cosmetic result without compromising local tumor control."
"Onal, C., et al.",2019,Dosimetric Comparison of Simultaneous-Integrated BOOST and Sequential BOOST with VMAT or Helical Tomotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients after Breast-Conserving Surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To perform dosimetric analysis of different breast simultaneous-integrated-boost (SIB) irradiation with respect to target coverage and organs at risk (OARs) doses, using volumetric-arc radiotherapy (VMAT) and helical tomotherapy (HT). Materials/Methods: The dosimetric analysis was performed in 30 early-stage breast cancer patients (15 patents right sided, 15 patients left sided breast) having breast conserving surgery. In SIB plan, the prescribed dose was 64.4 Gy to the PTVboost and 50.4 Gy to the PTVbreast in 28 fractions, and in sequential boost technique (SB) the prescribed dose was 50 Gy to PTVbreast and 16 Gy to PTVbreast delivered in 33 fractions. The target volume and OARs doses, conformity (CI) and homogeneity indices (HI) were compared between SIB and SB plans for both VMAT and HT plans. Results: For SB and SIB plans, the average maximum doses of PTV were significantly higher in VMAT plans than in HT (56.46±2.24 Gy vs. 53.21±0.92; p < 0.001 and 54.24±0.77 Gy vs. 51.80±0.71 Gy; p < 0.001, respectively). The maximum PTV doses were significantly higher in SB plan compared to SIB plan in both VMAT and HT plans. The CI was significantly higher in HT for SB plan (0.67±0.08 vs. 0.63±0.07; p < 0.001), however no significant difference was observed in SIB plan between VMAT and HT (0.67±0.09 vs. 0.65±0.08; p = 0.15). The CI in VMAT plan was better SIB plan compared to SB plan, however no significant difference was observed in HT. The HI was significantly higher in HT compared to VMAT for both SB and SIB plans (0.36±0.03 vs. 0.33±0.02; p = 0.001 and 0.32±0.04 vs. 0.30±0.02; p = 0.006, respectively). Lung V5 was significantly higher in VMAT compared to HT for SB plan (53.67±7.93 Gy vs. 43.73±7.25 Gy; p = 0.02). However, other dosimetric parameters for ipsilateral lung and heart did not differ significantly between each plan for VMAT and HT. The significant dosimetric advantage of contralateral lung V5 was found in HT compared to VMAT for SB plan (1.98±0.73 Gy vs. 3.52±1.40; p = 0.03). Although contralateral lung V5 was significantly lower in SIB plan compared to SB plan for HT (1.98±0.73 Gy vs. 1.61±1.06 Gy; p = 0.003), contralateral lung V5 was significantly higher in SIB plan for VMAT (4.04±3.22 Gy vs. 3.52±1.40 Gy; p = 0.04). Contralateral breast V5 was significantly lower in HT compared to VMAT for SB plan (1.48±1.19 Gy vs. 4.61±3.55 Gy; p = 0.03), however no significant difference was found for SIB plan between HT and VMAT (1.33±0.46 Gy vs. 1.82±0.77; p = 0.64). Conclusion: For breast irradiation after breast conserving surgery, HT is advantageous for lower maximum PTV doses, better conformity, and homogeneity in target volume doses compared to VMAT. Additionally, contralateral breast and lung doses were significantly lower in HT compared to VMAT. With SIB technique the target dose homogeneity and conformity was better, contralateral lung and breast doses were lower compared to SB technique. Our study demonstrated the dosimetric feasibility of SIB using HT for breast cancer patients."
"Ong, W. L., et al.",2019,Are We Choosing Wisely in Radiation Oncology Practice–Findings From an Australian Population-Based Study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the adoption of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists Choosing Wisely (CW) radiation oncology recommendations before and after the release of the recommendations. Methods and Materials: The Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Data Set captures details of radiation therapy delivered in the state of Victoria, Australia. This study included the following 3 groups of patients relevant to 3 of the 5 CW recommendations: women who received a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer at age ≥50 years who had breast radiation therapy (excluding nodal irradiation), patients with cancer who had palliative bone radiation therapy (excluding those with primary bone malignancies), and patients with cancer who had stereotactic radiation therapy to the brain (excluding those with primary malignancies of the central nervous system). The outcomes of interest were use of hypofractionated breast radiation therapy (<25 fractions), use of long-course palliative bone radiation therapy (>10 fractions), and use of adjuvant whole brain radiation therapy within 1 month of stereotactic radiation therapy. The Cochrane-Armitage test was used to evaluate changes in practice over time. Results: Among the 8204 patients who had breast radiation therapy, there was an increase in hypofractionation use from 42% in 2013 to 82% in 2017 (P <.001). The progressive increase in hypofractionation use was observed across institutions. Of the 15,634 courses of palliative bone radiation therapy delivered, only 1279 (8%) were >10 fractions, and this decreased from 10% in 2013 to 5% in 2017 (P <.001). Of the 1049 patients who received stereotactic radiation therapy for brain metastases, only 2% had adjuvant whole brain radiation therapy, and this decreased from 4% in 2013 to 0.7% in 2017 (P =.02). Conclusions: There was a significant change in radiation oncology practice in Australia between 2013 and 2017, in line with the CW recommendations. However, some of the recommendations need to be revised to reflect the rapidly evolving evidence in radiation oncology."
"Ong, W. L., et al.",2019,"Are We Choosing Wisely? - Pattern of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Use for Early Breast Cancer in Victoria, Australia from 2012 to 2017.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Level 1 evidence show non-inferiority of hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) compared to conventionally fractionated RT as part of breast conservation therapy in women with early breast cancer (BC). One of the Choosing Wisely recommendations in the US, Canada and Australia is: to not initiate breast RT without considering hypofractionation in this group of patients. However, remuneration for RT in the Australian healthcare setting is largely determined by fractions delivered. We aim to evaluate the adoption of hypofractionated RT for early BC and factors associated with that in Australia. Materials/Methods: This is a population-based cohort of patients with early BC who had breast RT (excluding patients who had nodal irradiation) as captured in the Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Data Set (VRMDS) between January 2012 and December 2017. The Cochrane-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate use of hypofractionation over time. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify patient-, sociodemographic-, and institutional factors associated with use of hypofractionation. Results: A total of 11,477 patients were included in the study. Overall, 6,490 (57%) patients had hypofractionated RT. There was significant increase in the use of hypofractionation from 36% in 2012 to 76% in 2017 (P<0.001). Older patients were more likely to have hypofractionation (mean age 64 vs. 56, P<0.001). Patients treated in private institutions were less likely to have hypofractionation compared to those treated in public institutions (50% vs. 62%, P<0.001). Patients treated in regional centers were also less likely to have hypofractionation, compared to those treated in metropolitan centers (50% vs. 58%, P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, increase in uptake of hypofractionation over time was independent of other covariates, with patients treated in 2017 8.2 times (95%CI=6.9-9.8, P<0.001) more likely to have hypofractionation compared to patients treated in 2012. Every year increase in age was associated with 8% (95%CI=7.3-8.2%, P<0.001) increased in likelihood of hypofractionation. Patients treated in private and regional institutions were less likely to have hypofractionation compared to patients treated in public (OR=36, 95%CI=0.33-0.40, P<0.001) and metropolitan institutions (OR=0.34, 95%CI=0.29-0.39, P<0.001) respectively. Conclusion: This is the largest population-based study on breast RT for early BC in Australia. We observed significant increase in uptake of hypofractionation over a 6-year period. There is, however, large geographical and institutional variation in uptake of hypofractionated breast RT, and further work is needed to reduce unwarranted variation in care for patients with early BC in line with the Choosing Wisely recommendation."
"Ott, O. J., et al.",2011,Accelerated partial breast irradiation with interstitial implants: Risk factors associated with increased local recurrence.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To analyze patient, disease, and treatment-related factors regarding their impact on local control after interstitial multicatheter accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Materials: Between November 2000 and April 2005, 274 patients with early breast cancer were recruited for the German-Austrian APBI Phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00392184). In all, 64% (175/274) of the patients received pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy and 36% (99/274) received high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Prescribed reference dose for HDR brachytherapy was 32 Gy in eight fractions of 4 Gy, twice daily. Prescribed reference dose in PDR brachytherapy was 49.8 Gy in 83 consecutive fractions of 0.6 Gy each hour. Total treatment time was 3 to 4 days. Results: The median follow-up time was 64 months (range, 9-110). The actuarial 5-year local recurrence free survival rate (5-year LRFS) was 97.7%. Comparing patients with an age <50 years (49/274) vs. ≥50 years (225/274), the 5-year LRFS resulted in 92.5% and 98.9% (exact p = 0.030; 99% confidence interval, 0.029-0.032), respectively. Antihormonal treatment (AHT) was not applied in 9% (24/274) of the study population. The 5-year LRFS was 99% and 84.9% (exact p = 0.0087; 99% confidence interval, 0.0079-0.0094) in favor of the patients who received AHT. Lobular histology (45/274) was not associated with worse local control compared with all other histologies (229/274). The 5-year LRFS rates were 97.6% and 97.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Local control at 5 years is excellent and comparable to therapeutic successes reported from corresponding whole-breast irradiation trials. Our data indicate that patients <50 years of age ought to be excluded from APBI protocols, and that patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer should definitely receive adjuvant AHT when interstitial multicatheter APBI is performed. Lobular histology need not be an exclusion criterion for future APBI trials.  Inc."
"Palazzi, M., et al.",2006,"Impact of radiotherapy technique on the outcome of early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery: A multicenter observational study on 1,176 patients.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To quantify the impact of radiotherapy technique on cosmetic outcome and on 5-year local control rate of early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant radiation. Methods and MaterialsPurpose: A total of 1,176 patients irradiated to the breast in 1997 were entered by eight centers into a prospective, observational study. Surgical procedure was quadrantectomy in 97% of patients, with axillary dissection performed in 96%; pT-stage was T1 in 81% and T2 in 19% of cases; pN-stage was N0 in 71%, N + (1-3) in 21%, and N + (>3) in 8% of cases. An immobilization device was used in 17% of patients; external contour-based and computed tomography-based treatment planning were performed in 20% and 72% of cases, respectively; 37% of patients were treated with a telecobalt unit and 63% with a linear accelerator; portal verification was used in 55% of patients; a boost dose to the tumor bed was delivered in 60% of cases. Results: With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, local, regional, and distant control rates at 5 years are 98%, 99%, and 92%, respectively. Use of less sophisticated treatment technique was associated with a less favorable cosmetic outcome. Local control was comparable between centers despite substantial technical differences. In a multivariate analysis including clinical and technical factors, only older age and prescription of medical adjuvant treatment significantly predicted for better local control, whereas use of portal verification was of borderline significance. Conclusions: Radiation technical factors impacted negatively on cosmetic outcome, but had relatively small effects on local control compared with other clinical factors.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Palta, M., et al.",2012,Use of adjuvant radiation therapy in elderly patients with early stage breast cancer: Changes in practice patterns after publication of cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB) 9343.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The CALGB 9343 randomized phase III trial established lumpectomy and adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen alone, rather than both radiation therapy and tamoxifen, as a reasonable treatment course for women over age 70 with clinical stage I, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was undertaken to assess practice patterns prior to and after the publication of this landmark study. Materials/Methods: The SEER database from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2008 was used to identify 47,985 women aged 70 or older treated with breast conserving surgery for clinical stage I, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Patients were split into those treated before the first publication of the CALGB 9343 data in 2004, and those treated after. A chi-square test was performed to compare administration of adjuvant radiation therapy in patients treated between the years 1990-2004 to patients treated during the 2005-2008 time period. Administration of radiation therapy was further assessed across age groups (70-74, 75-79, 80- 84 or 85+), tumor size (T1a, T1b or T1c), grade (1, 2 or 3), and laterality (right or left sided) for both time periods. Results: A total of 69.4% of patients treated between 1990-2004 compared to 61.7% of patients treated between 2005 and 2008 received some form of adjuvant radiation therapy (p < 0.001). There were significant reductions in the frequency of radiation therapy delivery across age groups (p < 0.001 for all age groups), tumor size (p < 0.001 for all tumor sizes), grade (p < 0.001 for all grades) and laterality (p < 0.001 for left and right) when comparing patients treated during 1990-2004 to patients treated during 2005-2008. Conclusions: Randomized phase III data supports the omission of adjuvant radiation therapy in elderly women with early stage breast cancer. Analysis of practice patterns before and after publication of this data indicates a significant decline in administration of adjuvant radiation therapy. A significant decrease in radiation therapy utilization was seen for all age groups, tumor sizes, grades, and tumor laterality."
"Panet-Raymond, V., et al.",2010,Pathological factors of the recurrent tumor predict outcome in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients with an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after treatment for early stage breast cancer have an increased risk of distant failure compared to those without IBTR. We set out to investigate the clinical significance of histopathological characteristics in the recurrent disease in a cohort of IBTR patients and explore their correlation with patient outcome. Materials/Methods: Among 6020 women with newly diagnosed, pT1-T2, pN0-1, M0 treated with breast conserving surgery and clear margins during 1989-1999, 289 had pathologically-confirmed IBTR. Cases with IBTR and simultaneous distant metastases (n = 20 cases) were excluded. Ten-year Kaplan-Meier Breast-Cancer Specific Survival (BCSS) and Overall Survival (OS) were analyzed in the remaining 269 patients according to patient, disease and treatment factors. Age at time of diagnosis and recurrence, time to IBTR, and IBTR factors including grade, histology, presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), estrogen receptor (ER) status, IBTR location relative to index lesion, extent of surgical resection, margin status, radiotherapy and systemic therapy use post-IBTR were investigated for their prognostic value. Endpoints were calculated from the date of IBTR. Multivariate analyses of invasive IBTR cases were performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: Median follow-up was 5.14 years (range, 0.2-16.9 yrs). The 10 year OS and BCSS post IBTR were 52.6% and 61.5%, respectively. Time to IBTR ≤72 months, LVI+, ER-, positive margins, grade III were significantly associated with diminished OS and BCSS on univariate analysis (all p<0.05). Use of systemic therapy and absence of definitive surgery at time of recurrence were associated with inferior OS and BCSS on univariate analysis (both p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, high grade (HR 1.91, p = 0.01), positive LVI (HR 2.59, p = 0.000), ER negative status (HR 2.01, p = 0.019) and time to IBTR ≤ 72 months (HR 1.92, p = 0.042) were significant predictors of diminished OS. When stratified according to number of prognostic factors (LVI+, ER-, grade III, time to recurrence ≤ 72 months), patients with no factors had a 10 year OS post IBTR of 57.5%. Conversely, those with 1 factor had an OS of 68.8%, those with 2 factors had an OS of 37.3% and 3 or more factors had an OS of 22.4% (all p = 0.000). Conclusions: Grade, LVI and ER status of the recurrent tumor and time to recurrence behave as independent prognostic factors, which influence outcome post IBTR. The presence of two or more of these features at time of recurrence is associated with a significantly diminished OS. These findings indicate that histopathological features related to the recurrence may help identify which patients may be best served by aggressive management post recurrence."
"Panet-Raymond, V., et al.",2011,True recurrence versus new primary: An analysis of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences after breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) can occur in 5-20% of women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Two entities of IBTR have been described: true recurrence (TR), suggested to be regrowth of disease at the tumor bed, and new primary (NP), distinct from the index lesion in histology and location. This study compared survival outcomes between two patient cohorts classified clinically as having either TR or NP. Methods and Materials: Between 1989 and 1999, 6,020 women were referred to the BC Cancer Agency with newly diagnosed pT1-2, N0-1, M0 invasive breast cancer, treated with breast-conserving surgery. Of these, 289 patients had pathologically confirmed IBTR. Retrospective analysis was performed, and a set of decision rules was applied to classify cases as TR or NP based on change in histology, grade, hormone receptor status, and tumor location. Of 289 patients, 129 (45%) were classified as having TR and 139 (48%) as having NP; 21 (7%) were unclassified. Results: The distributions of age at diagnosis, age at recurrence, and histopathologic factors were similar in the TR and NP cohorts (all p > 0.05). The mean time to recurrence was shorter in TR patients than in NP patients (4.8 years vs. 6.3 years, p = 0.001). Treatment of the IBTR did not differ between the two groups. In the TR and NP cohorts, breast cancer-specific survival was 55.7% vs. 61.3% (p = 0.93), and overall survival was 43.7% vs. 54.8% (p = 0.53). Conclusions: Time to recurrence is significantly shorter in patients with IBTR classified as true recurrence compared to new primary. Non-statistically significant trends for less favorable survival were observed for patients with TR. Further investigation of the hypothesis that TR and NP tumors are distinct entities with different survival prognoses will require standardized pathology review and molecular analyses.  Inc."
"Panzarella, T. and J. W. Meakin",1998,Analysis of cause-specific failure endpoints using simple proportions: An example from a randomized controlled clinical trial in early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To describe a statistically valid method for analyzing cause- specific failure data based on simple proportions, that is easy to understand and apply, and outline under what conditions its implementation is well- suited. Methods and Materials: In the comparison of treatment groups, time to first failure (in any site) was analyzed first, followed by an analysis of the pattern of first failure, preferably at the latest complete follow-up time common to each group. Results: A retrospective analysis of time to contralateral breast cancer in 777 early breast cancer patients was undertaken. Patients previously treated by mastectomy plus radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional nodal areas were randomized to receive further radiation and prednisone (R+P), radiation alone (R), or no further treatment (NT). Those randomized to R+P had a statistically significantly delayed time to first failure compared to the group randomized to NT (p = 0.0008). Patients randomized to R also experienced a delayed time to first failure compared to NT, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). At 14 years from the date of surgery (the latest common complete follow-up time) the distribution of first failures was statistically significantly different between R+P and NT (p = 0.005), but not between R and NT (p = 0.09). The contralateral breast cancer first failure rate at 14 years from surgery was 7.2% for NT, 4.6% for R, and 3.7% for R+P. The corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimates were 13.2%, 8.2%, and 5.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Analyzing cause-specific failure data using methods developed for survival endpoints is problematic. We encourage the use of the two-step analysis strategy described when, as in the example presented, competing causes of failure are not likely to be statistically independent, and when a treatment comparison at a single time-point is clinically relevant and feasible; that is, all patients have complete follow-up to this point."

R., et al.",2012,"Ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion: Prognostic implications, long-term outcomes, and role of axillary evaluation.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare the clinical-pathologic features and long-term outcomes for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) vs. DCIS with microinvasion (DCISM) treated with breast conservation therapy (BCT), to assess the impact of microinvasion. Patients and Methods: A total of 393 patients with DCIS/DCISM from our database were analyzed to assess differences in clinical-pathologic features and outcomes for the two cohorts. Results: The median follow-up was 8.94 years, and the mean age was 55.8 years for the entire group. The DCISM cohort was comprised of 72 of 393 patients (18.3%). Surgical evaluation of the axilla was performed in 58.3% (n = 42) of DCISM vs. 18.1% (n = 58) of DCIS, with only 1 of 42 DCISM (2.3%) vs. 0 of 58 DCIS with axillary metastasis. Surgical axillary evaluation was not an independent predictor of local-regional relapse (LRR), distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), or overall survival (OS) in Cox proportional hazards analysis (p > 0.05). For the DCIS vs. DCISM groups, respectively, the 10-year breast relapse-free survival was 89.0% vs. 90.7% (p = 0.36), DRFS was 98.5% vs. 97.9% (p = 0.78), and OS was 93.2% vs. 95.7% (p = 0.95). The presence of microinvasion did not correlate with LRR, age, presentation, race, family history, margin status, and use of adjuvant hormonal therapy (all p > 0.05). In univariate analysis, pathology (DCIS vs. DCISM) was not an independent predictor of LRR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-4.30; p = 0.36), DRFS (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.07-6.95; p = 0.77), or OS (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.28-3.82; p = 0.95). Conclusions: Our data imply that the natural history of DCISM closely resembles that of DCIS, with a low incidence of local-regional and distant failures. On the basis of our large dataset, the incidence of axillary metastasis in DCISM appears to be small and not appear to correlate to outcomes, and thus, microinvasion alone should not be the sole criterion for more aggressive treatment.

"Parikh, R. R., et al.",2010,Extent of axillary dissection predicts survival in pn0 early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recent data suggest that extensive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may have therapeutic benefits in terms of outcomes in node negative, early-stage breast cancer patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between the number of lymph nodes removed at ALND and survival for patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer who underwent conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS + RT). Materials/Methods: We reviewed a single-institution database of 2,478 patients and selected 970 patients who had pathologic N0 breast cancer treated with CS+RT between 1979 and 2003. The median follow-up time was 75 months. Patients were divided into two cohorts: 439 patients (45%) had < 12 lymph nodes removed on ALND and 531 patients (55%) had >12 lymph nodes removed. The association between the extent of ALND, clinico-pathologic markers, and outcomes were assessed in a multivariate model. The primary end points of local relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), and overall survival (OS) over 10 years were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazardsmodeling. Results: The extent of ALND was not significantly associated with T-stage, receptor status, race, family history, or adjuvant chemotherapy (all p >0.05). Patients who had < 12 nodes excised were more likely to receive adjuvant hormonal therapy (p<0.01). There were a total of 81 local relapses and 84 distant metastases in the study. The 10-year LRFS was 89% in the.12 group and 87% in the < 12 group (p = 0.87), while the 10-year DMFS was 87% in both cohorts (p = 0.28). Patients with >12 dissected lymph nodes had significantly better BCSS (p = 0.05, log-rank) and OS (p = 0.01, log-rank) than those with < 12 dissected lymph nodes. In a subset of patients receiving systemic therapy, BCSS and OS appeared to be unchanged in those patients with fewer nodes removed (p >0.05, log-rank). In subset analysis, node-negative patients who received systemic therapy did not have a higher local or distant relapse rate when fewer nodes were recovered. In multivariate analysis, the extent of ALND remained an independent predictor of worse BCSS (HR = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.59; p = 0.01) and OS (HR = 1.89; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.01; p = 0.007) at 10 years. Conclusions: In this large retrospective cohort of pN0 breast cancer patients treated with CS+RT in the pre-sentinel biopsy era, removal of >12 nodes was associated with better BCSS and OS than < 12 nodes on ALND. This may be attributed to understaging and undertreatment in patients with less extensive nodal dissections, challenging the rationale for “axillary sampling” or sentinel lymph node biopsy. The use of systemic therapy in these pN0 patients may override the prognostic implications of limited nodal dissection."
"Park, C. K., et al.",2012,Validating fiducial markers for image-guided radiation therapy for accelerated partial breast irradiation in early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may be beneficial for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The goal was to validate the use of intraparenchymal textured gold fiducials in patients receiving APBI. Methods and Materials: Twenty-six patients were enrolled on this prospective study that had three or four textured gold intraparenchymal fiducials placed at the periphery of the lumpectomy cavity and were treated with three-dimensional (3D) conformal APBI. Free-breathing four-dimensional computed tomography image sets were obtained pre- and posttreatment, as were daily online megavoltage (MV) orthogonal images. Intrafraction motion, variations in respiratory motion, and fiducial marker migration were calculated using the 3D coordinates of individual fiducials and a calculated center of mass (COM) of the fiducials. We also compared the relative position of the fiducial COM with the geometric center of the seroma. Results: There was less than 1 mm of intrafraction respiratory motion, variation in respiratory motion, or fiducial marker migration. The change in seroma position relative to the fiducial COM was 1 mm ± 1 mm. The average position of the geometric seroma relative to the fiducial COM pretreatment compared with posttreatment was 1 mm ± 1 mm. The largest daily variation in displacement when using bony landmark was in the anteroposterior direction and two standard deviations (SD) of this variation was 10 mm. The average variation in daily separation between the fiducial pairs from daily MV images was 3 mm ± 3 mm therefore 2 SD is 6 mm. Conclusion: Fiducial markers are stable throughout the course of APBI. Planning target volume margins when using bony landmarks should be 10 mm and can be reduced to 6 mm if using fiducials.  Inc."
"Park, H. S. M., et al.",2015,Postmastectomy radiation therapy for women with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes: Patterns of care analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The benefit of post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) for patients with 1-3 pathologically positive axillary lymph nodes (pN1a) following modified radical mastectomy (MRM) was demonstrated in the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis in 2005. The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that PMRT utilization has increased over time for pN1a patients and to evaluate clinical and non-clinical factors potentially responsible for variation in PMRT practice patterns. Materials/Methods: Using the National Cancer Data Base, we identified adult women diagnosed in 2003-2012 with pT1-2N1a invasive breast cancer as their first primary cancer, status-post unilateral MRM with negative surgical margins. PMRT was defined as postoperative radiation therapy to 40-66 Gy. Independent demographic, clinicopathologic, and healthcare system-related predictors of PMRT receipt were evaluated using the chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression modeling. Results: A total of 25,577 women were included, among whom 7,894 (30.9%) received PMRT. Median patient age was 57 years. The proportion of patients receiving PMRT increased significantly over time (24.0% in 2003 to 41.1% in 2011). Patients receiving PMRT were significantly more likely to be younger, have private insurance, reside in a wealthier zip code, have fewer comorbidities, have a larger primary tumor, receive chemotherapy, and receive hormonal therapy. There were no significant differences between groups in race, academic affiliation of reporting facility, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, number of lymph nodes examined, or breast reconstruction as part of the initial management plan. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that independent predictors of PMRT included diagnosis year after 2008 (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.75-1.96), age <60 (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.44-1.63), Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score 0 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.35), tumor size ≥2 cm (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.56- 1.78), chemotherapy receipt (OR 4.25, 95% CI 3.88-4.66), and hormonal therapy receipt (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.57-1.78) (all p<0.001). Conclusion: The utilization of PMRT for patients with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes has increased significantly in the past decade, even when excluding those with at least pT3 disease or positive margins. PMRT was more likely to be administered in those of younger age, lower comorbidity score, or in the setting of systemic therapy. Future research with long-term follow-up is needed to determine whether PMRT continues to be associated with a clinical benefit for pN1a patients in this era of modern systemic therapy."
"Park, S. S., et al.",2017,A novel delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation using intraoperative brachytherapy device placement and completion of breast conservation therapy within 10 days.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is a treatment option for early stage breast cancer. To improve patient compliance with adjuvant radiotherapy and decrease the total time for completion of breast conservation therapy (BCT), we initiated intraoperative catheter placement and starting brachytherapy within 2 weekdays. Purpose/Objective(s): From October 2012 to December 2016, 190 patients were prospectively evaluated and registered for intraoperative brachytherapy catheter placement. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 50 years, estrogen receptor positive invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in-situ, ≤ 2 cm on imaging, and negative surgical margins and sentinel lymph node (SLN) on intraoperative pathology. Target volume was defined as 1 cm of breast tissue beyond the cavity limited to exclude pectoralis, chest wall, and within 5 mm of skin surface. 3D planning was performed on CT images obtained on the weekday after surgery and treatment was initiated on the following weekday. The cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated considering death as a competing risk. Results: 170 patients (89%) had intraoperative catheter placement. 19 patients were registered but did not have catheter placed due to intraoperative findings (11 positive SLN, 5 extensive disease, 2 failed SLN mapping, 1 no residual disease). One patient had delayed positive SLN on permanent pathology and catheter was used to boost the cavity prior to converting to whole breast radiation. Prescription doses were 34 Gy in 10 BID (57%), 32 Gy in 8 BID (14%), and 21 Gy in 3 daily (29%) fractions. Median age was 67 and 9% were premenopausal. Median tumor size was 0.9 cm, 18% DCIS, and 6% grade 3. BCT was completed in a median of 9 days. Three patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and 64% had adjuvant endocrine therapy. Median follow up is 1.7 years (39% with at least 2 years), and 2-year local recurrence rate is 2%. Conclusion: Intraoperative pathology and brachytherapy catheter placement with initiation of APBI within 2 weekdays allows completion of BCT within 10 consecutive days in select patients with low short-term local recurrence rate. Long term follow up is planned for oncologic and cosmetic outcomes."
"Parker, J. J., et al.",2017,Risk factors for the development of acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Long-term follow-up of several large randomized trials of women with invasive breast cancer have shown breast conserving surgery followed by radiation was as effective as mastectomy without significant differences in survival. With adjuvant radiation though comes the risk of possible acute skin reactions, namely radiation dermatitis. We aimed to identify possible patient and treatment characteristics that may increase the risk of developing acute dermatitis. Understanding which factors are most highly associated with dermatitis could help individualize the prevention and management of radiation-induced skin toxicities in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment. Purpose/Objective(s): We analyzed 209 women with invasive and non-invasive breast cancer who received adjuvant radiation therapy for acute radiation dermatitis. We selected the following characteristics to evaluate their correlation: age, histology, tumor stage, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, breast position, whole breast fractionation schedule and dose, tumor bed boost dose, diuretics use, smoking status, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, chronic immunosuppression, and BMI. Univariate logistic regression was used to compare each factor across grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 dermatitis groups. Significant factors were then analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression. Results: On univariate analysis, the risk of grade 3 dermatitis increased for every 10 pounds increase over the grade 1 mean weight of 159.8 lbs (OR 1.13, p=0.02). In addition, for a 1 unit increase in BMI over 27.0, grade 3 dermatitis was more likely (OR 1.09, p=0.008). For every 100 cGy increase in whole breast dose over 4367 cGy, grades 2 and 3 dermatitis were more likely (OR 1.15 and 1.14, p=0.015. Total dose over 5818 cGy resulted in a higher risk of grade 2 and grade 3 dermatitis (OR 1.11 and 1.40, p=0.003). Age, smoking status, years smoked, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and chronic immunosuppression did not affect risk for development of dermatitis. On multivariate analysis, there was a higher risk of grade 2 (OR 1.07, p=0.024) and grade 3 dermatitis (OR 1.18, p=<0.001) with increasing BMI. Total dose also increased the risk of grade 2 (OR 1.13, p=0.007) and grade 3 dermatitis as well (OR 1.59, p=<0.001). Conclusion: Age, smoking status, years smoked, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, diabetes, autoimmune disease, and chronic immunosuppression were not significant risk factors within our patient population. BMI and dose are the most significant risk factors for the development of moderate and severe grades of dermatitis in the early and advanced invasive breast cancer patients examined."
"Pashtan, I. M., et al.",2012,External beam accelerated partial-breast irradiation using 32 Gy in 8 twice-daily fractions: 5-year results of a prospective study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: External beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an increasingly popular technique for treatment of patients with early stage breast cancer following breast-conserving surgery. Here we present 5-year results of a prospective trial. Methods and Materials: From October 2003 through November 2005, 98 evaluable patients with stage I breast cancer were enrolled in the first dose step (32 Gy delivered in 8 twice-daily fractions) of a prospective, multi-institutional, dose escalation clinical trial of 3-dimensional conformal external beam APBI (3D-APBI). Median age was 61 years; median tumor size was 0.8 cm; 89% of tumors were estrogen receptor positive; 10% had a triple-negative phenotype; and 1% had a HER-2-positive subtype. Median follow-up was 71 months (range, 2-88 months; interquartile range, 64-75 months). Results: Five patients developed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), for a 5-year actuarial IBTR rate of 5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-10%). Three of these cases occurred in patients with triple-negative disease and 2 in non-triple-negative patients, for 5-year actuarial IBTR rates of 33% (95% CI, 0%-57%) and 2% (95% CI, 0%-6%; P<.0001), respectively. On multivariable analysis, triple-negative phenotype was the only predictor of IBTR, with borderline statistical significance after adjusting for tumor grade (P=.0537). Conclusions: Overall outcomes were excellent, particularly for patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease. Patients in this study with triple-negative breast cancer had a significantly higher IBTR rate than patients with other receptor phenotypes when treated with 3D-APBI. Larger, prospective 3D-APBI clinical trials should continue to evaluate the effect of hormone receptor phenotype on IBTR rates.  Inc."
"Patel, M. A., et al.",2019,The Impact of Physician Productivity Metrics and Patient Tumor Biology on Receipt of RT in Elderly Patients with ER+ T1N0 Breast Cancer in a Tertiary Cancer Center.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Among elderly patients with early-stage invasive ER+ breast cancer, multiple randomized clinical trials show adjuvant radiation (RT) after lumpectomy does not reduce rates of survival or mastectomy (CALGB 9343, PRIME II). However, in the US, rates of adjuvant RT in this population have decreased modestly, from 79% to 75% (Soulos, JCO 2012). To understand barriers and facilitators to de-implementation of RT in these patients, we hypothesized that the enactment of a “new start” productivity metric for radiation oncologists would increase the rate of RT receipt among patients who were seen in consult by a radiation oncologist and/or increase the use of partial breast irradiation (PBI). Materials/Methods: We reviewed patients at a tertiary care center over the age of 70 treated with lumpectomy for ER+ pT1N0 from 2015-2018. A productivity metric based on number of “new starts” for patients treated with RT was implemented in January 2017; patients were divided into pre- and post- metric implementation for primary analysis. Chi squared analyses were performed to evaluate patterns of RT receipt before and after the new start metric. Secondarily, chi squared analyses and binary multivariate logistic regression including age, HER2 status, multifocality, and LVI were performed on all patients referred for RT to investigate biologic predictors of receipt of RT. Results: 501 patients met inclusion criteria, and 35% received adjuvant RT. 188 patients (37%) were not referred for RT consult and were excluded. Among 313 patients referred, the rate of RT was 55% prior to metric implementation versus 59% after (NS). There was no difference in RT use among high-volume or low-volume providers, or treatment at main campus versus the regional setting. There was no difference in use of PBI (20% vs 20%), hypofractionation (73% vs 71%), or conventional fractionation (1% vs 0%). Secondarily, univariate analysis of patients referred for RT trended toward LVI increasing rates of RT compared to no LVI (65% vs 53%, respectively, p=0.09); on multivariate analysis, only HER2 amplification was associated with receipt of RT (p=0.014). Review of physician notes indicated multifocality as a risk factor driving RT recommendation, but this was not consistent across providers. Conclusion: The implementation of productivity metrics did not significantly impact use of RT in a tertiary care center that is below the national average of RT use in elderly patients with early-stage ER+ breast cancer. Leadership priorities and centralized peer review may overshadow financial incentives in this context; these implementation strategies should be evaluated outside the tertiary setting. Secondarily, HER2 amplification, which was not available in the era of CALGB 9343, is infrequent (5%) but drives use of RT when present. With data suggesting favorable outcomes in early-stage ER+HER2+ patients, investigation of radiation de-escalation in this cohort is warranted."
"Patel, U., et al.",2010,"Placement and visualization of surgical clips in the lumpectomy cavity of patients with stage 0, i, and II breast cancer treated with breast Conserving Surgery and Radiation Therapy (BCS+RT).",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Surgical clips have been shown to assist in increasing the accuracy of seroma cavity delineation. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of surgical clip placement in the seroma cavity, cavity visualization score (CVS), and the cavity/clip assessment scale (CAS) in early stage breast cancer patients who underwent breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy (BCS+RT) at a single academic institution. Materials/Methods: Planning CT scans of 131 patients with Stage 0, I, and II breast cancer treated by a single radiation oncologist (BGH) between 2006-2009 who underwent BCS+RT were reviewed. For each patient, the seroma cavity was delineated, the number of surgical clips inside the cavity and the margins (anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, medial, and lateral) occupied by clips, and the corresponding CVS and CAS were recorded. Results: Of the 131 patients, only 58 (44%) of the seroma cavities had at least 1 surgical clip; of these 66% had 1-5 clips, 22% had 6-10 clips, and12%had.10 clips present (mean 5, median 4, range, 1-16). 53 (40%) had at least 1 margin occupied by a surgical clip; surgical clipswere found to occupy the anteriormargin in 28/53 (53%), posterior margin in 50/53 (94%), superior margin in 34/53 (64%), inferior margin in 25/53 (47%), medialmargin in 31/53 (58%), and the lateral margin in 25/53 (47%) of seroma cavities.Of these 22/53 (42%) had 1-3margins occupied and 31/53 (58%) had 4-6margins occupied (mean 3.7, median 4, range, 1-6). Themean CVS and CAS were 3.26 and 4.26, respectively. Surgical clips allowed a higher CAS score compared to CVS score in 29/53 (55%) of the seroma cavities with at least 1 margin occupied by a surgical clip. In these 29 cases, the average improvement of CAS over the CVS was 1.83. Conclusions: Placement of surgical clips in seroma cavities of patients undergoing BCT has not become common practice despite strong evidence supporting it. The CAS scoring system represents a modification to the CVS scoring system in that it accounts for the presence of surgical clips."
"Patni, N., et al.",2012,A comparison of acute and chronic toxicity profile between conventional and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the acute and chronic toxicity profile and locoregional control between conventional and hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) in early breast cancer prospectively. Materials/Methods: The study was conducted from June 2008 to January 2010. Forty patients with early breast cancer who underwent BCS were planned for whole breast irradiation and were randomly assigned in two arms. Those in the standard arm (A) received 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Study arm (B) received 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Both arms received photon beam to the whole breast followed by electron or brachytherapy boost to tumor bed. Acute toxicity was assessed at and 7-10 days after the completion of RT. Chronic toxicity was assessed 6 months after completion of RT and at last follow up. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE version 3.0. Results: Median follow-up was 7 months (6-20 months) until the time of analysis. The most commonly observed acute toxicity was radiation dermatitis (84.4%), followed by breast pain (66.3%), breast edema (64%), and heat sensations (38.5%). Radiation dermatitis was seen slightly higher in arm B at both points of assessment (at completion of RT 90% vs. 78.95%, p = 0.608; at 7-10 days of RT-90% vs. 68.42% p = 0.204) but was not statistically significant. Acute breast pain was observed more frequently in arm B as compared to arm A (52.63% vs 80%, p = 0.141) just at the completion of RT, which became statistically significant in arm B at 7-10 days of completion of RT (57.89% vs. 95%, p = 0.018). After 6 months of treatment, breast pain was similar in both the arms. Breast edema and heat sensation were comparable at both points of assessment in both the fractionation schedules. We found that grade II and III radiation dermatitis and breast edema was significantly higher in patients whose irradiated volume was >1800cc3 (p ≤ 0.05) as compared to lesser volumes irrespective of fractionation. Chronic toxicity was evaluated for induration, arm edema, hyperpigmentation, breast pain, and telangiectasia. They were comparable in both arms. The locoregional control and disease free survival was 100% until the time of analysis. Conclusions: Evaluation in a larger group is recommended with longer follow up. However, there is a suggestion that like partial breast irradiation, hypofractionation is a feasible option in whole breast irradiation."
"Paul, A. G. and N. P. Amin",2015,Cosmetic and dosimetric outcomes of African American breast cancer patients treated with whole-breast hypofractionated radiation therapy (WB-HFRT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): WB-HFRT is an established treatment paradigm for early stage breast cancer patients (pts) with limited data on the cosmetic outcomes in African-American (AA) pts. We investigated the skin toxicity profile of AA pts treated with WB-HFRT and examined if prone-HFRT resulted in tolerable cosmetic and dosimetric outcomes in obese pts with large pendulous breasts who are traditionally not eligible for supine-HFRT due to higher chances of increased hot spots leading to increased skin toxicity. Materials/Methods: In this single institution retrospective study, we assessed radiation dermatitis (RD) and hyperpigmentation in Stage 0-II AA breast cancer pts s/p lumpectomy and adjuvant WB-HFRT: 42.56 Gy (266 cGy/fx) + 10-12.5 Gy (250 cGy/fx) boost. Weekly skin changes were prospectively collected on a customized assessment form. Pts were selected for either supine or prone position based on the size and pendulous nature of the involved breast. The student t-test and chi-square were used to compare distributions of dosimetric and clinical outcomes, respectively, between supine vs prone. Results: Sixty AA pts were treated with WB-HFRT between 07/2012 and 06/2014. Table 1 displays the patient characteristics, cosmetic outcomes and DVH characteristics between the supine and prone position. Prone pts had statistically significantly larger BMIs and treatment volumes than supine pts, yet statistically significantly lower lung and heart DVHs. Supine and prone pts had comparable levels of hot spots (V105%), grades 1-2 RD, hyperpigmentation, and breast pain with no grades 3-4 RD. Nipple darkening, skin rash, and breast swelling was reported in 47%, 12%, and 28% of all pts, respectively. Conclusion: WB-HFRT in AA pts results in minimal skin toxicities. Prone- HFRT is a safe and preferred method to treat obese AA pts who otherwise would not have been favorable candidates for supine-HFRT. (Table Presented)."
"Paulsson, A. K., et al.",2017,Radiotherapy utilization for women over 60 with early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) has been considered standard of care for early stage breast cancer (CA) since NSABP B-06. Recent studies, including CALGB 9343, PRIME II, and an exploratory analysis from the Toronto-British Columbia (TBC) trial, have called into question the relative benefit of RT for women of advanced age with favorable breast CA. The NCCN guidelines were updated in 2004 to reflect the CALGB findings, which suggest hormonal therapy (HT) alone is appropriate adjuvant therapy for select women with low risk CA. In this study we analyze our institutional experience with implementation of the updated guidelines over time. Purpose/Objective(s): We identified women ≥ 60 with invasive breast CA treated at our institution from 2000-2014 through an IRB-approved database. Women who met criteria for CALGB 9343, PRIME II or the very-low risk cohort identified in the TBC exploratory analysis of outcomes by molecular subtype (pT1, ER+, grade 1-2) were included. The latter cohort reflects those not included in CALGB or PRIME II on the basis of age. Exclusion criteria were incomplete staging, pure DCIS, treatment with mastectomy or chemotherapy, unknown HT use, ER-, HER2+, tumor > 3 cm, or LN+ disease. We evaluated factors that could impact the decision to omit RT including age, year of diagnosis, tumor size and grade. Results: 2649 women ≥ 60 were treated for breast CA from 2000-2014; 460 met criteria. Median follow-up was 79 months. 180 women met CALGB criteria, 314 met PRIME II criteria, and 148 women age 60-65 met the very-low risk cohort from the TBC analysis. Data was analyzed based on date of presentation to compare RT omission rates before/after the NCCN update and before/after the long term CALGB publication in 2013. LRR rates were 1.8, 1.9, 1.4 and 1.6% for the patients who received RT, and 2.5, 4, 3 and 0% for patients in which RT was omitted in the overall, CALGB, PRIME II, and TBC-like cohorts, respectively (p=0.22, NS). Pts with grade 1 or 2 CA were less likely to receive RT (p<0.05 CALGB), as were pts with tumors ≤1 cm (p=0.05). Of the 74% who received RT between 2000-2014, 12.6% of these pts received hypofractionation (HRT) and 15.8% were treated with PBI. These proportions were similar across sub-groups. Following the long-term update of the Canadian HRT trial in early 2010, 56% of pts receiving RT were treated with whole breast HRT in 2010-2014, compared to 42% from 2000-2009. Conclusion: Despite the marginal benefit in LC and lack of OS benefit for women with low risk breast CA, many women ≥ 60 are still receiving RT as part of their BCT. While we observed a slight improvement in the use of HRT and the omission of RT over time, there remains a fundamental need to individualize breast CA care based on clinical/molecular characteristics and be prudent about utilizing healthcare resources."

Materials/Methods: Between 9/2010 and 5/2011, 50 consecutive breast cancer patients were submitted to adjuvant radiation therapy with SIBVMAT by RapidArc. Three out of 50 were irradiated bilaterally. All patients were enrolled in a phase I-II trial approved by the ICH ethical committee. The median age of the population was 68 years. According to AJCC staging system, 38 breast lesions were classified as T1, and 15 as T2; considering N stage, 50 were assessed as N0, 3 as N1. All 50 patients enrolled in the study underwent VMAT-SIB technique to irradiate whole breast with concomitant boost irradiation of surgical bed. Doses to whole breast and surgical bed were 40.5 Gy and 48 Gy respectively, delivered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. According to RTOG acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria, skin toxicities were recorded during and after treatment with a minimum follow-up of 90 days. Cosmesis outcomes were assessed by cosmesis forms to RTOG Headquarters. Results: The minimum follow-up was 6 months. The maximum acute skin toxicity by the end of treatment were: Grade 0 in 20/53 (38%) cases, Grade 1 in 32/53 (60%), Grade 2 in 0 and Grade 3 in 1/53 (2%) (1 of the 3 cases of bilateral breast irradiation). No G4 toxicities were recorded. After radiation, all Grade 1 toxicities have been resolved by 3 weeks. With respect to cosmesis, at clinical evaluation there were no significant differences in baseline vs. 90 days after the treatment, according to cosmetic scores. Conclusions: This 3-week course of postoperative radiation using VMAT with SIB has shown to be feasible and it was associated with acceptable acute skin toxicity profile. Long-term follow-up data are needed to assess late toxicity and clinical outcomes."
"Perera, F.",1995,Method of localization and implantation of the lumpectomy site for high dose rate brachytherapy after conservative surgery for T1 and T2 breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This article describes our technique of localization and implantation of the lumpectomy site of patients with T1 and T2 breast cancer. Our method was developed as part of our Phase I/II pilot study of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy alone after conservative surgery for early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: In March 1992, we started a pilot study of HDR brachytherapy to the lumpectomy site as the sole radiotherapy after conservative surgery for clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer. Initially, the protocol required intraoperative placement of the interstitial needles at the time of definitive surgery to the breast. The protocol was then generalized to allow the implantation of the lumpectomy site after definitive surgery to the breast, either at the time of subsequent axillary nodal dissection or postoperatively. To date, five patients have been implanted intraoperatively at the time of definitive breast surgery. Twelve patients were implanted after definitive breast surgery, with 7 patients being done at the time of axillary nodal dissection and 5 patients postoperatively. We devised a method of accurately localizing and implanting the lumpectomy site after definitive breast surgery. The method relies on the previous placement of surgical clips by the referring surgeon to mark the lumpectomy site. For each patient, a breast mold is made with radio-opaque angiocatheters taped onto the mold in the supero-inferior direction. A planning CT scan is then obtained through the lumpectomy site. The volume of the lumpectomy site, the number of implant planes necessary, and the orientation of the implants are then determined from the CT scan. The angiocatheters provide a reference grid on the CT films to locate the entry and exit points of the interstitial needles on the plastic mold. The entry and exit points for reference needles are then transferred onto the patient's skin enabling implantation of the lumpectomy site. Needle positions with respect to the lumpectomy site are then verified using simulator radiographs. Results: Eight double plane implants and four single plane implants have been done using this method. Five implants were done using direct visualization. It has not been necessary to reorient the implant in any of the patients. If not for the presence of surgical clips, the size of the lumpectomy site cannot be separated from the surrounding normal breast tissue. Conclusion: This technique is an accurate way to localize the lumpectomy site for HDR brachytherapy."
"Perera, F., et al.",2005,TLD skin dose measurements and acute and late effects after lumpectomy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy only for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This report examines the relationships between measured skin doses and the acute and late skin and soft tissue changes in a pilot study of lumpectomy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy only for breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Thirty-seven of 39 women enrolled in this pilot study of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (37.2 Gy in 10 fractions b.i.d.) each had thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) at 5 points on the skin of the breast overlying the implant volume. Skin changes at TLD dose points and fibrosis at the lumpectomy site were documented every 6 to 12 months posttreatment using a standardized physician-rated cosmesis questionnaire. The relationships between TLD dose and acute skin reaction, pigmentation, or telangiectasia at 5 years were analyzed using the GEE algorithm and the GENMOD procedure in the SAS statistical package. Fisher's exact test was used to determine whether there were any significant associations between acute skin reaction and late pigmentation or telangiectasia or between the volumes encompassed by various isodoses and fibrosis or fat necrosis. Results: The median TLD dose per fraction (185 dose points) multiplied by 10 was 9.2 Gy. In all 37 patients, acute skin reaction Grade 1 or higher was observed at 5.9% (6 of 102) of dose points receiving 10 Gy or less vs. 44.6% (37 of 83) of dose points receiving more than 10 Gy (p < 0.0001). In 25 patients at 60 months, 1.5% telangiectasia was seen at dose points receiving 10 Gy or less (1 of 69) vs. 18% (10 of 56) telangiectasia at dose points receiving more than 10 Gy (p = 0.004). Grade 1 or more pigmentation developed at 1.5% (1 of 69) of dose points receiving less than 10 Gy vs. 25% (14 of 56) of dose points receiving more than 10 Gy (p < 0.001). A Grade 1 or more acute skin reaction was also significantly associated with development of Grade 1 or more pigmentation or telangiectasia at 60 months. This association was most significant for acute reaction and telangiectasia directly over the lumpectomy site (p < 0.001). Grade 1 or more fibrosis, in 25 patients with a 60-month follow-up, occurred in 47.4% (9 of 19) of patients with a volume of 45 cm3 or less covered by the 100% isodose vs. 83.3% (5 of 6) of patients with a larger volume (p = 0.180). Asymptomatic and biopsy-proven fat necrosis occurred in 5 patients. No significant differences in fat necrosis rates according to volume were detected. Conclusions: For high-dose-rate brachytherapy to the lumpectomy site, TLD skin dose was significantly related to acute skin reaction and to pigmentation and telangiectasia at 60 months. An acute skin reaction was also significantly associated with the development of telangiectasia at 60 months. TLD skin dose measurement may allow modification of the brachytherapy implant geometry (dwell times and position) to minimize late skin toxicity.  Inc."
"Perera, F., et al.",2003,Patterns of breast recurrence in a pilot study of brachytherapy confined to the lumpectomy site for early breast cancer with six years' minimum follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: In this pilot study of high-dose-rate brachytherapy to the lumpectomy site as the sole radiation, ipsilateral and contralateral breast recurrences are documented with specific attention to the location of recurrence relative to the lumpectomy site. Methods: Between March 1992 and January 1996, 39 patients with T1 (32 patients) and T2 breast cancers received 37.2 Gy in 10 fractions (b.i.d.) over 1 week prescribed to a volume encompassing the surgical clips. Thirteen received adjuvant tamoxifen, and 4 received chemotherapy. Follow-up included annual bilateral mammograms and clinical breast examination every 3 to 6 months. Whereas 13 patients had intraoperative implantation of the lumpectomy site, 26 had postoperative implantation. The latter group and 7 of the former group had surgical clips marking the lumpectomy site, which allowed estimates of the distance of any ipsilateral breast recurrence from the lumpectomy site, using the mediolateral and cranio-caudad mammographic views. Results: At a median follow-up of 91 months, 33 women are alive, 4 have died of disease, and 2 have died of other causes. The 5-year actuarial rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence was 16.2%. Of 6 ipsilateral recurrences, 2 occurred within the lumpectomy site (in-field recurrences). One of the 2 patients had a 1-mm microscopic margin at initial diagnosis; the recurrence was a 3.5-mm microscopic focus of duct carcinoma in situ. The other patient had a 1.5-cm, high-grade infiltrating mammary carcinoma with no residual at wider resection at first diagnosis; the 5-mm invasive recurrence was also of high grade. Four women developed invasive recurrences at least 1.6 cm or more from the lumpectomy site (out-of-field recurrences). Two of these women had gross multifocal recurrences with two cancers in each patient; 1 of the 2 patients had an extensive intraductal component at initial diagnosis. The estimated nearest distances between the out-of-field recurrences and the surgical clips were 1.6, 5.5, 7.7, and 12.0 cm. All ipsilateral breast recurrences were salvaged by mastectomy (4 patients) or by repeat lumpectomy (2 patients) and whole-breast radiation. The interval postdiagnosis to ipsilateral recurrence ranged from 20 months to 58 months. There were two contralateral breast recurrences at intervals of 34 and 36 months; 1 of these patients also had a multifocal, ipsilateral recurrence at 58 months, as previously described. Among patients with any breast recurrence, 1 patient had a family history of prostate cancer; there was no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Of 17 patients who received adjuvant systemic therapy, only 1 had a breast recurrence. Conclusions: In this pilot study, breast recurrences outside of the lumpectomy site were the predominant pattern of recurrence.  Inc."
"Pernin, V., et al.",2013,Early and late toxicity of adjuvant radiation therapy associated with concurrent bevacizumab in patients with breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Even if bevacizumab is not approved for the treatment of early breast cancer (BC), few data are available regarding the safety of the concurrent combination of bevacizumab with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), especially in terms of late toxicity. The aim of this study was to determine early and late loco-regional toxicity among patients with non-metastatic BC treated with this combination in several clinical trials. Materials/Methods: In our multicenter prospective study, we analyzed toxicities of adjuvant RT in patients with non-metastatic BC receiving concurrent bevacizumab in several clinical trials. Early and late toxicities were assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v3.0). Evaluation was done during RT and 12 months after the end of RT. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. Results: From October 2007 to August 2010, 65 women with BC receiving concurrent bevacizumab with adjuvant RT were enrolled in our study. Median follow-up was 21.5 months (range, 1.4-46.8 months). Evaluation at 12 months was available for 62 patients. Mean age was 51 years. Among tumors, 6% were luminal BC, 24% HER2+ and 70% triple negative. A total of 55 patients had an invasive ductal carcinoma. Eighteen patients were stage I (29%), 21 patients stage II (34%), and 22 patients stage IIIB (35%) without patients stage IV (no data for one patient). A total of 23 patients (37%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus bevacizumab followed by surgery then RT, whereas 39 patients (63%) had surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy plus bevacizumab then RT. A total of 27 patients (44%) achieved post mastectomy RT and 35 patients (56%) had a whole breast RT with a boost in the surgical bed. Lymph node RT was performed in 42 patients (68%) with internal mammary chain RT in 25 patients (40%). Concurrent trastuzumab with RT and bevacizumab was performed in 14 patients (22%). Mean time of bevacizumab treatment was 10.2 months (range, 2-13 months) and mean total dose of bevacizumab was 15,085 mg (range, 960-28,080 mg). For patients with neoadjuvant bevacizumab, the mean interval between breast surgery and RT was 1.6 months (range, 1-4 months). Early dermatitis occurred in 48 patients: 56% grade 1, 35% grade 2, and 8% grade 3. Grade 2 esophagitis occurred in one patient. One year after the end of the RT, the most common late toxicities were grade 1-2 pain (11%), grade 1 arm lymphedema (6%), grade 2 arm lymphedema (2%), and grade 1 fibrosis (5%). No patients were identified to have grade ≥3 late toxicity. Two patients had cardiovascular events: one with a grade 1 arterial hypertension and one with a grade 1 ventricular extrasystoles. Conclusions: Our results indicate that concurrent bevacizumab with locoregional RT provide acceptable early and late toxicities after one year in patients with non-metastatic BC."
"Peschel, R. E., et al.",1993,"The effect of advanced age on the efficacy of radiation therapy for early breast cancer, local prostate cancer and grade III-IV gliomas.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: This study was undertaken to determine the effect of advanced age on radiation therapy outcomes for early breast cancer, local prostate cancer and Grade 3-4 gliomas of the brain. Methods and Materials: Radiation therapy outcomes for three malignancies (N = 1,401) were determined for a geriatric cancer population defined as 70 years of age or older and compared to a non- geriatric cancer population defined as less than 70 years of age. The three patient groups studied were: (a) primary breast cancer patients with clinical Stage I or II disease treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy (N = 994), (b) local prostate cancer patients with Stage A2, B, or C disease treated with radical radiation therapy (N = 294), and (c) patients with Grade 3-4 gliomas of the brain treated with high dose radiation therapy (N = 113). Results: For Stage I and II breast cancer, there was no statistically significant difference in the overall 10-year survival rates (63% vs. 73%), 10-year cause-specific disease-free survival rates (70% vs. 63%), and 10- year local breast recurrence free survival rates (76% vs. 79%) comparing the geriatric cancer population to the non-geriatric cancer population. For local prostate cancer, there was no statistically significant difference in the 10- year survival rates (38% vs. 41%) or in the 10-year cause-specific disease- free survival rates (58% vs. 52%) in the geriatric population compared with the non-geriatric population. On the other hand, the use of high dose radiation therapy for malignant gliomas resulted in statistically significant inferior 1-year (18% vs. 38%) and 2-year (0% vs. 10%) survival rates for the geriatric population versus the non-geriatric population. Conclusion: This study strongly supports the use of standard radiation therapy programs for early breast and prostate cancer patients age 70 years or more. However, our study raises questions about the efficacy of radiation therapy in patients over the age of 70 years with Grade 3-4 gliomas."
"Peterson, M. E., et al.",1999,Outcomes in breast cancer patients relative to margin status after treatment with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy: The University of Pennsylvania experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the significance of final microscopic resection margin status on treatment outcomes in women with early breast cancer who are treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation. Methods and Materials: An analysis was performed of 1021 consecutive women with clinical Stage I or II invasive carcinoma of the breast treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation. Complete gross excision of tumor was performed in all cases, and an axillary staging procedure was performed to determine pathologic axillary lymph node status. The 1021 patients were divided into four groups based on the final microscopic margin from the tumor excision or from the re-excision if performed. These four groups were: (a) 518 patients with negative margins; (b) 124 patients with focally positive margins; (c) 96 patients with focally close margins (≤ 2 mm); and (d) 283 patients with unknown margins. Results: Local failure was not significantly different in patients with negative, focally positive, focally close or unknown final pathologic margins of resection at 8 years (8% vs. 10% vs. 17% vs. 16%, respectively, p = 0.21). The 8-year outcome also was not different among the four groups for overall survival (86% vs. 83% vs. 88% vs. 81%, respectively, p = 0.13), cause- specific survival (89% vs. 86% vs. 88% vs. 83%, respectively, p = 0.14), no evidence of disease survival (81% vs. 73% vs. 86% vs. 77%, respectively, p = 0.09), and freedom from distant metastases (85% vs. 75% vs. 86% vs. 79%, respectively, p = 0.08). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that selected patients with focally positive or focally close microscopic resection margins can be treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation with 8-year local control rates and survival rates that are similar to those seen in breast-conservation patients with negative or unknown final resection margins."
"Pierce, L. J., et al.",2005,Conservative surgery and radiotherapy for stage I/II breast cancer using lung density correction: 10-year and 15-year results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) planning for breast cancer using lung density correction improves dose homogeneity. Its use obviates the need for a medial wedge, thus reducing scatter to the opposite breast. Although lung density correction is used at many centers in planning for early-stage breast cancer, long-term results of local control and survival have not been reported. Since 1984, we have used lung density correction for dose calculations at the University of Michigan. We now present our 10-year and 15-year results. Methods and Materials: The records of 867 patients with Stage I/II breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT with or without systemic therapy were reviewed. Tangential fields delivering 45-50 Gy to the whole breast calculated using lung density correction were used. A boost was added in 96.8% of patients for a total median dose of 61.8 Gy. Results: With a median follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 0.2-18.9 years), 5-, 10-, and 15-year actuarial rates of in-breast tumor recurrence as only first failure were 2.2%, 3.6%, and 5.4%, respectively. With surgical salvage, the 15-year cumulative rate of local control was 99.7%. Factors that significantly predicted for increased rate of local recurrence in multivariate analysis were age ≤ 35 years, hazard ratio 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-13.9) p = 0.004; negative progesterone receptor status, hazard ratio 6.8 (95% CI, 2.3-20.3) p = < 0.001; negative estrogen receptor status, hazard ratio 4.0 (95% CI, 1.5-11.1) p = 0.007; and lack of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, hazard ratio 7.7 (95% CI, 1.7-33.3) p = 0.008. Relapse-free survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 84.6%, 70.8%, and 55.9%, respectively; breast cancer-specific survival rates were 94.4%, 90.5%, and 86.9%, respectively; and corresponding estimates for overall survival were 89.7%, 75.7%, and 61.3%. Conclusions: Use of lung density correction was associated with high rates of local control, relapse-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival compared with other reported series of breast-conserving surgery and RT in early-stage disease. These results will serve as a benchmark against which newer radiation delivery strategies such as intensity-modulated RT and partial breast RT can be compared.  Inc."
"Pierce, L. J., et al.",1997,Conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer using a lung density correction: The University of Michigan experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Although an abundance of reports detail the successful use of definitive radiotherapy of the breast in the treatment in Stage I or II breast cancer, little data have been published concerning the use of lung density correction and its effect upon long-term outcome. As it has been the practice at the University of Michigan to routinely use lung density correction in the dose calculations to the breast, we retrospectively analyzed our results for local control, relapse-free, and overall survival. Methods and Materials: Clinical records were reviewed of 429 women with Stage I or II breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation with or without systemic chemo/hormonal therapy. Tangential radiotherapy fields delivering 45 to 50 Gy were used to treat the entire breast. A boost was delivered in 95% of cases for a total tumor bed dose of 60 to 66 Gy. All treatment plans were calculated using a lung density correction. Results: With a median follow up of 4.4 years, the 5-year actuarial rate of local control with local failure as the only site of first failure was 96% (95% CI 94-98%). Univariate analysis for local failure as only first failure found the following factors to statistically predict for increased risk of breast recurrence: young age (≤35 years old), premenopausal status, tumor size >2 cm, positive family history, and positive microscopic margins. Multivariate analysis revealed young age and margin status to be the only factors remaining significant for local failure. The 5- year actuarial relapse-free survival was 85% (95% CI 81-89%); overall survival at 5 years was 90% (95% CI 87-94%). Conclusions: Lung density correction results in rates of local control, disease-free, and overall survival at 5 years that compare favorably with series using noncorrected unit density calculations. While we will continue to update our results with increasing follow-up, our 5-year data indicate that the use of lung-density correction for dosimetric accuracy does not compromise local control."
"Pierce, S. M., et al.",1992,Long-term radiation complications following conservative surgery (CS) and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The frequency of brachial plexopathy, rib fracture, tissue necrosis, pericarditis, and second non-breast malignancies occurring in the treatment field among 1624 patients with early stage breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy between 1968 and 1985 is reported. The median follow-up time for survivors was 79 months (range 5-233 months). Brachial plexopathy was related to the use of a third field, the use of chemotherapy and the total dose to the axilla. Brachial plexopathy developed in 20 of 1117 women (1.8%) who received supraclavicular irradiation with or without axillary irradiation. The median time to its occurrence was 10.5 months (range 1.5-77 mo), and the majority (80%) of cases completely resolved. Among patients treated with a three-field technique, the incidence of brachial plexopathy was 1.3% (13/991) in patients treated with a dose to the axilla of ≤ 50 Gy, compared with 5.6% (7/126) in women treated with an axillary dose of > 50 Gy. The incidence of brachial plexopathy was 4.5% (15/330) among patients receiving chemotherapy, compared with 0.6% (5/787) when chemotherapy was not used (p < 0.0001). Rib fracture was seen in 29 patients (1.8%), at a median time of 12 months following treatment (range 1-57). In all cases, the rib fracture healed without intervention. The incidence of rib fracture was 2.2% (28/1300) among patients treated on a 4 MV linear accelerator, compared with 0.4% (1/276) for patients treated on a 6 or 8 MV machine (p = 0.05). Of patients treated on a 4 MV machine, 0.4% (1/279) developed a rib fracture when a whole breast dose of 45 Gy or less was given, 1.4% (10/725) after receiving between 45 and 50 Gy, and 5.7% (17/296) following 50 Gy or higher. Tissue necrosis requiring surgical correction developed in three patients (0.18%) 22, 25, and 114 months after treatment. Presumed pericarditis (requiring hospitalization) was seen in 0.4% of women (3/831) who received radiation therapy to the left breast 2, 2, and 11 months after the start of treatment. Three women (0.18%) developed sarcomas in the treatment field at 72, 107, and 110 months, for a 10-year actuarial rate of 0.8%. Two of these sarcomas developed in areas of probable match-line overlap. One patient (0.06%) developed an in-field basal cell carcinoma at 42 months. In conclusion, the risk of significant complications following conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer is low. Small alterations in treatment, such as using a 6 MV machine and limiting the dose to the whole breast and axilla to 50 Gy or lower, may reduce their occurrence."
"Pierquin, B., et al.",1980,Radical radiation therapy of breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The 5 year results of radical radiation therapy in operable, infiltrating breast cancer (T1, T2, T3; N0, N1a, N1b) in 177 patients are presented. The treatment protocol included a pre-radiotherapy tumorectomy for T1 and certain T2 tumors (those less than 3cm diameter). Patients with larger tumors were treated by radiotherapy alone. The treatment technique incorporated both conventional fractionated radiotherapy (60 Co and electrons) and endocurietherapy (192 Ir). At 5 years, the uncorrected, disease-free survival rates were 84% for T1, 79% for T2 and 56% for T3: loco-regional persistent or recurrent disease was seen in 4.5% of patients with T1 disease, 7.5% of those with T2, and 23% of T3 patients; 16 mastectomies had been performed. Of the patients with T1 and T2 disease, 95% had retained their breast and the esthetic result was judged to be good in 75%. We recommend this technique of radical radiotherapy in early breast cancer because of this high rate of tumor control, associated with a low rate of normal tissue damage and survival figures comparable to those achieved by radical surgery."
"Pignol, J., et al.",2011,Long-term results of adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation using permanent 103-palladium seed implants.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) technique has been evaluated prospectively for adjuvant Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI). For early stage breast cancer patients PBSI realizes the implantation of 103Pd stranded seeds using ultra-sound guidance and light sedation in a single one-hour session. This work reviews the long term clinical outcomes of three consecutive clinical trials assessing the treatment tolerance, feasibility and efficacy of this novel treatment. Materials/Methods: Since 2004 three clinical trials have been activated. The first Phase I/II trial accrued patients over 40 years with infiltrating ductal carcinoma # 3cm, initially less than 3 positive node then node negative, no LVI or EIC, margins clear ≥ 2mm. The second is a multicentre trial offered to patients over 50 years old with a DCIS#3cm and margins .3mm. The third is a multicentre Registry trial assessing the risk of serious adverse events. It is offered to patients with similar characteristics to the initial Phase I/II trial but age over 50. PBSI planning included a CT scan and an US to identify and delineate the target volumes. If the patient is deemed technically eligible, a brachytherapy plan is generated to deliver a dose of 90Gy on the minimal peripheral dose encompassing the planned target volume. Results: From May 2004 to March 2011, 98 patients have received PBSI. All patients but 3 experienced no significant pain at time of implantation. Acute skin side effects were graded using the NCI-CTC scale. The PBSI compared favorably to external beam radiation, with side effects peaking on the sixth week with 18.5% grade II acute skin reactions. Delayed toxicity measured 3 years after PBSI included indurations (7.7%), changes in pigmentation (4.6%), and grade I telangiectasia (20%). All of the patients declared being satisfied by the treatment. For the Phase I/II study, after a median FU of 62 months [range, 40 to 85 months] no patient had an ipsilateral breast recurrence. Two patients died of myocardial infarction, three patients had contra-lateral recurrence (one LABC and 2 DCIS), and one patient initially node positive had a regional recurrence. The cosmetic outcome as it relates to the radiation treatment was good or excellent in 97%. Using the RTOG scale, 98% of the patients declared being satisfied or very satisfied. Conclusions: Based on the long term prospective data, the efficacy, tolerance and acceptance of PBSI appears safe. This treatment presents several advantages over conventional radiotherapy and other forms of APBI, such as 3D-CRT or HDR brachytherapy, being delivered in a single one hour session and low dose rate brachytherapy. It requires however a careful patient selection."
"Pignol, J. P., et al.",2015,Report on the Clinical Outcomes of Permanent Breast Seed Implant for Early-Stage Breast Cancers.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Permanent breast seed implant is an accelerated partial breast irradiation technique realizing the insertion of 103Pd seeds in the seroma after lumpectomy. We report the 5-year efficacy and tolerance for a cohort, pooling patients from 3 clinical trials. Methods and Materials The trials accrued postmenopausal patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ 3 cm and clear surgical margins, who were node negative, and had a planning target volume <120 cm;bsupe. The outcomes included overall and disease-free survival and local and contralateral recurrence at 5 years. The true local recurrence rate was compared using 2-tailed paired t tests for estimates calculated using the Tufts University ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and Memorial Sloan Kettering ductal carcinoma in situ nomograms. Results The cohort included 134 patients, and the observed local recurrence rate at a median follow-up period of 63 months was 1.2% 1.2%, similar to the estimate for whole breast irradiation (P=.23), significantly better than for surgery alone (relative risk 0.27; P<.001), and significantly lower than contralateral recurrence (relative risk 0.33; P<.001). The 5-year overall survival rate was 97.4% 1.9%, and the disease-free survival rate was 96.4% 2.1%. At 2 months, 42% of the patients had erythema, 20% induration, and 16% moist desquamation. The rate of mainly grade 1 telangiectasia was 22.4% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The rate of asymptomatic induration was 23% at 2 years and 40% at 5 years. Conclusions The 5-year data suggest that permanent breast seed implantation is a safe accelerated partial breast irradiation option after lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer with a tolerance profile similar to that of whole breast irradiation."
"Pignol, J. P., et al.",2006,First report of a permanent breast 103Pd seed implant as adjuvant radiation treatment for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: A new technique of adjuvant partial breast irradiation using 103Pd permanent breast seed implants (PBSI) is presented. The procedure is performed in a single 1-hour session under local anesthesia. Methods and Materials: Patients referred to a single institution for adjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy for an infiltrating ductal carcinoma ≤3 cm in diameter, surgical margin <2 mm, no extensive in situ carcinoma, no lymphovascular invasion, and minimal or negative lymph node involvement were offered a PBSI. Results: Between May and December 2004, 31 eligible patients underwent CT scan and ultrasound simulations assessing PBSI feasibility. Fifteen were excluded because of feasibility issues, and 16 received PBSI. A minimal peripheral dose of 90 Gy was prescribed to the planning target volume corresponding to the clinical target volume identified on the CT scan plus a margin of 1 cm. The procedure was well tolerated; 56% of the patients reported no pain during the procedure, and 46% of the patients developed National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 1 acute reaction. None experienced toxicity Grade 2 or 3. Conclusions: Permanent breast seed implantation seems feasible and well tolerated on these preliminary clinical data and represents an ultimate step in the reduction of treatment fraction for partial breast irradiation.

"Pinnaro, P., et al.",2016,Short-course hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy after conservative surgery: A single-institution prospective study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): To assess the oncologic outcomes of an accelerated and hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (AH-WBI) schedule in which therapy was completed in 11 fractions over 3 weeks inclusive of a sequential boost. Materials/Methods: AH-WBI consisted of 34 Gy in 10 daily fractions over 2 weeks to the whole breast (3DCRT), followed by a single fraction of 8 Gy to the tumor bed after 1 week (electrons). After a pilot phase in which AH-WBI had been offered only to selected patients (2004-2006), this schedule has been offered to all patients operated conservatively for early breast cancer (pTis-2) at our Institution since 2008. Regional lymph nodes were not intentionally targeted. Primary endpoint is freedom from ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR); secondary endpoints include freedom from contralateral breast tumor recurrence (CBTR), from distant metastases (DM) and from second (non-breast) primary tumors. Progression free survival includes any of the above events as well as death due to intercurrent causes. Actuarial curves are computed with the Kaplan-Meier method since the last day of radiotherapy. Associations were explored at univariate analysis with the log rank test. Minimum follow up for living and event-free patients is 3 yrs; median follow up time of the whole analyzed patient population is 5.4 yrs (range: 1.8-11.4 yrs). Results: Two hundred fifty-one patients were analyzed. All patients underwent local excision of the primary tumor to negative margins. Of them, 52 (20.7%), 58 (23.2%), 67 (26.7%) and 44 (17.5%) patients were younger than 50 yrs, had tumors larger than 2 cm (pT2), had poorly differentiated tumors (G3), were nodal positive (pN+), respectively. Based on estrogen and progesterone receptor status, HER2 and ki67 (cut-off of 20%), cancer subtypes were as follows: luminal A, 147 pts (58.6%); luminal B-HER2 pos, 23 pts (9.2%); luminal B-HER2 neg, 24 pts (9.6%); HER2 pos, 21 pts (8.4%); basal, 23 pts (9.2%), undetermined, 13 pts (5.2%). Four patients failed in the ipsilateral breast after a median time of 3.2 yrs (range: 1.7-5.7 yrs) for a 5-yr IBTR-free survival of 98.7+0.7%. No clear trends or associations were detected between IBTR and age, grading, tumor subtype, pT or pN stage. Four patients developed distant metastases and, of them, 2 died of disease. Five-yr DM-free survival is 98.1 + 0.1%. Five patients developed a contralateral breast cancer, 4 infiltrative and 1 ductal carcinoma in situ after a median time of 3.8 yrs (range: 0.8-6.7 yrs). Five-yr CBRT-free survival is 98.7 + 0.7%. Thirteen patients developed a second primary tumor (which was lethal in 3) and 3 additional patients died of intercurrent disease. Five-yr overall and progression free survival are 96.7 + 1.3 and 91.6 + 1.9%, respectively. Conclusion: We demonstrated remarkably high local control rates with an 11-fx schedule irrespective of known adverse predictive factors."
"Pinnaro, P., et al.",2015,Impact of sequencing radiation therapy and chemotherapy on long-term local toxicity for early breast cancer: Results of a randomized study at 15-year follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare long-term late local toxicity after either concomitant or sequential chemoradiation therapy after breast conserving surgery. Materials/Methods: From 1997-2002, women aged 18-75 years who had (1) breast conserving surgery; (2) axillary dissection for early breast cancer; and (3) in whom 6-course CMF chemotherapy was planned, were randomized between concomitant (CONC) or sequential (SEQ) radiation therapy. Radiation therapy was delivered to the whole-breast through tangential fields to 50 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks, followed by an electron boost of 10 Gy (pT1) or 15 Gy (pT2) in 4-6 fractions to the tumor bed. Tamoxifen was prescribed to estrogen receptor-positive patients for 5 years. Surviving patients were tentatively contacted and examined from March 2014 -September 2014. Patients who had developed progressive disease or had undergone further breast surgery were excluded. Local toxicity was scored blindly to the treatment received. A logistic regression was run to investigate the effect of treatment sequence after correcting for several patient-related, treatment-related and tumor-related covariates on selected endpoints. The median time to cross sectional analysis was 15.7 yrs (range, 12.0-17.8 yrs). Results: Of 206 patients randomized, 154 (74.8%) were potentially eligible. Of them, 43 (27.9%) refused participation, 4 (2.6%) had been lost to follow-up and 5 (3.2%) we could not restore dosimetric data, leaving a final number of 102 analyzed pts. Regarding fibrosis of the treated breast (CTCAE v 4.0), 28 (27.5%) and 6 (5.9%) presented with grade 2 (GR2) and 3 (GR3) toxicity, respectively. At multivariate analysis (MVA), treatment sequence (CONC vs SEQ, OR: 4.05, 95% CI: 1.34-12.2, P = .013), tumor location (lower vs upper quadrants, P = .004), age (continuum, P = .015), electron boost energy (continuum, P = .006) were independent predictors of GR2-3 fibrosis. GR2-3 skin retractions (SOMA) were observed in 25 (24.5%) and 3 pts (2.9%), respectively. At MVA, treatment (CONC vs SEQ, OR: 3.87, 95% CI: 1.41-10.6, P = .008) and tumor location (P = .013) were independent predictors of GR2-3 retraction. About one quarter of the patients developed GR2-3 skin telangiectasia (SOMA), which was independently correlated to electron boost area (P = .013) and energy (P = .001), but not to treatment sequence. Only 6 pts (5.9%) developed GR1 SOMA edema of the breast precluding further analysis. Conclusion: At long-term follow-up, treatment sequence has an independent effect on both fibrosis and retraction with a 4-fold increase in the odds of GR2-3 toxicity."

Methods and Materials From 1997 to 2002, women aged 18 to 75 years who underwent breast-conserving surgery and axillary dissection for early breast cancer and in whom CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy was planned were randomized between concomitant and sequential radiation therapy. Radiation therapy was delivered to the whole breast through tangential fields to 50 Gy in 20 fractions over a period of 4 weeks, followed by an electron boost. Surviving patients were tentatively contacted and examined between March and September 2014. Patients in whom progressive disease had developed or who had undergone further breast surgery were excluded. Local toxicity (fibrosis, telangiectasia, and breast atrophy or retraction) was scored blindly to the treatment received. A logistic regression was run to investigate the effect of treatment sequence after correction for several patient-, treatment-, and tumor-related covariates on selected endpoints. The median time to cross-sectional analysis was 15.7 years (range, 12.0-17.8 years). Results Of 206 patients randomized, 154 (74.8%) were potentially eligible. Of these, 43 (27.9%) refused participation and 4 (2.6%) had been lost to follow-up, and for 5 (3.2%), we could not restore planning data; thus, the final number of analyzed patients was 102. No grade 4 toxicity had been observed, whereas the number of grade 3 toxicity events was low (<8%) for each item, allowing pooling of grade 2 and 3 events for further analysis. Treatment sequence (concomitant vs sequential) was an independent predictor of grade 2 or 3 fibrosis according to both the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (odds ratio [OR], 4.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-12.2; P=.013) and the SOMA (Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic) scale (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.19-11.79; P=.018), as well as grade 2 or 3 breast atrophy or retraction (OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.42-10.56; P=.008). No effect on telangiectasia was detected. Conclusions At long-term follow-up, concomitant chemoradiation therapy has a detrimental effect on both fibrosis and retraction with an approximately 4-fold increase in the odds of grade 2 or 3 toxicity."
"Pinnarò, P., et al.",2010,Accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy as adjuvant regimen after conserving surgery for early breast cancer: Report of toxicity after a minimum follow-up of 4 years.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the adverse effects of accelerated hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy (AHRT) after a minimum follow-up of 4 yrs. Materials/Methods: From October 2004 to March 2006, 39 consecutive patients (median age: 63 yrs -range, 47-81 yrs) with pTis, pT1-2, pN0-1 breast adenocarcinoma after conservative surgery were treated with an adjuvant AHRT consisting of 34 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 wks to the whole breast, followed, after 1 wk, by an electron boost dose of 8 Gy in a single fraction to the tumor bed. Skin and lung toxicity was evaluated daily during therapy, once a wk for one month after AHRT, every 3 mos for the first year and then every six mos. Lung toxicity was investigated in terms of CT density, pulmonary functional tests, and clinical and radiological scoring. The NCI CTC v.2 was used to assess the acute toxicity. The SOMA/LENT scoring system was used for the assessment of late sequelae. The NCI CTC v.4 was used to assess the lung toxicity based on pulmonary function tests. In 27 patients the skin thickness post-AHRT was evaluated on at least 4 years post-AHRT Ultrasound images. Paired t, chi-square and Wilcoxon tests were performed. KM curve was calculated to assess toxicity rate. Results: After a median follow-up of 55 mos (48-63 mos), all the patients are alive and local relapse-free. Three patients have a second tumor. Acute skin toxicity of grade 0, 1 and 2 was experienced by 49%, 41% and 10% of patients respectively; no patient experienced grade 3 or more. None of the patients showed any clinical signs of lung toxicity. No lung toxicity was detected 1 year post-RT, no variation of pulmonary density was observed. Statistically significant changes in lung toxicity > G2 and > G1 based on DLCO (p = 0.006 and p = 0.034, respectively) were detected when comparing data of patients who did/did not receive chemo-therapy, but no adjunctive effects were seen due to radiotherapy. These differences were lost both at 2-year post-AHRT. The skin thickness in the boost areas was higher in patients who received chemotherapy (p = 0.052). The G1 late skin toxicity rate was higher in patients who received chemotherapy (43% vs. 26%) but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.505). No > G2 late skin toxicity was observed. Barely palpable increased density of the treated breast was noted in 9/39 patients (in 2 patients this toxicity was limited to the boost area) and telangectasia (<1/cm2) limited to the boost area was evident in 2 out of 39 patients. The compliance with the treatment was excellent (100%). Conclusions: The AHRT investigated in this study is a feasible and safe treatment and does not lead to adjunctive acute and late toxicities."
"Pinn-Bingham, M. E., et al.",2011,Dosimetric parameters and clinical characteristics of early stage breast cancer patients treated with the SAVI breast brachytherapy device.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this retrospective study is to present our clinical experience and dosimetric parameters with Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) using the Strut-Adjusted Volume Implant (SAVI) applicator. Materials/Methods: Between June 2009 and January 2011, a total of 18 patients with 19 SAVI™ devices (one patient had bilateral implants) completed treatment at the University of California, Irvine (Orange, CA). Six patients had Stage 0, six Stage I, six Stage IIA, and one Stage IIIA disease. All patients were treated per guidelines specified in the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 protocol. Two patients were treated with the size 6-1 mini, seven with size 6-1, eleven with size 8-1, and one with size 10-1. Each treatment plan was evaluated for conformance of the dose to the PTV using the following dosimetric parameters: balloon/cavity volume, PTV volume, V90, V100, V150, V200 and skin dose. Results: Themedian agewas 55 years (range, 43-84 years).Most patients were postmenopausal (89%).Median tumor sizewas 1.15 cm (range, 0.01-3 cm). Tumors were positive for estrogen receptors in 68.4% of patients, progesterone receptor positive in 57.9%of patients, and Her2neu negative in 100% of reported patients. Ductal carcinoma in situ was present in 6 cancers (31.6%) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the remaining 68.4%. For all cases, the median cavity volume was 34.4 cc (min: 12.8 cc, max: 56.1 cc). The median PTV volume was 74.3 cc (min: 53.0 cc, max: 120.1 cc). For all cases, the median V90 was 98.9% (min: 96.0%, max: 100%). Themedian V100 was 93.8%(min: 87.9%, max: 98.8%). The median ofV150 was 33.2 cc (min: 22.4 cc,max: 46.7 cc). The median of V200 was 16.5 cc (min: 11.1 cc, max: 23.9 cc). The median skin dose was 86.5% (min: 53.2%, max: 137.1%). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the SAVI breast brachytherapy device allows great flexibility in sculpting the dose around the tumor volume while limiting the skin dose.We have achieved excellent dosimetry comparable to that reported in the literature. Future directions will include comparing dosimetric parameters to long-term clinical outcomes."
"Polgár, C., et al.",2007,Breast-Conserving Treatment With Partial or Whole Breast Irradiation for Low-Risk Invasive Breast Carcinoma-5-Year Results of a Randomized Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To report the 5-year results of a randomized study comparing the survival and cosmetic results of breast-conserving treatment with partial breast irradiation (PBI) or conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI). Methods and Materials: Between 1998 and 2004, 258 selected patients with T1 N0-1mi, Grade 1-2, nonlobular breast cancer without presence of extensive intraductal component and resected with negative margins were randomized after breast-conserving surgery to receive 50 Gy/25 fractions WBI (n = 130) or PBI (n = 128). The latter consisted of either 7 × 5.2 Gy high-dose-rate (HDR) multicatheter brachytherapy (BT; n = 88) or 50 Gy/25 fractions electron beam (EB) irradiation (n = 40). Results: At a median follow-up of 66 months, the 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 4.7% and 3.4% in the PBI and WBI arms, respectively (p = 0.50). There was no significant difference in the 5-year probability of overall survival (94.6% vs. 91.8%), cancer-specific survival (98.3% vs. 96.0%), and disease-free survival (88.3% vs. 90.3%). The rate of excellent to good cosmetic result was 77.6% in the PBI group (81.2% after HDR BT; 70.0% after EB) and 62.9% in the control group (52.2% after telecobalt; 65.6% after 6-9-MV photons; pWBI/PBI = 0.009). Conclusions: Partial breast irradiation using interstitial HDR implants or EB to deliver radiation to the tumor bed alone for a selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients produces 5-year results similar to those achieved with conventional WBI. Significantly better cosmetic outcome can be achieved with carefully designed HDR multicatheter implants compared with the outcome after WBI.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Popescu, C., et al.",2012,Simultaneous couch and gantry dynamic ARC rotation (C-G DARC) in the treatment of breast cancer with accelerated partial breast radiation therapy (APBRT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare the dosimetry of dynamic continuous couch arc rotation simultaneously with gantry rotation (C-G Darc) with 3 -dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in the treatment of early breast cancer with APBRT. Materials/Methods: In this study, C-G Darc plans were generated by using two tangential couch arcs with the same isocenter combined with a simultaneous non coplanar gantry rotation. The continuous dynamic couch arc was modeled by a series of consecutive IMRT fields at 10-degree intervals. The medial and lateral couch arcs were 60 and 50 degrees, respectively while gantry maximum arc rotation was 20 degrees. VMAT plans used a single partial arc (range, 200-240 degrees) with an average avoidance sector of 90 degrees to prevent direct beam exit into the thorax. The target dose was 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions delivered twice daily. C-G Darc andVMAT plans were compared with 3D-CRT in 20 patients previously treated with 3D-CRT (group A), and in 15 additional patients who failed the dosimetric constraints of the Canadian trial and of ASTRO for APBRT (group B). Normal tissue constraints difficult to achieve with 3D-CRT are a) ipsilateral breast V50% <60% for outer lesions and b) ipsilateral lung V10% <20% and contralateral breast maximum dose <5% of prescription dose for inner lesions. Two-sided paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: C-G Darc resulted in superior target coverage in all plans compared to 3D-CRT and VMAT (V95%: 98.2% vs. 97.1% and 95.7%). For outer breast lesions C-G Darc and VMAT significantly reduced the ipsilateral breast V50% by an absolute mean value of 8% in group A and 15% in group B (all p < 0.05), as compared with 3D-CRT. For inner and centrally located lesions, C-G Darc resulted in significant sparing of ipsilateral lung V10% when compared to 3D-CRT and VMAT (10.7% vs. 12.6% and 20.7% for group A and 15.1% vs. 25.2% and 27.3% for group B). In addition, similar advantage was observed in the dosimetry of contralateral breast where the percent maximum dose for C-G Darc, 3DCRT and VMAT were 3.9%, 6.3% and 5.8% for group A and 4.3%, 9.2% and 6.3% for group B (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: C-G Darc achieved superior target coverage while decreasing normal tissue dose as compared with 3D-CRT and VMAT, especially in patients who fail to achieve the ASTRO dose constraints using 3D-CRT. As a result, this technique has the potential of expanding the use of APBRT to patients currently ineligible for such treatment. Modification of the VMAT algorithm will be necessary to link couch and gantry rotation with variable dose rate and therefore, enable the use of C-G Darc in clinical practice."
"Póti, Z., et al.",2004,Partial breast irradiation with interstitial 60CO brachytherapy results in frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Evidence based on a 12-year follow-up of 70 patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To investigate the radiation-induced toxicity and cosmesis of brachytherapy (BT) alone in early stage breast cancer. Methods and materials A total of 70 women diagnosed with Stage I or II breast carcinoma participated in a BT study at the Municipal Oncoradiological Center, Uzsoki Hospital, Budapest, Hungary, between November 1987 and June 1992. They had undergone breast-conserving surgery with an unknown surgical margin. The postoperative tumor bed irradiation was performed with interstitial 60Co sources with an active length of 4 cm, with 10-mm center-to-center spacing arranged in a single plane. The median number of inserted sources was 5 (range, 2-8), with a linear activity of 133-137 MBq/cm at the beginning of the study. The 50 Gy delivered dose at 5 mm from the surface of the 60Co sources was administered during 10-22 h to the virtual postoperative lumpectomy cavity (i.e., plane). For radiobiologic considerations, the clinical target volume (CTV) was calculated retrospectively with a 10-mm safety margin, resulting in a 72-cm3 median CTV (range, 36-108 cm3) irradiated with a reference dose of 28 Gy. In the assessment of the skin and subcutaneous toxicity, the RTOG late radiation morbidity scoring system was applied. The radiosensitivity of the cultured fibroblasts was determined by clonogenic assay to check whether individual radiosensitivity played a role in the development and course of radiation-induced side-effects. Results The median follow-up was 12 years (range, 10-15 years). The population of the final study (34 cases) comprised all survivors with tumor-free breasts (27 cases) and patients with breasts erroneously ablated/excised for misinterpreted radiation-induced sequelae (7 patients). A total of 97% of the cohort (33/34) had grade ≥2, and 59% (20/34) had grade ≥3 radiation-induced toxicity. By the end of the follow-up, 85% of the patients experienced Grade ≥2 telangiectasis and 41% had Grade 3 telangiectasis. Eighty-eight percent had fibrosis of some form, and 35% had grade ≥3 fibrosis. Forty-one percent of the cohort displayed fat necrosis, which was always accompanied by Grade ≥3 fibrosis or telangiectasis. The cosmetic results were poor in 50% (17/34) of the patients. The radiosensitivity of the fibroblasts was increased in only 2/24 patients (8% of the investigated cases, in agreement with data published for the general population). Comparisons of our fibrosis prevalence data with those of others allowed an estimate of 0.47 h-1 for the rate of recovery of DNA damage in the fibroblasts. Conclusions Interstitial 60Co BT of the breast tumor bed alone with a limited CTV (median, 72 cm3) and a total dose of 28 Gy is associated with a high rate (59%) of grade ≥3 radiation-induced toxicity and a high rate (50%) of poor cosmetic outcome at the end of a median follow-up of 12 years. A relatively high BT dose rate (1.3-2.8 Gy/h) applied during a short overall treatment time (10-22 h) and a possible geographic miss (close to skin implantation) might have contributed to the development of these sequelae.

"Pötter, R., et al.",2007,Lumpectomy Plus Tamoxifen or Anastrozole With or Without Whole Breast Irradiation in Women With Favorable Early Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: In women with favorable early breast cancer treated by lumpectomy plus tamoxifen or anastrazole, it remains unclear whether whole breast radiotherapy is beneficial. Methods and Material: Between January 1996 and June 2004, the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) randomly assigned 869 women to receive breast radiotherapy ± boost (n = 414) or not (n = 417) after breast-conserving surgery (ABCSG Study 8A). Favorable early breast cancer was specified as tumor size <3 cm, Grading 1 or 2, negative lymph nodes, positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor status, and manageable by breast-conserving surgery. Breast radiotherapy was performed after lumpectomy with 2 tangential opposed breast fields with mean 50 Gy, plus boost in 71% of patients with mean 10 Gy, in a median of 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was local relapse-free survival; further endpoints were contralateral breast cancer, distant metastases, and disease-free and overall survival. The median follow-up was 53.8 months. Results: The mean age was 66 years. Overall, there were 21 local relapses, with 2 relapses in the radiotherapy group (5-y rate 0.4%) vs. 19 in the no-radiotherapy group (5.1%), respectively (p = 0.0001, hazard ratio 10.2). Overall relapses occurred in 30 patients, with 7 events in the radiotherapy group (5-y rate 2.1%) vs. 23 events in the no-radiotherapy group (6.1%) (p = 0.002, hazard ratio 3.5). No significant differences were found for distant metastases and overall survival. Conclusion: Breast radiotherapy ± boost in women with favorable early breast cancer after lumpectomy combined with tamoxifen/anastrazole leads to a significant reduction in local and overall relapse.

"Powell, S. N., et al.",2003,Risk of lymphedema after regional nodal irradiation with breast conservation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the risk factors for lymphedema in patients receiving breast conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Between 1982 and 1995, 727 Stage I-II breast cancer patients were treated with breast conservation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. A retrospective analysis of the development of persistent arm edema was performed. Lymphedema was defined as a >2-cm difference in forearm circumference compared with the untreated side. The median follow-up was 72 months. Breast and regional nodal irradiation (BRNI) was administered in 32% of the cases and breast irradiation alone in 68%. Results: Persistent arm lymphedema was documented in 21 patients. The 10-year actuarial incidence was 4.1%. The median time to edema was 39 months. The only significant risk factor for lymphedema was BRNI. The 10-year risk was 1.8% for breast irradiation alone vs. 8.9% for BRNI (p = 0.001). The extent of axillary dissection did not predict for lymphedema even within the subgroups of patients defined by the extent of irradiation. Most patients underwent Level I or II dissection. In this subgroup, the lymphedema risk at 10 years was 10.7% for BRNI vs. 1.0% for breast irradiation alone (p = 0.0003). Conclusion: Nodal irradiation was the only significant risk factor for arm lymphedema in patients receiving breast conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Our data suggest that this risk is low with Level I/II dissection and breast irradiation. However, even after the addition of radiotherapy to the axilla and supraclavicular fossa, the development of lymphedema was only 1 in 10, lower than generally recognized.  Science Inc."
"Prabhu, R. S., et al.",2010,Radiotherapy Implications for Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Skin Sparing vs. Non-skin Sparing Mastectomy following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) followed by immediate reconstruction for early stage breast cancer is a safe alternative to breast conserving therapy. However, its safety and efficacy in patients with locally advanced disease requiring adjuvant radiation (RT) remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of non-inflammatory stage III SSM vs. non-SSM women when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) and adjuvant RT. Materials/Methods: The records of 89 (34 SSM vs. 55 non-SSM) consecutive patients with stage III breast cancer who received anthracycline and/or taxane based NC, mastectomy, and adjuvant RT between 10/1997 and 03/2010 were reviewed. Median age at diagnosis was 48.5 years old (SSM) vs. 52 years old (non-SSM) (p = NS). There was no difference in the proportion (SSM vs. non- SSM) of Stage IIIA (76.5% vs. 67%), IIIB (8.8% vs. 20%), or IIIC (8.8% vs. 5.5%) patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 76% of SSM vs. 69% of non-SSM (p = 0.5) had tumors.5 cm, 94% vs. 91% were clinically node positive (p = 0.84), while 9% vs. 20% (p = 0.2) had T4b disease, respectively. Results: The median overall follow-up time was 25.3 months and was similar between groups. The time between surgery and RT did not differ based on surgery (median days 56 vs. 49, p = NS). SSM patients were as likely as non-SSM patients to begin RT within 8 weeks (52% vs. 67%, p = 0.2) or 12 weeks (82% vs. 88%, p = 0.4) of surgery. Surgical complications (most commonly infection) were significantly higher in the SSM group (27% vs. 4%, p = 0.001). By surgery type, the number of fat necrosis biopsies was not different (18% vs. 9%, p = 0.2) nor were the rates of pathologic complete response (pathCR) (21% vs. 18%, p = 0.5). The 2 year actuarial overall survival, breast cancer specific survival, and disease free survival for patients undergoing SSM vs. non-SSM were 85% vs. 79%, 90% vs. 81% and 79% vs. 79%, respectively (p = NS). Loco-regional relapse occurred in one non-SSM patient, while distant failure occurred in 6 (18%) SSM patients and 18 (33%) non-SSM patients (p = 0.12). Univariate analysis demonstrated that pathCR (p = 0.03) predicted for higher overall survival. Conclusions: This study is one of the largest series addressing outcomes and implications of SSM vs. non-SSM among women with locally advanced breast cancer. In our small study with limited follow-up, SSM does not appear to delay adjuvant RT, impair oncologic outcomes, nor lead to increased rates of biopsies for fat necrosis. Although surgical complication rates were significantly higher in SSM patients, this did not result in significant delays in adjuvant RT. Longer follow-up time is needed, but SSM appears to be a viable option for locally advanced breast cancer patients who achieve good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
"Prendergast, B., et al.",2009,The Dynamic Tumor Bed: Volumetric Changes in the Lumpectomy Cavity During Breast-Conserving Therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To characterize the magnitude of volume change in the postoperative tumor bed before and during radiotherapy, and to identify any factors associated with large volumetric change. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six consecutive patients with early-stage or preinvasive breast cancer underwent breast-conserving therapy at our institution between June 2006 and October 2007. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the breast were obtained shortly after surgery, before the start of radiotherapy (RT) for treatment planning, and, if applicable, before the tumor bed boost. Postoperative changes, seroma, and surgical clips were used to define the tumor bed through consensus agreement of 3 observers (B.P., D.I., and J.L.). Multiple variables were examined for correlation with volumetric change. Results: Between the first and last scan obtained (median time, 7.2 weeks), the tumor bed volume decreased at least 20% in 86% of patients (n = 31) and at least 50% in 64% of patients (n = 23). From the postoperative scan to the planning scan (median time, 3 weeks), the tumor bed volume decreased by an average of 49.9%, or approximately 2.1% per postoperative day. From planning scan to boost scan (median interval, 7 weeks), the median tumor bed volume decreased by 44.6%, at an average rate of 0.95% per postoperative day. No single factor was significantly associated with a change in tumor bed volume greater than 20%. Conclusions: The average postlumpectomy cavity undergoes dramatic volumetric change after surgery and continues this change during RT. The rate of change is inversely proportional to the duration from surgery. In this study no factors studied predicted large volumetric change.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Prior, P. W., et al.",2016,Dosimetric feasibility of preoperative partial breast irradiation in prone position using a magnetic resonance linear accelerator.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): The prone accelerated partial breast irradiation (pAPBI) using external beams is attractive since a higher dose can be delivered to a smaller volume of the breast in a shorter period of time in a position that maximizes normal tissue sparing and limits target motion. Current standard care of postoperative (postop) delivery of radiation therapy (RT) suffers from increased normal breast irradiation and inaccurate targeting. Delivery of RT in the preoperative (preop) setting would resolve these issues, particularly if MRI is used to guide the planning and delivery. This work studies the dosimetric benefits of delivering preop pAPBI with a MR-linear accelerator with a 1.5 T transverse magnetic field (TMF). Materials/Methods: MRI T2 STIR and CT data acquired both pre- and postoperatively in the prone position similar to the subsequent RT position for 4 patients with early-stage breast cancer using a 1.5 T scanner were used in this study. On each preop image set, the gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated, along with a clinical tumor volume (CTV: GTV plus 1.5-cm margin, a volume typically removed in lumpectomy and shown to correlate with microscopic extent beyond MR defined tumor), and the PTV (CTV plus 0.5 cm). Four dosimetric plans were generated for each case based on CT and MRI using a research system with a Monte Carlo dose engine to consider the effects of 1.5 T TMF. The 4 MRI- and CT-based plans were generated based on bulk electron density assignment based ICRU report 45. The 4 plans were: (1) single arc VMAT without TMF; (2) single arc VMAT with 1.5 T; (3) tangential VMAT with dual 50-60o degree arcs without TMF; and (4) tangential VMAT with dual 50-60o arcs with 1.5 T. Plans were also generated based on the patient's postop images used for their actual radiation treatment. Dose-volume constraints from the postoperative APBI NSABP B39/RTOG 0413 were used for all plans (prescription dose of 38.5 Gy). The skin was defined as the first 0.5-mm layer of tissue beneath. Results: The average preop/postop target (GTV for preop and lumpectomy cavity for postop) volumes were 5.7 (4.9-6.7) and 47.6 (8.9-153.5) mL, respectively. The average breast volumes for preop/postop images were 979.4 (835.8-1082.3) and 960.0 (756-1140.1) mL. The average breast volume receiving 34.65 and 19.25 Gy on T2- and CT-based, dual tangent plans without and with a 1.5 T TMF was found to be 18.52% vs 22.4% and 19.5% vs 20.1%, respectively. The average breast volume receiving 34.65 and 19.25 Gy on T2- and CT-based single arc plans without and with a 1.5T TMF was lower in magnitude and found to be 14.1% vs 18.1% and 14.7% vs 16.9%, respectively. The average skin dose to 1 mL was found to be 35.3 (30.5-38.3) Gy vs 36.2 (32.4-39.7) Gy for plans without and with a TMF. Conclusion: The MRI-guided preop pAPBI could potentially allow for treatment of a smaller volume of breast tissue, which could translate to lower rates of breast fibrosis and improved cosmetic outcomes. The presence of 1.5T has a small dosimetric effect on pAPBI."
"Pritz, J., et al.",2010,Validating fiducial markers for image guided radiation therapy for whole breast irradiation in early stage breast cancer treatment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) frequently uses intraparenchymal metallic fiducial markers as reference points in order to accurately and reproducibly treat a target volume position using daily image-guided localization. Prior breast studies have raised concerns about possible fiducial migration and motion. This study was conducted to determine whether textured gold fiducial markers positions in the breast parenchyma are sufficiently stable to be used for daily image-guidance in the treatment of breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Fifteen patients were enrolled on a prospective IRB-approved protocol and treated with tangential whole breast radiation using once daily fractionation. In each patient, 3 or 4 textured gold fiducials were placed in the breast parenchyma within a few centimeters of the tumor bed intraoperatively. Daily orthogonal imaging was performed to assess fiducial location, however daily patient set-up was not based on fiducial location but on conventional parameters (bony landmarks, tattoos, SSDs). Fiducial location measurements were made on the daily AP and lateral MV portal images. To assess fiducial migration, distances between fiducial pairs were calculated for each image set. Daily positional variability of the center of fiducial mass (COM) was assessed by measuring its distance from a reference vertebral body. One patient was excluded from the analysis of absolute motion due to poor image quality of the reference vertebral body. Results: For 95% of image sets, the variation in distance from fiducial COM to simulation isocenter was 0.72 cm or less. For all image sets the average change in distance was 0.44 cm (SD = +0.55 cm). The daily positional variability for fiducial COM relative to the reference vertebral body averaged 0.27 cm (SD = +0.23 cm). Change in distance (magnitude) between fiducial pairs averaged 0.19 cm (0.0 to 2.45 cm SD = +0.26 cm) and the distance between fiducial pairs varied by<0.6 cm in 95% of measurements. Due to the method of placing the fiducials further into the parenchyma than the tumor bed periphery, there was no significant directional motion consistent with involution of seroma though the course of treatment. Conclusions: The variation in distance between fiducial pairs was found to be small (average 0.19 cm). Textured fiducials were stable throughout the course of whole breast treatment with minimal migration, confirming the efficacy of fiducial use for breast IGRT. It was also found that without using fiducial-based daily IGRT localization, a PTV margin of at least 8 mm is required to account for set up variation and would be reduced to 4 mm if IGRT was employed for daily treatment setup."
"Qi, X., et al.",2015,Prediction of long-term clinical dose response for early-stage breast cancer using a dual-compartment mathematical model.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Growing evidence from recent cancer cell research and clinical data supports the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within solid tumors. Solid tumors including breast, lung, brain, etc. may comprise a small population of distinct heterogeneous population of CSCs, which exhibit more radioresistant than the differentiated tumor cancer cells (TCs). The objectives are to analyze the pooled published clinical outcome data from adjuvant breast radiation therapy, using a dualcompartment mathematical model to account for the heterogeneous radiosensitivity. Materials/Methods: A Poisson probability model based on a dualcompartment cell survival model was developed to calculate local disease- free survival rate (LDFSR) at follow-up times of 5- and 8- years. Clinical LDFSR data from a series of randomized clinical trials of earlystage breast radiation therapy (7806 pts) were included, including Whelan et al (1234 pts, Owen et al (1410 pts, two large randomized trials in the United Kingdom Standardization of Breast Radiation therapy (UK START) trial A (2236 patients. 9) and trial B (2215 pts. The prescription doses were between 39 and 50 Gy in 13-25 fractions. The evaluation cohorts using hypofractionation regimen of 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions (265 pts), including Ortholan et al and Courdi et al were used to validate the model prediction power. The fraction of breast CSCs (f) in total tumor cells and its radiosensitivity (αBCSC) were determined using the least square metric. Results: The model derived fitting parameters for breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) using the dual-compartment model are aBCSC=0.04 ±0.03 Gy-1, αBCSC ≈ 0, with the fraction of BCSCs f = 0.008 ±0.04, compared to the derived parameters for breast tumor cells (BTCs) using the single-compartment model: αBTC=0.11 ±0.03 Gy-1, α/β (BTC) =4.89 ±0.02 Gy. The dual-compartment model consistently yielded a small yet finite fraction of BCSCs, suggesting the existence of BCSCs after breast conservative surgery for early stage breast cancer patients. Both single- and dual-compartment model predictions agreed with the clinical dose-response points for patient cohorts receiving doses of 40 Gy or higher at 5- and 8-year follow-up time. Dual-compartment model more accurately predicted the testing cohorts receiving doses of <39 Gy than the single-compartment model, which underestimated the LDFSR. Conclusion: A dual-compartment radiobiological model, accounting for the level and radiosensitivity of the heterogeneous cancer stem cells, better predicted the pooled clinical outcome data than the standard singlecompartment model. The result suggests the importance of separate modeling the cancer stem cells in the dose response study."
"Qi, X. S., et al.",2010,Respiratory organ motion and dosimetric impact on breast and nodal irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To examine the respiratory motion for target and normal structures during whole breast and nodal irradiation and the resulting dosimetric impact. Methods and Materials: Four-dimensional CT data sets of 18 patients with early-stage breast cancer were analyzed retrospectively. A three-dimensional conformal dosimetric plan designed to irradiate the breast was generated on the basis of CT images at 20% respiratory phase (reference phase). The reference plans were copied to other respiratory phases at 0% (end of inspiration) and 50% (end of expiration) to simulate the effects of breathing motion on whole breast irradiation. Dose-volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose, and normal tissue complication probability were evaluated and compared. Results: Organ motion of up to 8.8 mm was observed during free breathing. A large lung centroid movement was typically associated with a large shift of other organs. The variation of planning target volume coverage during a free breathing cycle is generally within 1%-5% (17 of 18 patients) compared with the reference plan. However, up to 28% of V45 variation for the internal mammary nodes was observed. Interphase mean dose variations of 2.2%, 1.2%, and 1.4% were observed for planning target volume, ipsilateral lung, and heart, respectively. Dose variations for the axillary nodes and brachial plexus were minimal. Conclusions: The doses delivered to the target and normal structures are different from the planned dose based on the reference phase. During normal breathing, the dosimetric impact of respiratory motion is clinically insignificant with the exception of internal mammary nodes. However, noticeable degradation in dosimetric plan quality may be expected for the patients with large respiratory motion. Copyright  Inc. Printed in the USA. All rights reserved."
"Qiao, X., et al.",2015,Simultaneous integrated boost intensity modulated radiation therapy in early breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery: A prospective study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate prospectively the feasibility of simultaneous integrated boost intensity modulated radiation therapy (SIBIMRT) in early breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery. Materials/Methods: In this study, 87 stage I-II cancer patients after breastconserving surgery were prospectively collected from November 2007 to October 2014. All patents had received sentinel lymph biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. Usually 5 clips were placed around the surgical cavity. All patients were given SIB-IMRT. The dose of 4940 cGy and 5980 cGy were given to whole breast and tumor bed respectively in 26 fractions. The 11 patients (12.6%) with N1 after axillary lymph node dissection were given 5000 Gy/25 fractions in 5 weeks to the infraclavicular and supraclavicular areas in addition to whole breast irradiation. All 66 patients (75.8%) with positive ER and/or PR received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Sixty-two patients (71.3%) received adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. The grading of cosmetic evaluation was done before and after radiation therapy. Results: The median age was 45 years old (Range: 23-79). There were 47 patients with left breast cancer and 40 with right breast cancer, 69 patients with stage I and 18 patients with stage II. The median interval between surgery and radiation therapy was 63 days (Range: 15-159). The follow-up time was 43 months (Range: 5-86). The acute skin toxicity was 89.6% (78/ 87) in grade 1 and 10.3% (9/87) in grade 2 respectively. Seventy-six patients (87.4%) had excellent cosmetic result, 2 (6.9%) good appearance, 3 (3.4%) fair result and 2 (2.3%) with bad appearance. One of the two patients with bad cosmetic result received the breast reconstruction of the ipsilateral breast 3 years after breast-conserving surgery. One patient was dead duo to locoregional failure and distant metastases 11 months after surgery and 4 months after chemoradiation therapy. In addition, one patient died of car accident 5 years after radiation therapy without recurrence and metastasis. The 5-year overall survival was 98.5% and 5-year local/ regional control was 98.5%. Conclusion: SIB-IMRT is safe and feasible in early stage breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery and confers good cosmetic results and locoregional control."
"Rabinovitch, R., et al.",2008,Evaluation of Breast Sentinel Lymph Node Coverage by Standard Radiation Therapy Fields.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background: Biopsy of the breast sentinel lymph node (SLN) is now a standard staging procedure for early-stage invasive breast cancer. The anatomic location of the breast SLN and its relationship to standard radiation fields has not been described. Methods and Materials: A retrospective review of radiotherapy treatment planning data sets was performed in patients with breast cancer who had undergone SLN biopsy, and those with a surgical clip at the SLN biopsy site were identified. The location of the clip was evaluated relative to vertebral body level on an anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiograph, treated whole-breast tangential radiation fields, and standard axillary fields in 106 data sets meeting these criteria. Results: The breast SLN varied in vertebral body level position, ranging from T2 to T7 but most commonly opposite T4. The SLN clip was located below the base of the clavicle in 90%, and hence would be excluded from standard axillary radiotherapy fields where the inferior border is placed at this level. The clip was within the irradiated whole-breast tangent fields in 78%, beneath the superior-posterior corner multileaf collimators in 12%, and outside the tangent field borders in 10%. Conclusions: Standard axillary fields do not encompass the lymph nodes at highest risk of containing tumor in breast cancer patients. Elimination of the superior-posterior corner MLCs from the tangent field design would result in inclusion of the breast SLN in 90% of patients treated with standard whole-breast irradiation.  Inc.

"Rahimi, A., et al.",2017,Preliminary Results of a Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Trial for Early-Stage Breast Cancer Using 5-Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Partial-Breast Irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To evaluate the tolerability of a dose-escalated 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy for partial-breast irradiation (S-PBI) in treating early-stage breast cancer after partial mastectomy; the primary objective was to escalate dose utilizing a robotic stereotactic radiation system treating the lumpectomy cavity without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose. Methods and Materials Eligible patients included those with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive nonlobular epithelial histologies and stage 0, I, or II, with tumor size <3 cm. Patients and physicians completed baseline and subsequent cosmesis outcome questionnaires. Starting dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions and was escalated by 2.5 Gy total for each cohort to 40 Gy. Results In all, 75 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 62 years. Median follow-up for 5 cohorts was 49.9, 42.5, 25.7, 20.3, and 13.5 months, respectively. Only 3 grade 3 toxicities were experienced. There was 1 dose-limiting toxicity in the overall cohort. Ten patients experienced palpable fat necrosis (4 of which were symptomatic). Physicians scored cosmesis as excellent or good in 95.9%, 100%, 96.7%, and 100% at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after S-PBI, whereas patients scored the same periods as 86.5%, 97.1%, 95.1%, and 95.3%, respectively. The disagreement rates between MDs and patients during those periods were 9.4%, 2.9%, 1.6%, and 4.7%, respectively. There have been no recurrences or distant metastases. Conclusion Dose was escalated to the target dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions, with the occurrence of only 1 dose-limiting toxicity. Patients felt cosmetic results improved within the first year after surgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Our results show minimal toxicity with excellent cosmesis; however, further follow-up is warranted in future studies. This study is the first to show the safety, tolerability, feasibility, and cosmesis results of a 5-fraction dose-escalated S-PBI treatment for early-stage breast cancer in the adjuvant setting."
"Rahimi, A. S., et al.",2014,Phase 1 dose escalation trial using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for partial breast irradiation (PBI).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate tolerability of escalating doses of stereotactic body radiation therapy as partial breast irradiation (PBI) in treating early stage breast cancer after partial mastectomy. We conducted a phase 1 dose escalation trial testing 3 dose levels. The primary objective was to escalate the PBI dose utilizing a robotic stereotactic radiation system treating the lumpectomy cavity without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Eligible patients included DCIS or invasive nonlobular epithelial histologies, AJCC stage 0, I, or II with tumor size < 3cm, and margins ≥2 mm. Prior to simulation, 3-4 four gold fiducials were placed around the lumpectomy cavity for real-time respiratory tracking. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) equaled grade ≥3 toxicity by CTCAE (version 4) deemed definitely related to treatment for: skin, rib bone (fracture), pulmonary (radiation pneumonitis), or neurological (intercostal or brachial plexus nerves) or any grade 4 or 5 toxicity definitely attributed to therapy. Both patients and physicians completed baseline and subsequent cosmesis outcome questionnaires using a four point scale of - excellent, good, fair, and poor. Adjuvant endocrine or chemotherapy was permitted. Starting dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions. Dose was escalated by 2.5 Gy total provided four or fewer of 15 patients experienced a DLT within 90 days of treatment within each dose group. If more patients had DLT in a given dose cohort, the MTD would be exceeded. Results: Forty-five patients (15 per dose cohort) enrolled with median age 62 years. All patients had ER/PR+ and HER 2/neu- tumor profile. Median follow-up for cohort 1 - 25.2 months, cohort 2 - 18.6 months, and cohort 3 - 7.8 months. Seventy-three percent of patients received endocrine therapy and 0% chemotherapy. All 3 dose cohorts (30, 32.5, and 35 Gy in 5 fractions) completed 90 day follow-up without any DLTs, therefore MTD was never reached. There were 44 grade 1 toxicity events, 1 grade 2 toxicity (rib fracture), and no grade ≥3 toxicity. There have been no recurrences or distant metastases. Low grade dermatitis and breast pain increased with dose. Physicians scored cosmesis excellent or good in 93.1%, 100% and 100% (p = 0.26) respectively, at baseline, 6 and 12 months post SBRT, while patients scored the same periods 77.2%, 90.9% and 96.7% (p = 0.022). Conclusions: Dose was escalated to 35 Gy in 5 fractions without a DLT. Patients felt cosmetic results improved within the first year after surgery and SBRT. We are currently completing dose escalation for subsequent cohorts of 37.5 Gy and 40 Gy in 5 fractions PBI hoping to increase the likelihood of long term tumor control while evaluating toxicity and cosmesis of this technologically facilitated therapy."

"Rahimi, A. S., et al.",2019,Risk Factors for Fat Necrosis after Stereotactic Partial-Breast Irradiation (S-PBI) for Early-Stage Breast Cancer on a Phase I Clinical Trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We previously have shown a cutoff point of 124 cm3 or higher for PTV volume was predicted as yielding a higher probability of fat necrosis among all dose levels in early breast cancer patients treated with stereotactic partial breast irradiation (S-PBI) after lumpectomy. This study extends upon this previous work to define a predictive dosimetric factor for fat necrosis, which was experienced by a subset of patients. Materials/Methods: 75 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive non-lobular epithelial histologies and stage 0, I, or II, with tumor size <3 cm were enrolled in a dose escalation S-PBI trial between January 2011 and July 2015. Starting dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions and was escalated by 2.5 Gy total for each cohort to 40 Gy. Median age was 62 years. Median PTV size was 87.4 cm3 (range: 36-268.9cm3). Forty-two had invasive histology; 38.5% were grade 1, 51.2% were grade 2, and 9.3% grade 3. Patients and physicians completed blinded baseline and subsequent cosmetic outcome questionnaires. Fat necrosis was evaluated by clinical exam at each follow up. Results: With a median follow up of 62 months (9.2-79.6 months), eleven patients experienced palpable fat necrosis; five of the eleven were painful. The median time to the development of fat necrosis was 12.7 months (3-42 months). On univariate logistic regression, large ipsilateral breast volume was associated with the development of fat necrosis (P=0.007); receiving two treatments on consecutive days was associated with developing painful fat necrosis (P=0.02). Patients with larger breast and higher volume receiving greater than 45.0 Gy were prone to develop fat necrosis. For an increment of 100cc in ipsilateral breast volume, there was a 15% increase of having fat necrosis (odds ratio of 1.05). For an increment of 1cc breast treatment volume receiving 45.0 Gy, there was an 8% increase of having fat necrosis (odds ratio of 1.08). Breast laterality, location, tumor size, histology, race, smoking and diabetic status were not significantly associated with fat necrosis on univariate analysis. Conclusion: Early breast cancer patients receiving S-PBI on our Phase I study had an overall low rate of fat necrosis (14.6%) and lower symptomatic necrosis (6.9%). None required surgical intervention. Limiting S-PBI fractions to every other day may decrease the rate of painful fat necrosis development. Individualized dose constraints based on breast size are recommended. We are incorporating these findings in current and future breast S-PBI clinical trials to decrease the incidence of fat necrosis. As S-PBI gains popularity as a patient-friendly treatment option, future studies investigating underlying biological mechanisms are necessary to appropriately assess the risks, to prevent or decrease its prevalence and to remedy symptoms of fat necrosis."
"Rahman, Z., et al.",2016,Safely preserving the breast in patients with cardiac pacing devices.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Cardiac pacing devices (PD) become more prevalent each year but present major impediments to the breast preservation therapy preferred by the vast majority of women with early stage breast cancer. PDs and their complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies may be damaged by radiation, so traditional guidelines have recommended surgical PD relocation prior to breast preservation therapy or mastectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and subtotal whole breast radiation could be administered without inducing PD failure. Materials/Methods: Twenty consecutive patients with early stage breast cancer and PD were evaluated under the auspices of an institutional review board-approved protocol. All patients had been considered for mastectomy due to concerns of treatment-related device failure. Patients were offered breast conservation radiation therapy following lumpectomy using whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT), modified WBRT (mWBRT), intracavitary high dose rate brachytherapy (HBR), or 3-dimensional conformal accelerated external beam radiation therapy (3DCRT). Nine patients were treated with WBRT or mWBRT (4 right and 5 left), six with 3D-CRT, and five with HDR. All patients with left-sided lesions were treated with mWBRT which exempted the breast in the peridevice region from excessive radiation. Pre-treatment predictive planning was used to estimate dose to the device, and intrafractional electronic dosimetric measurements were taken of exposure of the device at the suspected maximal dose points. A pacemaker protocol was used to monitor function of the device prior to irradiation, during treatment, and post-therapy. Results: No PD received a cumulative dose in excess of 200 cGy. One patient treated with a linear accelerator had an asymptomatic acute recalibration of her pacemaker likely from CMOS interference by electromagnetic waves. The device representative on site immediately reset her device to specification and she has developed no issues to date. There have been no other device failures, or local recurrences to date at a mean follow up of 3 years. Conclusion: APBI and total/sub-total breast irradiation are safe and offer an alternative to device-mandated mastectomy or pacemaker relocation."

S., et al.",2014,Utilization of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer in the elderly population: A national cancer data base analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) following breast conserving surgery for early stage breast cancer is well-supported by the literature. The rate of HF-WBI utilization and associated patterns of care for the elderly population is not known and was the subject of this study. Materials/Methods: The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is a comprehensive database which captures 70% of all newly diagnosed cancer patients in the US. We utilized NCDB to identify women aged ≥70 diagnosed with T1N0/T1Nx invasive breast cancer or DCIS who underwent a lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast external beam radiation therapy. HF-WBI was defined when a definitive radiation dose (≥40 Gy) was delivered in ≤23 fractions. Univariate and multivariable exploratory analyses of factors associated with HF-WBI use were performed. Results: A total of 96,501 patients who met inclusion criteria were identified from 1998-2011. The commonest HF-WBI regimen was 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions. Adoption rate of HF-WBI was greatest for academic facilities where it was utilized in 36.2% of cases in 2011 compared to 17.5% and 25.3% of cases in community and comprehensive community facilities, respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that the factors associated with increased use of HF-WBI include (in order of association) are: later year of diagnosis, treatment in academic center, advancing age, residence in a higher income area, treatment in Mountain region, lower grade of disease, presence of invasive cancer, and greater distance from reporting facility. Notably, the patient's insurance, race, and Charlson/ Deyo comorbidity index were not associated with HF-WBI utilization. Conclusions: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to comprehensively assess the patterns of care associated with hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy in elderly women with early stage breast cancer in a national database. Although, HF-WBI is more cost-effective, offers greater convenience, and is supported by the highest level of evidence, these results reveal that it remains sub-optimally utilized. Strategies to identify and break barriers to the adoption of HF-WBI should be explored. (Table Presented)."
"Rakhra, S., et al.",2014,Review of outcomes after breast-conserving surgery and intraoperative radiation therapy and risk factors leading to breast complications for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate outcomes after breast conversing surgery and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) and risk factors leading to an increase in wound complications and/or fat necrosis for patients with early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Patients treated from January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2014 with early stage breast cancer with breast conserving surgery and IORT at our institution were included. Recurrences, wound complications, and/or fat necrosis were assessed at subsequent follow-up visits. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess risk factors leading to an increase in complication rates. Clinical exams and radiologic imaging was used to assess recurrence. Results: One hundred fourteen patients were identified with two undergoing bilateral treatment. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics are presented in table 1. Average length of time for IORT was 32 minutes 32 seconds (15:50-55:18). Six patients underwent additional surgery while 16 received external beam radiation (EBRT). Average follow-up was 11.7 months (0-32.8) for all patients. Nine patients were found to have wound complications while two had fat necrosis on follow-up. Of risk factors including age at the time of surgery (p=0.21), tumor size (p=0.85), age at last follow-up (p = 0.21), additional EBRT (p = 0.09), only applicator size (p < 0.01) showed a statistical significance increase in wound complications. There was one image detected and biopsy proven ipsilateral recurrence for which the patient elected to undergo a mastectomy. Conclusions: Applicator size was the only variable in our subset of patients which led to an increase in wound complications (7.7%) and fat necrosis (1.7%) following IORT for early stage breast cancer. IORT is a safe treatment for a select group of patients leading to a minimal increase in complication rates following lumpectomy. (Table Presented)."
"Rao, N., et al.",2014,"Can tangential fields designed for whole-breast coverage in early breast cancer adequately irradiate limited node-positive disease, not treated with ALND?",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): NSABP B32 established Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as the standard of care in clinically node negative early breast cancer and completion ALND became the standard of care for SLNB positive disease. However, the ACOSOG =0011 trial demonstrated equivalent survival & loco-regional recurrence rates in patients with 1-2 SLN nodes treated with either ALND or no further treatment. The AMAROS trial has further established surgery and axillary radiation as equivalent in terms of axillary recurrence. Are the tangential fields used in ACOSOG =11 and axillary radiation fields used in AMAROS comparable in terms of local recurrence? The present study was undertaken to examine if the doses of incidental irradiation to nodal levels 1 and 2 of the post- op axilla during tangential field photon irradiation are sufficient for us to confidently omit ALND in 1-2 SLNB positive limited nodal disease in our institution. Materials/Methods: Levels 1 and 2 axillary nodes were contoured as per the RTOG atlas recommendations on axial CT simulation images of 41 patients with early breast cancer treated from Jan - Dec 2013. To reduce interpersonal variation, the contouring was done by a single radiation oncologist on plans approved by 5 different radiation oncologists. All patients received standard whole breast/chest wall irradiation alone following breast conserving surgery/mastectomy with two tangential photon fields. Dose-volume histograms were used to calculate the volume and radiation dose received by the level 1 & 2 axillary nodal regions both at the 95% isodose & the prescription isodose when the whole breast was treated to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions Results: The mean breast volume was 929.5 c, ranging from 320 cc to 2136 cc and varied with the build (? BMI) of the patient and surgery done. Mean volumes of Level 1 and Level 2 were 96.3 cc & 36.8 cc, respectively. Mean doses to levels 1 was 2 were 39 % & 43% of the prescription dose, ranged from 0 - 96% and were consistently lower than therapeutic in all patients.V95% to the breast ranged from 3471 cGy to 5185 cGy. Conclusions: The incidental radiation dose to the levels 1 -2 axillary nodes while treating the whole breast by conventional tangential fields is extremely variable and consistently lower than therapeutic. It is unlikely that this dose alone can contribute to the complete eradication of node positive axillary disease. Decision to irradiate the axilla will have to take into consideration biological parameters like age, hormone, & HER 2 receptors, LVSI and PNI. If irradiation of the SLNB positive patient, not undergoing ALND, is undertaken because of the risk of non-sentinel nodes, it will require specific contouring of the axillary nodes and probably 3D-CRT / IMRT for better dose distributions."
"Rashtian, A., et al.",2012,Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): A single institution study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The majority of local recurrences for DCIS after breast conservation therapy occur within the lumpectomy cavity. Thus, giving radiation to the tumor bed only may be adequate for selected patients. Published data from the TARGIT trial have shown that IORT is effective in treating select early stage invasive breast cancer with shortterm follow up. We reviewed our single institution experience with the use of IORT after lumpectomy for patients with DCIS of the breast. Materials/Methods: Between 2006 and 2011, 23 patients with pure DCIS of the breast were treated with lumpectomy and IORT to 5 Gy at 1.0 cm from applicator surface. The size of the DCIS ranged from 0.2 cm to 3.6 cm. The range in age at diagnosis was 45-79 years old. Eleven patients (49%) had high-grade tumors and eight (35%) had comedonecrosis. Margins were negative in all patients and ranged from 0.28 cm to >1.0 cm. Hormone receptor status was known for all patients with 17 (74%) having ER+ disease. Actuarial local control was calculated using the Kaplan- Meier method. Results: The median follow-up was 18.3 months. The 3-year actuarial local control rate was 93.3%. One recurrence was noted 12 months after IORT in close proximity to tumor bed. This patients was 49 years old at diagnosis and had a 1.2 cm DCIS, grade 3, with solid and cribriform pattern, ER/PR+, and a 0.5 cm closest superior margin. She did not receive endocrine therapy. Conclusion: For selected patients with DCIS, IORT is a feasible treatment option and may be considered as an alternative to conventional whole breast radiation and/or other forms of partial breast radiation. Longer follow-up is needed to prove that this treatment technique offers equal efficacy when compared to the gold standard of whole breast radiation."

Thus, giving radiation to the tumor bed only may be adequate for selected patients. Published data from the TARGIT trial have shown that IORT is effective in treating select early stage invasive breast cancer; albeit with short-term follow up. We reviewed our single institution experience regarding the use of IORT after lumpectomy for patients with invasive breast cancer. Material/Methods: Between 2005 and 2011, 57 patients with invasive breast cancer were treated with lumpectomy and IORT prescribed to 5 Gy at 1.0 cm from the applicator surface. Median age at diagnosis was 60 (range, 41 to 87). The size of the invasive breast cancers ranged from 0.25 cm to 2.8 cm. Every patient had either a sentinel lymph node biopsy or a full lymph node dissection, and six (10.5%) of the patients were lymph node positive, two of which received their whole breast radiation at our institution. No one had more than one lymph node positive. Modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) scores ranged from 4 to 9 out of 9. Five patients were ER/PR and HER2/neu negative. The rest were ER/PR positive and HER2/neu negative. Margins were all negative and ranged from 2 mm to >10mm. Actuarial local control was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier Method. Results: At a median follow up of 26.8 months, there was one local recurrence in the 57 patients treated, with a five-year actuarial local control of 94%. This patient was 74 years old at diagnosis that had a 1.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma with SBR of 6 out of 9, ER/PR positive and HER2/neu negative. Despite a 10mm negative margin, the patient developed recurrence in the treated area 55 months later. Conclusions: For selected patients with invasive breast cancer, IORT is a feasible treatment option and may be considered as an alternative to conventional whole breast radiation and/or other forms of partial breast radiation. Longer follow-up is needed to prove equal efficacy when compared to the gold standard of whole breast radiation."

We evaluated BMI and its impact on ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), cosmesis, and incidence of other malignancies in early stage breast cancer patients treated by APBI using the MammoSite. Materials/Methods: Between June 2003 and December 2009, 83 postmenopausal patients (76 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 7 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer and node negative status met our inclusion criteria for (APBI) using the single lumen balloon catheter (SLM). A dose of 3400 cGy was prescribed in 10 fractions at distance of 1cm from surface of balloon delivered twice daily, 6 hours apart using the high dose rate system. BMI was classified as 18.5 to <25Kg/m2 (normal, NL), 25- <30Kg/m2 (overweight, OV), 30-39kg/m2 (obese, OB), >40Kg/m2 (extreme obese, EO). Cosmesis was graded as Excellent/Good (E/G) vs. Fair/Poor (F/P). Bra and cup sizes were categorized. Mann Whitney test or t-test was used to compare groups with respect to BMI and dosimetric parameters. Overall survival was estimated using the K-M method. Results: Mean age of 83 patients was 72.65.Mean BMI was 30.34≥6.23 (range: 21 to 54). Median follow-up was 66.5 months. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 18% (14/76) and hormones in 85% ER+ IDC patients. IBTR occurred in 2/83 patients at 93.5 months (ER+, PR+, HER2-, BMI =24.5, normal, cosmesisZGOOD) and 47.2 months (ER-, PR-, HER2+, BMI = 33.4, obese, cosmesis Z GOOD), respectively. There were increased number of grade 2/3 tumors in the OB/EO group than NL/OV (82.86% (29/35) vs. 55.3% (26/47); p < 0.01). Cosmesis was excellent or good in 98% and there was no significant association with BMI, Bra, or cup size or with any dosimetric parameters. There were 17 'other malignancies' (20.5%). A higher proportion of OB/EO developed 'other malignancies' compared to others, and was not statistically significant (25.7% (9/35) vs. 16.7% (8/48); p=.41). Twelve deaths were unrelated to breast cancer. The overall 5-year survival was 86.7% (95% CI: (75.8% to 92.9%)). Conclusions: At median follow up of 66 months, APBI treatment using balloon catheter resulted in 97.6% locoregional control with excellent- Good cosmesis. There was no significant association with BMI and outcomes or cosmesis in this study. This should be further investigated in a larger study."
"Ravi, A., et al.",2011,Evaluation of loco-regional recurrence following partial breast irradiation in early stage node negative breast cancer treated by mammosite: Median follow-up of 54 months.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate treatment outcome with regard to loco regional recurrence, in ASTRO consensus panel “suitable” and “cautionary” groups and “triple negative”(ER, PR,HER-2) early stage node negative, postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using single lumen MammoSite. Materials/Methods: Between June 2003 and December 2009, 83 post-menopausal patients (76 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 7 Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a diagnosis of early stage breast cancer and node negative status met our inclusion criteria for (APBI) using the single lumen MammoSite balloon catheter. Following a CT scan based 3D plan a dose of 3400cGy was prescribed in 10 fractions at distance of 1cm from surface of balloon delivered twice daily, 6 hours apart using the high dose rate system. Patients were categorized as suitable, cautionary or triple negative. Data on treatment outcome with respect to ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), Tumor bed area failure (TBF), elsewhere failure in the same breast (EF) and ipsilateral axilla failure (IAF) and incidence of contra lateral breast cancer (CBC) was analyzed. Results: There were 42/83 (51%) patients in the “Suitable” and 41/83 (49%) in the “cautionary” group. 11% of invasive cancer patients were triple negative. Mean age of IDC patients was 72.5 years. Median follow-up for all 83 patients was 54.4 months; cautionary group = 54.4 months; triple negative = 55; suitable group = 52. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 18% (14/76) and hormones in 85% ER+ IDC patients. IBTR occurred in 1/83 (1.2%) patient of the cautionary group (ER negative, HER-2 positive). Time to IBTR was 48 months. Patient opted mastectomy and was found to have EF, a triple negative tumor in opposite quadrant of the breast with a metastatic axillary node (IAF). No IBTR occurred in suitable or triple negative patient groups. There were no TBF or distant recurrences seen in any of the 83 patients. There was a significant association between tumor grade and ethnicity with grade 3 tumors seen more in Hispanic and black women as compared to all others. (31% vs. 8%; p = 0.03). All 10 (12%) deaths were unrelated to breast cancer. Contra lateral breast cancer was seen in 7 patients; 5 were treated with lumpectomy and external beam radiation; 1 had mastectomy and 1 was treated elsewhere. Conclusions: There was very low occurrence of IBTR with good local and regional control in suitable, cautionary or triple negative group of post-menopausal node negative early breast cancer patients treated with APBI using the MammoSite balloon device. It is appropriate to use caution in “cautionary” ER negative patients until longer follow-up is available."
"Recht, A., et al.",1988,The effect of young age on tumor recurrence in the treated breast after conservative surgery and radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Prognostic factors for local recurrence following conservative surgery and radiation therapy for patients with early breast cancer have not been fully established. To evaluate the importance of young age as a prognostic factor for local recurrence, we reviewed the results of treatment of 597 patients with 607 UICC-AJCC Stage I or II breast cancers, 47 of which were diagnosed when the patient was less than 35 years old. All were treated with excisional biopsy and a total dose to the site of the primary tumor of 60 Gy or more. The median follow-up in survivors was 63 months. Patient age and the presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC) were both highly associated with the likelihood of tumor recurrence in the treated breast. Patients under 35 had an actuarial 5-year recurrence rate of 26%, compared to 10% for older patients (p = 0.002). Patients with an EIC had a breast recurrence rate of 25%, compared to 5% when EIC was absent (P < 0.0001). Although the incidence of an EIC was higher in the younger subgroup (44% vs. 31%), this alone did not account for the difference in breast recurrence rates, since younger patients had a higher recurrence rate than older patients even when an EIC was absent (22% vs. 3%, p = 0.0003). We conclude that the age of the patient is an important prognostic factor for local recurrence following conservative surgery and radiation therapy. This finding is in part attributed to the observation that younger women are more likely to have tumors with an EIC than older women, but even when an EIC is absent, they may be at an increased risk of local recurrence. However, caution is required in interpreting these findings with regard to selecting among treatment options until further data are available comparing the results of conservative surgery and radiation therapy to those of mastectomy in younger patients."
"Recht, A., et al.",2019,Contemporary Guidelines in Whole-Breast Irradiation: An Alternative Perspective.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,The American Society for Radiation Oncology produced an evidence-based guideline on whole-breast radiation therapy for patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ. This commentary points out areas where we believe the data are too limited to make definitive recommendations and where alternative approaches are supported by evidence.
"Recht, A., et al.",1988,Time-course of local recurrence following conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The time-course of local failure following conservative surgery and radiotherapy (S+RT) for early breast cancer is not well established. We therefore examined the time-course and patterns of breast recurrence as a first site of treatment failure in a group of 607 AJCC clinical Stage I or II invasive breast carcinomas treated from 1968-81. Sixty-seven patients had a breast failure (11%), corresponding to 5- and 10-year actuarial rates of 10% and 16%. The hazard rate (i.e., the risk per unit time of a failure) for any breast failure increased over the first 2 years, was fairly constant at about 2.5%/year over the period from 2 to 6 years after treatment, and then decreased to about 1%/year at 8 years. The majority of failures were at or near the primary tumor site (33 true recurrences (TR) and 15 marginal misses (MM)). In addition there were 12 failures at sites at least several cm from the boosted volume (E), 6 recurrences in the skin without a parenchymal mass (S), and 1 patient with an unclassifiable failure. Recurrences at or near the primary site (TR/MM) occurred earlier (median 38.5 mo, range 12-87 mo) than recurrences at distant sites in the breast (E) (median 64.5 mo, range 26-90). The hazard rate for TR/MM increased over the first 2 1/2 years to reach approximately 2%/year, remained at that level till about 5 years after treatment, and then decreased to about 0.5%/year at 8 years following RT. By contrast, the hazard rate for E increased slowly with time to approximately 1%/year at 5 years, with little change in the rate after that time. We conclude that the time-course of the development of local recurrence after S+RT is protracted. The majority of failures appear at or near the primary tumor site; these are seen mainly in the first 7 years following RT. Recurrences at distant sites in the breast have an even more protracted time-course. Such recurrences are rare in the first 4 years following RT. Our results emphasize the need to obtain long follow-up in these patients, both to detect these recurrences promptly and to properly evaluate the results of S+RT."
"Recht, A., et al.",1985,"Breast relapse following primary radiation therapy for early breast cancer. I. Classification, frequency and salvage.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Primary radiation therapy has become an accepted alternative to mastectomy for patients with early breast cancer. In order to improve the results of this treatment, we performed an analysis of failure on 366 clinical Stage I or II invasive breast carcinomas treated with primary radiation therapy. With a median follow-up of 52 months, there have been 30 recurrences in the treated breast, for a 5 year actuarial local recurrence rate of 9%. The recurrence rate was much higher for patients having less-than-excisional biopsy than for those undergoing excisional biopsy (35% vs. 7%, p < 0.0001). Failures in the treated breast have been categorized as: true recurrence (TR), directly at the site of the primary; marginal miss (MM), at the edge of the boosted volume; and elsewhere in the breast (E). For patients having excisional biopsy, the actuarial probability of a true recurrence at 5 years was 4%. The risk of a true recurrence was related to the dose given to the primary site with rare true recurrences seen with doses greater than 6000 rad. The probability of a marginal miss at 5 years was 4%, and was not related to the dose or volume of the boost used. The probability of a recurrence elsewhere in the breast at 5 years was 1%. In patients treated with excisional biopsy and a total primary dose over 6000 rad, the probability of a local recurrence at 5 years was 4 and 10% for clinical Stage I and II patients respectively. These results indicate that primary radiation therapy provides a high likelihood of local tumor control and our analysis of failure suggests methods for decreasing each type of local recurrence."
"Reddy, J., et al.",2016,Using quantitative metrics of breast cosmesis to compare fractionation regimens for whole-breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adoption of HF-WBI in the US has been limited despite evidence demonstrating its effectiveness and safety. An important barrier to adoption is the concern of worse cosmetic outcome with HFWBI when a tumor bed boost is used. We conducted a randomized trial comparing CF-WBI to HF-WBI, both followed by a tumor bed boost. The purpose of this study is to compare cosmetic outcome by treatment arm using quantitative metrics derived from photographs obtained one year after treatment. Materials/Methods: From 2011-2014, 287 women age 40 and older with DCIS or early invasive breast cancer were randomized to HF-WBI (42.56 Gy/16 fx + 10-12.5 Gy/4-5 fx boost) or CF-WBI (50 Gy/25 fx + 10-14 Gy/5-7 fx). At one year post-treatment, we collected digital photos, physicianreported cosmesis (assessed by the treating physician using the Harvard scale), and patient-reported cosmesis (assessed using the validated Breast Cancer Treatment and Outcomes Scale [BCTOS]). Using digital photos, seven quantitative measures were calculated by an observer blinded to randomization arm. These measures, labeled M1-M7, describe vertical and horizontal symmetry of the nipple and breast mound. For each measure, values closer to 1 imply symmetry, and values closer to 0 imply asymmetry. To identify clinically meaningful measures, non-parametric tests determined which measures significantly correlated with physician-and/or patient-reported cosmesis. Results: Of the seven measures evaluated, patient-and physician-reported cosmesis was associated with M1 (ratio of nipple vertical position differences over horizontal position differences) and M2 (ratio of nipple vertical displacement over the lowest visible point of the breast) (P<0.05 for each comparison, see Table 1). M1 and M2 values at oneyear post-treatment did not differ by randomization arm, with median M1 of 0.95 for the CF-WBI treatment group versus 0.94 for the HFWBI group ( P = 0.79), and median M2 of 0.68 and 0.7, respectively ( P = 0.65). Conclusion: Objective measures of vertical symmetry were strongly predictive of patient-and physician-reported cosmesis in this randomized trial. There was no difference in these measures by randomization arm one year after completing radiation, suggesting that HF-WBI followed by a boost does not degrade early cosmetic outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first study to validate quantitative measures of breast cosmesis using patient-and physician-reported outcomes and to use these measures to compare cosmesis between RT fractionation regimens."
"Reddy, J. P., et al.",2017,Quantitative Assessment of Breast Cosmetic Outcome After Whole-Breast Irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To measure, by quantitative analysis of digital photographs, breast cosmetic outcome within the setting of a randomized trial of conventionally fractionated (CF) and hypofractionated (HF) whole-breast irradiation (WBI), to identify how quantitative cosmesis metrics were associated with patient- and physician-reported cosmesis and whether they differed by treatment arm. Methods and Materials From 2011 to 2014, 287 women aged ≥40 with ductal carcinoma in situ or early invasive breast cancer were randomized to HF-WBI (42.56 Gy/16 fractions [fx] + 10-12.5 Gy/4-5 fx boost) or CF-WBI (50 Gy/25 fx + 10-14 Gy/5-7 fx). At 1 year after treatment we collected digital photographs, patient-reported cosmesis using the Breast Cancer Treatment and Outcomes Scale, and physician-reported cosmesis using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Six quantitative measures of breast symmetry, labeled M1-M6, were calculated from anteroposterior digital photographs. For each measure, values closer to 1 imply greater symmetry, and values closer to 0 imply greater asymmetry. Associations between M1-M6 and patient- and physician-reported cosmesis and treatment arm were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results Among 245 evaluable patients, patient-reported cosmesis was strongly associated with M1 (vertical symmetry measure) (P<.01). Physician-reported cosmesis was similarly correlated with M1 (P<.01) and also with M2 (vertical symmetry, P=.01) and M4 (horizontal symmetry, P=.03). At 1 year after treatment, HF-WBI resulted in better values of M2 (P=.02) and M3 (P<.01) than CF-WBI; treatment arm was not significantly associated with M1, M4, M5, or M6 (P≥.12). Conclusions Quantitative assessment of breast photographs reveals similar to improved cosmetic outcome with HF-WBI compared with CF-WBI 1 year after treatment. Assessing cosmetic outcome using these measures could be useful for future comparative effectiveness studies and outcome reporting."
"Reed, D. R., et al.",2005,Axillary lymph node dose with tangential breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The advent of sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy in the staging of breast cancer has resulted in a significant decrease in the extent of axillary nodal surgery. As the extent of axillary surgery decreases, the radiation dose and distribution within the axilla becomes increasingly important for current therapy planning and future analysis of results. This analysis examined the radiation dose distribution delivered to the anatomically defined axillary level I and II lymph node volume and surgically placed axillary clips with conventional tangential breast fields and CT-based three-dimensional (3D) planning. Fifty consecutive patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast conservation therapy were evaluated. All patients underwent 3D CT-based planning with conventional breast tangential fields designed to encompass the entire breast parenchyma. Using CT-based 3D planning, the dose distribution of the standard tangential breast irradiation fields was examined in relationship to the axillary level I and II lymph node volumes. Axillary level I and II lymph node anatomic volumes were defined by CT and surgical clips placed during complete level I-II lymph node dissection. Axillary level I-II lymph node volume doses were examined on the basis of the prescribed breast radiation dose and 3D dose distribution. All defined breast volumes received <95% of the prescribed dose. By contrast, the 95% isodose line encompassed only an average of 55% (range, 23-87%) of the axillary level I-II lymph node anatomic volume. No patient had complete coverage of the axillary level I-II lymph node region by the 95% isodose line. The mean anatomic axillary level I-II volume was 146.3 cm3 (range, 83.1-313.0 cm3). The mean anatomic axillary level I-II volume encompassed by the 95% isodose line was 84.9 cm3 (range, 25.1-219.0 cm3). The mean 95% isodose coverage of the surgical clip volume was 80%, and the median value was 81% (range, 58-98%). The mean volume deficit between the axillary level I-II volume and the surgical clip volume was 41.7 cm3 (median, 30.0 cc). In this study, standard tangential breast radiation fields failed to deliver a therapeutic dose adequately to the axillary level I-II lymph node anatomic volume. No patient received complete coverage of the axillary level I-II lymph node volume. Surgically placed axillary clips also failed to delineate the level I-II axilla adequately. Definitive irradiation of the level I and II axillary lymph node region requires significant modification of standard tangential fields, best accomplished with 3D treatment planning, with specific targeting of anatomically defined axillary lymph node volumes as described, in addition to the breast parenchymal volumes.

"Rescigno, J., et al.",1994,Breast cellulitis after conservative surgery and radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Cellulitis is a previously unreported complication of conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer. Patients who presented with breast cellulitis after conservative therapy are described. Methods and Materials: Eleven patients that developed cellulitis of the breast over a 38-month period of observation are the subject of this report. Clinical characteristics of patients with cellulitis and their treatment and outcome are reported. Potential patient and treatment-related correlates for the development of cellulitis are analyzed. Results: The risk of cellulitis persists years after initial breast cancer therapy. The clinical course of our patients was variable: some patients required aggressive, long-duration antibiotic therapy, while others had rapid resolution with antibiotics. Three patients suffered from multiple episodes of cellulitis. Conclusion: Patients with breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy are at risk for breast cellulitis.

H., et al.",2015,Patterns of care for omission of radiation therapy for elderly women with early-stage breast cancer receiving hormonal therapy.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Purpose: For well-selected elderly women who undergo segmental mastectomy for early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, hormonal therapy alone is emerging as an acceptable adjuvant therapy option since the initial publication of Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 study in 2004 and update in 2013. The rate of adoption of adjuvant hormonal therapy alone in lieu of radiation therapy (RT) and its associated patterns of care is not known in the United States and was the subject of this study. Methods and materials: We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify women aged ≥. 70 diagnosed with T1N0/T1Nx invasive breast cancer who underwent segmental mastectomy between 1998 and 2011. Because hormone receptor status was not specifically and reliably coded, only those who received hormonal therapy were included in this analysis. Univariate and multivariable exploratory analyses of factors associated with the use of RT were performed using SPSS, version 17.0. Results: Of the 182,115 patients who met inclusion criteria, 97,530 (53.6%) patients underwent hormonal therapy and were included in the analysis. The RT utilization rate in this subset decreased with time from 84.9% in 1998 to 75.1% in 2011 (P<.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that the factors associated with decreased use of RT include (in order of association): older age, later year of diagnosis, greater comorbidity score, low grade, lack of insurance, treatment at academic facility, race, rural location, lower median income, and distance from facility. Conclusions: This study assesses the patterns of care associated with the omission of RT in elderly women with early-stage breast cancer who received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Since the publication of major clinical trials, this strategy has been increasingly adopted. The strongest predictors of using this strategy included advanced patient age, high comorbidity score, and low-grade disease."

"Ríos Pozo, M. B., et al.",2014,Locoregional recurrence of early breast cancer according to intrinsic subtype.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to assess the pattern of locoregional (LC) recurrence of early breast cancer (BC) patients treated with surgery +/- chemotherapy (QT) +/ hormone therapy+/- adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) according to intrinsic subtype (IS). Materials/Methods: 1249 female patients diagnosed with stages I to III BC were included prospectively in a control database from 1982 to 2008. The patients were uniformly treated according to clinical guidelines IS definitions by six biomarkers were as follows: 540 patients were luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, HER 2-, Ki67 < 14, any CK5/6, any EGFR), 376 were luminal B (ER+ and /or PR+, HER 2-, Ki67≥ 14, any CK5/6, any EGFR), 74 were HER 2-enriched (ER-, PR-, HER 2+, any Ki 67, any CK5/6, any EGFR), 77 were luminal HER 2 (ER+ and /or PR+, HER 2+, any Ki67, any CK5/6, any EGFR), 49 Triple-negative (TN) non basal like (ER-, PR-, HER 2-, any Ki 67, CK5/6-, EGFR-) and 133 were basal like (ER-, PR-, HER 2-, any Ki67, CK5/6 +, EGFR+).The endpoint was BC-free survival (BCFS) as defined as the time from surgery until a LC recurrence. The relationships between the various prognostic factors and BCFS were assessed using a Cox proportional hazard regression. Results: The median follow-up was 73.7 months, there were 344 events (27.5%) of which the first event was distant relapse in 273 cases, LC recurrence in 63 cases (25 Luminal A, 17 Luminal B, 4 HER 2-enriches, 4 luminal HER 2, 3 TN non basal like, 10 basal like) and contralateral tumors in 8 cases. There are 4.58% LC recurrence in Luminal subtypes, 5.405% in HER 2 enriched, 5.194% in luminal HER 2, 6.122% in TN non basal like, and 7.515% in Basal like. The final model for multivariate analyses of BCFS for patients classified using biomarkers revealed that tumor size, lymph node status, type of local therapy, use of adjuvant endocrine therapy and intrinsic subtypes were significant independent predictors of disease recurrence. The analysis of compliance with proportional hazards assumptions were rejected (p < 0.0001) indicating that recurrence risks were not proportional over the time. In the Kaplan- Meier data, there were no appreciable absolute differences in 3 year and 5 year BCFS between luminal A and luminal B (7.6% and 8.7% respectively), luminal A and HER 2-enriched (19.5% and 17.1% respectively), or Luminal A and Triple-Negative (18.3% and 17.4%, respectively). However, the hazard function analysis detected noteworthy differences in the relapse risk between these subgroups at the same time points. Conclusions: Each IS has a particular pattern of relapses over the time. Prospective randomized studies are needed to investigate the best LC treatment for each patient and the best timing of treatment administration. The adjuvant treatment could be tailored more accurately according to each IS. Some of these subtypes potentially may benefit from more aggressive local treatment (RT) or more aggressive QT schedules."
"Rock, K., et al.",2016,Local control in young women with early-stage breast cancer treated with hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Randomized clinical trials have shown equivalent local control for patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) treated with conventional fractionation (CF) or hypofractionated (HF) adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT). However, women less than 50 years of age have been underrepresented in these trials, and controversy still remains in relation to optimal fractionation schedule in this patient group. Our institutional policy allows for both schedules, therefore we compared local control in young women following breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and identified factors associated with recommendation of CF or HF schedule. Materials/Methods: Two hundred seventy-one women under 50 years of age with early-stage invasive BC (pT1-T2, pN0) treated from September 2009 to December 2013 were identified from an institutional database. BCS was followed by adjuvant CF (50 Gy in 25 fractions) or HF (40 or 42.4 Gy in 16 fractions) WBRT, followed by a boost to the tumor bed of 10-16 Gy in in 5-8 fractions. Data on tumor characteristics and adjuvant systemic therapies were collected. Length of follow-up was calculated from the completion date of radiation therapy (RT) to the date of most recent imaging or clinical review in which disease status was recorded. Results: Two hundred twenty-seven (83.8%) patients were treated with HF and 44 (16.2%) with CF WBRT. Median follow-up was 2.9 years (range 0-5.8 years) and median age was 42.8 years (range 19-49 years). Most patients had invasive ductal carcinoma (94%), unifocal (86%), grade 1 or 2 (65%) and ER positive (88%) disease, of which 81% received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Lymphovascular invasion was associated in 16%, 54% received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, 14% had HER2-positive disease and 8.5% of cases were triple negative (TN). Local control was achieved in 225 (99.1%) and 43 (97.7%) patients in the HF and CF groups, respectively. The mean age ( ± standard deviation) of patients receiving HF was 43.5 ± 4.5 years, and 39.3 ± 7.5 years for the CF group (P<0.01). On univariate analysis, age greater than 40 years was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving HF WBRT (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.32-4.87), and patients with TN disease were 67% more likely to receive CF WBRT (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.87). No other differences were identified between the CF and HF groups, including receipt of systemic therapies. Conclusion: Young women with early-stage BC treated with HF WBRT following BCS obtained excellent local control that was comparable to CF WBRT. At our institution, HF was more likely to be recommended for women over 40 years of age or for non-TN BC in this patient population. HF WBRT shortens total treatment time, is more convenient for patients, and may be considered for women less than 50 years of age."
"Rodriguez De Dios, N., et al.",2012,Interim cosmetic results and toxicity using 3d conformal external beam radiation therapy to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients with early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Concerns with the use of any form of APBI relate to the large fraction sizes administered and a possible increase in the rate of development of late effects. We analyzed toxicity and cosmetics results using three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy (3DCRT) to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation in our phase III trial. Materials/Methods: One hundred patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery were randomized to receive WBRT (n = 51) or APBI (n = 49). The whole breast received 48 Gy with 2-Gy daily fractions, with or without additional 10 Gy irradiation to the tumor bed, depending on local recurrence risk factors. In APBI arm, patients received 37.5 Gy in 3.75 Gy/ fraction delivered twice daily. Toxicity results were scored based on the RTOG Common Toxicity Criteria. Late skin toxicity was measured by Multi-Skin-Center MC-750-B2, CKelectronic-GmbH, which allow the users to put together measuring parameters for the skin: pigmentation (melanin), redness (erythema), TEWL (transepidermal waterloss index) and elasticity. Cosmetic results were rated as good/excellent, regular or poor cosmetic result by the treating radiation oncologist and every patient. Results: With a median follow-up of 6 years, no local recurrences were developed. Acute skin effects were noted in 43/49 patients of APBI arm (69.4% grade I and 18.4% grade II) and in all patients of control arm (25.5% grade I, 62.7% grade II and 11.8% grade III). Only one case of grade II acute pneumonitis was noted and it was in one woman of the WBRT arm. As show in the Table, late skin toxicity was similar between two arms and only grades I and II late effects were reported. Elasticity was lower in highest doses area (boost or quadrant) than in ipsilateral breast. Taking into account only this area, elasticity was lower in WBRTarm than in APBI arm. Conclusions: Delivery of APBI with 3D-CRT resulted in minimal chronic (>6 months) toxicity to date with good/excellent cosmetic results. Additional follow-up is needed to assess the long-term efficacy of this form of APBI. Therefore, this noninvasive approach may increase the availability of APBI to patients with early-stage breast cancer. (Table Presented) ."
"Rodríguez, N., et al.",2013,"Five-year outcomes, cosmesis, and toxicity with 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To report the interim results from a study comparing the efficacy, toxicity, and cosmesis of breast-conserving treatment with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or whole breast irradiation (WBI) using 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy (3D-CRT). Methods and Materials 102 patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery were randomized to receive either WBI (n=51) or APBI (n=51). In the WBI arm, 48 Gy was delivered to the whole breast in daily fractions of 2 Gy, with or without additional 10 Gy to the tumor bed. In the APBI arm, patients received 37.5 Gy in 3.75 Gy per fraction delivered twice daily. Toxicity results were scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Common Toxicity Criteria. Skin elasticity was measured using a dedicated device (Multi-Skin-Test-Center MC-750-B2, CKelectronic-GmbH). Cosmetic results were assessed by the physician and the patients as good/excellent, regular, or poor. Results The median follow-up time was 5 years. No local recurrences were observed. No significant differences in survival rates were found. APBI reduced acute side effects and radiation doses to healthy tissues compared with WBI (P<.01). Late skin toxicity was no worse than grade 2 in either group, without significant differences between the 2 groups. In the ipsilateral breast, the areas that received the highest doses (ie, the boost or quadrant) showed the greatest loss of elasticity. WBI resulted in a greater loss of elasticity in the high-dose area compared with APBI (P<.05). Physician assessment showed that >75% of patients in the APBI arm had excellent or good cosmesis, and these outcomes appear to be stable over time. The percentage of patients with excellent/good cosmetic results was similar in both groups. Conclusions APBI delivered by 3D-CRT to the tumor bed for a selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients produces 5-year results similar to those achieved with conventional WBI.  The Authors.

"Rutqvist, L. E., et al.",1989,"Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen as adjuncts to surgery in early breast cancer: A summary of three randomized trials.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The paper summarizes up-dated results of three randomized adjuvant trials from the Stockholm Breast Cancer Group. The objective of all studies included an evaluation of the role of megavoltage radiation in the primary management of patients with early breast cancer. The first trial was started in 1971 and included 960 pre- and postmenopausal patients with operable disease. The study compared adjuvant radiotherapy with surgery alone. All patients were treated with a modified radical mastectomy. There was a sustained improvement of the recurrence-free survival with radiotherapy (p < 0.001). Among node positive cases radiation reduced the frequency of both loco-regional recurrence (p < 0.001) and distant metastasis (p < 0.01). This observation indicates that distant dissemination in subgroups of patients can originate from uncontrolled local deposits of tumor cells, for instance the regional lymph nodes. No adverse effect from radiation on long-term survival was observed. The second study was started in 1976 and compared postmastectomy radiation with adjuvant chemotherapy in pre- and post-menopausal high-risk patients. At a mean follow-up of 6 1/2 years there was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two treatments. However, postmenopausal patients fared better with radiotherapy (p < 0.02). In this subgroup, radiation was more effective than adjuvant chemotherapy in reducing both distant metastases (p < 0.01) and loco-regional recurrences (p < 0.001). In the third trial - which only included post menopausal patients - 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen was compared with no adjuvant endocrine treatment. The number of treatment failures was significantly reduced with tamoxifen (p < 0.01) but there was no significant overall survival benefit. Subset analysis indicated that tamoxifen improved the recurrence-free survival among patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.01) but only to a level close to that achieved with radiotherapy alone. Addition of tamoxifen to radiotherapy failed to further increase the recurrence-free survival."
"Rutqvist, L. E., et al.",1992,Cardiovascular mortality in a randomized trial of adjuvant radiation therapy versus surgery alone in primary breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"One concern with adjuvant radiation therapy for early breast cancer is the potential risk of increasing intercurrent mortality due to radiation-induced damage of the myocardium. The paper presents an analysis of long-term survival among 960 patients with primary breast cancer included in a randomized trial of pre- or postoperative radiation therapy (45 Gy/5 weeks) versus surgery alone. All patients were treated with a modified radical mastectomy. The mean follow-up was 16 years (range: 13-19 years). During the entire follow-up period there was an overall survival difference in favor of the irradiated patients that was of borderline significance (p = 0.09). There was no increase in intercurrent mortality due to any cause. However, when the results were analyzed according to estimated doses of radiation to the myocardium, the subset of patients who received the highest doses, that is, those treated with tangential 60Co fields for left-sided tumors, were found to have a significantly increased risk of death due to ischemic heart disease compared to the surgical controls (relative hazard: 3.2, p < 0.05). No such increase was observed among the patients who received less radiation to the myocardium, that is, whose chest wall and internal mammary nodes were treated with electrons or those with right-sided tumors, irrespective of the treatment technique. It is concluded that cardiovascular mortality associated with radiation therapy for early breast cancer is correlated with the biological dose of radiation to the heart and the irradiated volume. All of the following factors are thus important: laterality of the tumor, portal arrangements, radiation energy, fractionation, and total dose. The study illustrates that an increased cardiovascular mortality can be avoided by the use of appropriate techniques and avoidance of excessive treatment."
"Rutqvist, L. E., et al.",1998,Myocardial infarction among women with early-stage breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess the possible impact of the irradiation on the risk of acute myocardial infarction among breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Methods and Materials: The incidence of and mortality from acute myocardial infarction was assessed in a group of 684 women with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed during 1976-1987 who had been treated with breast conserving surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy given with tangential photon fields. In 94% of the patients the total dose was between 48-52 Gy given with 2 Gy daily fractions 5 days per week for a total treatment period of about 4 1/4 - 5 1/4 weeks. IN 88% of the patients the target volume included the breast parenchyma alone. In the remaining patients regional nodal areas were also irradiated. A concurrent group of 4,996 breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy without postoperative radiation therapy was used as a reference. Results: After a median follow-up of 9 years (range: 5-16 years) 12 conservatively treated patients (1.8%) had developed an acute myocardial infarction and 5 (0.7%) had died due to this disease. The age-adjusted relative hazard of acute myocardial infarction for the conservative group vs. the mastectomy group was 0.6 (95% C.L.: 0.4-1.2) and for death due to this disease 0.4 (0.2-1.1). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction among the conservatively treated women was similar irrespective of tumor laterality. Conclusions: There was no indication of an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction with the radiation therapy among the women treated with conservative surgery. However, due to the small number of events the study could not exclude the possibility that cardiac problems may arise in some patients with left-sided cancers who have their heart located anteriority in the mediastinum. Individual, three-dimensional dose planning represents one method to identify such patients and is basic to technical changes aimed at decreasing the cardiac radiation dose volume."
"Rutter, C. E., et al.",2014,Evaluating national practice in breast cancer radiation therapy for elderly women: Response to a randomized trial and cost effectiveness on a national scale.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Elderly women with estrogen-receptor positive early stage breast cancer were shown to derive a small reduction in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) from adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy (RT) followed by a boost after lumpectomy in CALGB 9343 (C9343), initially published in 2004. We analyzed national practice before and after publication to assess the response to a landmark trial. Additionally, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of delivering a lumpectomy cavity boost in this low-risk patient population. Materials/Methods: National Cancer Database was queried to identify C9343-eligible women diagnosed from 1998 - 2010. Patients diagnosed in 2004 (year of C9343 publication) were excluded. The remaining patients were classified as having been diagnosed before or after C9343. Rates of adjuvant RT were compared between groups using chi-square tests. Binomial logistic regression was used to determine if demographic and pathologic factors influenced changes in rates of RT between time periods. Patterns in the use of boost were compared between cohorts. Finally, published costs and utilities were used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of delivering a lumpectomy cavity boost following whole breast radiation therapy using a decision tree. Results: A total of 74,740 patients were identified; 19,156 pre- and 55,584 post-C9343. Age and median tumor size were similar between cohorts. We observed a 6.64% increase in patients receiving RT post-C9343 (68.7% vs 75.3%, p < 0.001). Increased RT use was seen across all strata of covariates (p < 0.001). Boost was inconsistently recorded in the pre-C9343 era, precluding comparisons by era. However, post-C9343, boost was used less in older patients with increasing comorbidity. Of the 41,877 post-C9343 patients who received whole breast RT, 29,213 (69.8%) received a boost. Based on published data, 584 of these patients would be expected to develop IBTR. Withholding boost would instead yield 990 IBTR, an excess of 406 IBTR (HR for IBTR of 0.59 per EORTC 22881), while averting 818 excess cases of severe fibrosis. Using a cost-utility model, boost after whole breast RT was associated with a cost-increase of $1997 and gain of 0.001 QALY over no boost, yielding an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $1,799,099 / QALY. Conclusions: RT use has increased in the years following C9343 publication among eligible patients despite the small demonstrated benefit. A majority of post-C9343 patients received a lumpectomy cavity boost. In this population, the incremental benefit of boost in preventing additional IBTR is likely exceeded by the potential for severe fibrosis and additional costs of treatment, and is not cost-effective."
"Sabolch, A., et al.",2015,Decisions regarding accelerated partial-breast irradiation in a population-based sample of early-stage breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is increasingly used outside of clinical protocols. We sought to examine decision-making and experiences with APBI from the patient perspective. Materials/Methods: In 2013-14, we surveyed breast cancer patients identified by SEER registries of Georgia and Los Angeles about 6 months after diagnosis (survey receipt continues, current response rate 68%). We limited our sample to those who received breast-conserving surgery for unilateral disease and had initiated radiation therapy (RT) (N=794). We evaluated correlates of being offered APBI and receiving APBI in multivariable models including clinical and sociodemographic factors. Results: Of the sample, 79% had invasive disease (21% DCIS) and 87% were node negative. 82 patients (10%) received APBI and 712 (90%) whole breast irradiation (WBI). APBI was offered to 35% of women: 28% with DCIS, 37% with node(-) invasive disease, and 35% with node(+) disease. Of those offered APBI, 55% reported being told that it works as well as WBI, 16% that it is investigational, and 10% that it may lead to worse cosmesis. On multivariable analyses, being offered APBI was not significantly associated with any clinical or sociodemographic factors evaluated; receipt of APBI was more likely with older age (OR=1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.3 p=0.01 for +5 years) and node(-) invasive disease (OR=4.0, 95% CI: 1.8-8.7 p<0.001). Of those who received APBI, 13% had DCIS, 83% had node(-) invasive disease, and 5% had node(+) disease. APBI was delivered using external-beam, intracavitary brachytherapy, or interstitial brachytherapy in 11%, 87%, and 5% of cases (total >100% because some pts indicated more than one technique). Among 634 women who completed RT at the time of survey, 10% of APBI versus 25% of WBI patients reported a severe maximal skin reaction (p=0.004). When asked what concerns were important in making treatment decisions, APBI and WBI patients were similar in indicating desire to minimize worry about recurrence (87 v 79%, p=0.12), avoid side effects (71 v 70%, p=0.95), and avoid RT exposure (40 v 35%, p=0.36). More APBI pts desired treatments that required fewer visits (54 v 33%, p<0.001). 92 and 86% (p=0.18) of women receiving APBI and WBI, respectively, were satisfied with the decision to have RT; 98 versus 87% (p=0.005) indicated no regret in their decision to have RT. Conclusion: In this sample of early-stage breast cancer patients from the general population, about a third were offered APBI; few were told it is investigational. Brachytherapy was the most commonly used APBI technique. APBI patients prioritized similar concerns as WBI patients when making RT decisions but were more eager to reduce the number of treatment visits. APBI patients reported lesser maximal skin reaction and lower regret about the decision to have RT."
"Saibishkumar, E. P., et al.",2008,Skin-Sparing Radiation Using Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy After Conservative Surgery in Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Planning Study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of skin-sparing by configuring it as an organ-at-risk (OAR) while delivering whole-breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Archival computed tomography scan images of 14 left-sided early-breast tumor patients who had undergone lumpectomy were selected for this study. Skin was contoured as a 4- to 5-mm strip extending from the patient outline to anterior margin of the breast planning target volume (PTV). Two IMRT plans were generated by the helical tomotherapy approach to deliver 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the breast alone: one with skin dose constraints (skin-sparing plan) and the other without (non-skin-sparing plan). Comparison of the plans was done using a two-sided paired Student t test. Results: The mean skin dose and volume of skin receiving 50 Gy were significantly less with the skin-sparing plan compared with non-skin-sparing plan (42.3 Gy vs. 47.7 Gy and 12.2% vs. 57.8% respectively; p < 0.001). The reduction in skin dose was confirmed by TLD measurements in anthropomorphic phantom using the same plans. Dose-volume analyses for other OARs were similar in both plans. Conclusions: By configuring the skin as an OAR, it is possible to achieve skin dose reduction while delivering whole-breast IMRT without compromising dose profiles to PTV and OARs.  Inc.

"Saksornchai, K. and P. Rojpornpradit",2014,Local recurrence and overall survival rate after hypofractionated irradiation with concomitant boost in early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the local recurrence and survival rate of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation plus concomitant boost (HFC) comparing with conventional irradiation and sequential boost (CFS). Materials/Methods: This is a prospective non-randomized study. Between October 2009 and June 2010, seventy-three women with early breast cancer who had undergone breast-conserving surgery were enrolled in this study. Eligibility included patient aged ≥18 years, pT1-3N0-1M0, and ductal carcinoma. For the whole breast irradiation, 67.5% and 32.5% of patients were planned by 2D and 3D techniques, respectively. 36 patients (49.3%) received conventional irradiation of 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the whole breast with sequential electron boost of 10-16 Gy in 5-8 fractions. 37 patients (50.6%) received hypofractionated irradiation of 43.2 Gy in 16 fractions to the whole breast and a daily tumor bed boost of 0.6 Gy. Radiation boost treatment was planned using 2D and 3D techniques. 2D planning (89%) utilized preoperative imaging and surgical scar to define the location of the tumor bed, whereas CT planning (11%) was used for 3D technique. The total dose to the tumor bed in the CFS and HFC arms was 60-66 Gy and 52.8 Gy, respectively. Results: At a median follow-up of 49 months (range 21-62 months), one patient in the HFC and one in the CFS experienced local recurrences. Both of them were planned for tumor bed boost by 2D technique and their lesions were isolated local recurrence which occurred in the other quadrant of the index breast. However, there was no significant difference between the CFS and HFC arms in terms of local recurrence (2.7% vs 2.8%, respectively) p = 1.000 and overall survival rates (97.2% vs 97.3% , p = 1.000). Mean time to recurrence was 60.6 and 58.7 months for conventional and hypofractionated groups, respectively (p = 0.327). The two planning techniques were not associated with an increase in local recurrence rate (p = 1.000) on univariate analysis. Conclusions: HFC offered no significant difference in terms of local control and overall survival rates. 3D planning is preferred for tumor bed boost planning. Long-term follow-up is needed."
"Salinas, J., et al.",2019,Dosimetry and Acute Toxicity after Adjuvant Radiotherapy Delivered with a New Hybrid Technique in Early Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Introduction: Currently, adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy is the standard treatment in early breast cancer after conservative surgery, with a sequential boost when appropriated. However, simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) has been little explored in this setting. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate dosimetry and acute toxicity of a new technique of whole breast hypofractionation (WBH) with SÏB in patients with early breast cancer without nodal irradiation. Materials/Methods: Our newly developed hybrid technique consists of a mix of 3D and IMRT fields, delivering 40 Gy to the whole breast PTVWB and 48 Gy to the tumor bed PTVTB in 15 fractions. The planning process starts with setting 2 parallel opposed conformal 3D fields, covering the PTVWB and delivering 60% of the maximum prescribed dose (i.e. 200 cGy/fraction). Afterwards, 5 sliding-window IMRT fields are equi-spatially set spanning from the internal tangential beam angle to the external one. In the IMRT optimization process the 3D plan is used as a base plan and 3 goals are sought: i) boost the dose to the PTVTB, ii) dose homogenization to both PTVs, and iii) meet the OAR’s dose constraints Results: 79 consecutive patients were treated. Mean volume of PTVWB and PTVTB were 986 cc. (243-2169 cc.) and 69 cc. (13-223cc.) respectively. Mean V42.75Gy of the PTVWB was 14 cc. (3-32 cc.). Mean ipsilateral lung V16Gy, V8Gy and V4Gy were 13cc (2-21cc), 23cc (9-35cc) and 44cc (25-66cc) respectively. For contralateral lung mean V4Gy was 1cc (0-38cc). Mean heart dose: for left tumor side V16Gy and V8Gy and mean dose of heart were 3.3cc (0-8cc), 6.6cc (2-13cc) and 362cGy (495-274cGy) respectively; for right side V16Gy and V8Gy and mean dose of heart were 0.04cc (0-1.8cc), 0.54cc (0-6.3cc) and 214cGy (119-332cGy) respectively. Mean maximum dose to the contralateral breast was 514cGy (165-3381cGy) and V1, 44Gy 7cc (0-34cc). Most of the acute toxicities were Grade1. Only 5 out of 79 patients developed Grade 2 skin reaction during radiation (6%). Conclusion: WBH with SIB using a new Hybrid technique is a clinically feasible technique with excellent initial result."
"Samanta, S., et al.",2019,Concurrent External Thermal Therapy and Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy or Photon/Electron Therapy for Recurrent Breast Cancer: Early Outcomes and Toxicity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The combination of external thermal therapy (ETT) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for the treatment of patients with recurrent breast cancer is efficacious and well-tolerated. Traditionally, this has been accomplished with photon and/or electron radiation techniques. While pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBS-PT) may reduce dose to critical nearby organs, concern has arisen for a higher rate of acute skin toxicity due to reduced skin sparing with particle therapy. We hypothesized that acute/subacute toxicity, local control, and overall survival in women undergoing reirradiation with EBRT via PBS-PT or electron/photon (E/PRT) would be similar in patients treated for recurrent breast cancer. Materials/Methods: We evaluated women with recurrent breast cancer treated with EBRT+ETT between the years 2014 - 2018. Forty women with 41 treated lesions met inclusion criteria, of which 22 (55%) were white and 16 (40%) black. Median age was 63 years (range 34-93), 14 (35%) patients were metastatic at diagnosis and 10 (25%) patients received treatment with PBS-PT. Median RT dose was 50 Gy (range 20-70.2). Patients received a median of 10 ETT treatments (range, 2-18) usually given twice weekly to a goal temperature of 40-43 degrees Celsius for a duration of 45-60 minutes per session. Water bolus temperature was 39-40 degrees Celsius. Acute radiation dermatitis was assessed based on CTCAE 4.0. Chi-square was used to compare variables and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to calculate local control. Results: At a median follow up of 15 months for E/PRT and 17 months for PBS-PT, there were a total of 12 failures (39%) in the E/PRT group and 1 failures (10%) in the PBS-PT group (p=0.09). Median time to local failure was 15 mos vs. 22 mos for E/PRT and PBS-PT, respectively. One and 2-year local control (LC) was 51% and 36% vs. 88% and 88% in the E/PRT and PBS-PT groups, respectively (p=0.07). Acute grade ≥2 radiation dermatitis was present in 58% (n=18/31) vs. 50% (n=5/10) of patients receiving E/PRT and PBS-PT, respectively. There were no acute/subacute grade 4+ toxicities with either modality of EBRT+ETT. Conclusion: Our series demonstrates that women with recurrent breast cancer undergoing reirradiation with PBS-PT + ETT had similar rates of acute radiation dermatitis when compared to women undergoing reirradiation with E/PRT. Additionally, local control was excellent in this group with only one local failure, with a trend toward improved local control in PBS-PT compared to E/PRT. Larger numbers of patients and longer maturation of our results is warranted to evaluate outcomes and late toxicity in this challenging disease setting."
"Sanghvi, P. and Y. Tova",2010,Patient reported cosmesis after simultaneous integrated boost for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): In our practice, patients with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation therapy receive simultaneous integrated boosts (SIB) instead of sequential boosts (SqB) to the lumpectomy bed. This abstract describes patient reported cosmesis and our early local control results in women treated with SIB. Materials/Methods: A total of 235 women (237 breasts, 2 women with synchronous bilateral breast cancer) were treated with SIB between December 1, 2005 and June 30, 2009. All women were contacted in March 2010 and administered the RTOG Whole Breast Patient Cosmesis Questionnaire (PCQ). We also reviewed their most recent medical oncology and mammogram records to document any loco-regional and distant failures. A median dose of 50.4 Gy (Range: 45-50.4 Gy) was delivered in 25- 28 fractions (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) to the whole breast and a median dose of 7 Gy (15-40 c Gy per fraction) was delivered as SIB to the tumor bed. This allowed for patients to be treated over 51 1/2 weeks. Individual patient doses were determined at physician discretion. Results: There were 20 DCIS (8.4%), 164 T1 (69.1%) and 53 T2 (22.4%) patients. One hundred eighty-five women (78%) had N0 disease, 46 women (19.4%) had N+ disease and 7 women (3%) did not have nodal sampling. One hundred ninety-two women (81%) received either adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or both. One hundred ninety-one women (80.6%) had margins >2 mm, 41 women (17.3%) had margins <2 mm and 5 women (2.1%) had focally positive margins. One hundred ninety-seven women (83%) had ER+ tumors, 31 women (13.1%) had ER- tumors and 9 women (3.8%) did not have ER testing. Medical Oncology follow-up records and mammograms were reviewed on 173 and 162 women respectively. The median time to the most recent follow-up was 16.1 (1.9-44.7) months and mammogram was 15.6 (0.9-44.4) months after radiotherapy. There were no local or regional failures in the ipsilateral breast. Two women developed a metachronous contralateral breast cancer. One of these women underwent a bilateral mastectomy and the other woman underwent a mastectomy in the involved breast only. Three women developed metastatic disease and two of these women died from their disease. The median time to the PCQ follow-up was 21.4 months from the completion of their radiotherapy (8.7-51.5 months). One hundred eighty-eight women completed the survey (79.3%). Sixty-two point four percent of the women reported excellent or good cosmesis. 31% reported fair and 2.9% reported poor cosmesis. One hundred seventy-seven women (74.7%) were totally satisfied with the treatment and results. Conclusions: SIB is a reasonable alternative to sequential boost in women treated with breast conservation therapy. It allows for shortening the overall treatment time without compromising long term cosmesis. Loco-regional control is also comparable, although longer follow-up is needed."
"Santiago, R. J., et al.",2004,Fifteen-year results of breast-conserving surgery and definitive irradiation for Stage I and II breast carcinoma: The University of Pennsylvania experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the 15-year outcomes for women with early stage breast cancer after breast conservation therapy. Methods and Materials: Between 1977 and 1990, 937 women with Stage I and II breast carcinoma (55% T1N0, 16% T2N0, 18% T1N1, and 11% T2N1) underwent lumpectomy, axillary lymphadenectomy, and definitive irradiation. The median patient age was 52 years. Of the 937 patients, 375 (40%) received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, including 249 (92%) of the 270 women with pathologically positive nodes. The median follow-up was 10.1 years. Results: For the overall group, the 15-year overall survival rate was 71%, and the rate of freedom from distant metastases was 76%. The 15-year local failure rate was 19%. The 15-year contralateral breast cancer rate was 12%. The most common first events were distant failure (13%), local failure (10%), contralateral breast cancer (7%), and second malignant neoplasms (6%). The local failure rate at 10 years for favorable subsets of tumors characterized by mammographic detection, resection with negative margins, treatment with chemotherapy, and treatment with hormones was 8%, 10%, 10%, and 7%, respectively. Local failures were most commonly observed within (true recurrence), or just outside (marginal miss), the primary tumor bed (66%, 85 of 128). The rate of true recurrence or marginal miss at 5, 10, and 15 years was 5%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. Conclusion: These high rates of survival and local control confirm that breast conservation therapy yields favorable results in women with early breast cancer into the second decade after treatment.

"Sanz, J., et al.",2016,Whole-breast irradiation and hypofractionated boost in breast carcinoma: Multimodal chronic toxicity and cosmetic evaluations by objective tests.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): The aim of this study is to correlate chronic toxicity and multidimensional subjective/objective cosmetic evaluations in early stage breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery, whole breast hypofractionated irradiation, and hypofractionated sequential boost. Materials/Methods: From a series of 586 patients treated with hypofractionated whole breast irradiation, 50 patients with high dose hypofractionated boost were selected for exhaustive result evaluation. Patients were treated at a dose of 2.67 Gy/fr, 5 fractions at week, as far as 40 Gy and a sequential boost at the same hypofractionated doses, up to 56 Gy according to risk factors for local relapse. Patients were evaluated at minimum follow-up of 2 years for: a) chronic toxicity by means RTOG scale, b) subjective cosmetic assessment by Harvard scale, c) self-cosmetic assessment by means a 11 item questionnaire, that was considered gold standard for all comparisons, d) objective evaluation of skin pigmentation and fibrosis parameters (elasticity and hydration) by means a skin tester (Multi-Skin-Center ± MC-750-B2) and e) computer assisted photograph cosmetic and morphologic evaluations by BCCT-Core 2.0 software (UNESC, Porto University). Results: Median follow-up was 3.2 years (range: 2-4.4 years). There were no local relapses. All patients presented mild acute skin toxicity (22 patients grade I, 24 patients grade II). Chronic toxicity was present in 20 patients (17 patients grade I, 3 patients grade II). Elasticity and erythema measured by skin tester showed differences between patients with or without chronic toxicity ( P = 0.047 and P = 0.035 respectively). Patient cosmetic assessment resulted excellent in 26%, good in 64%, fair in 8% and bad in 2%. Overall score by photographic software correlated better to patient satisfaction than subjective physician evaluation (CC 0.36 vs 0.26; P = 0,016). The morphologic values on software assessment that best correlate with asymmetry perceived by patient were the BCE (Breast Compliance Evaluation) ( P = 0,018), pBRA (proportion Breast Retraction Assessment) ( P = 0,021) I pUNR (proportion Upward Nipple Retraction) ( P = 0,023). There was also a correlation between RTOG toxicity score and overall software cosmetic values ( P = 0,041). Conclusion: Hypofractionated boost is feasible with good results in terms of chronic toxicity and cosmesis. Outcomes seem best evaluated by objective tests."
"Sarin, R., et al.",1993,Therapeutic factors influencing the cosmetic outcome and late complications in the conservative management of early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To investigate the impact of clinical and physical parameters on the cosmetic result and complications, in cancer breast treated with conservative surgery and definitive irradiation. Methods and Materials: Between October 1980 and December 1990, 289 patients were treated with lumpectomy and/or axillary dissection, radical irradiation with or without adjuvant therapy. The radiation therapy technique consisted of external beam therapy followed by an Ir-192 implant or electron beam boost. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between multiple factors affecting the cosmetic outcome and the complications. Results: Of 289 patients, cosmesis was evaluable in 285 and recorded as excellent to good in 226 (79%), fair in 35 (12%), and poor in 24 (9%). On multivariate analysis of these results, a high dose per fraction (p = .0018), and use of electrons as boost to the tumor bed (p = .001) were found to be significant. When patients boosted with electrons were excluded, a high boost dose (p = .0433) was also found significant. Fifteen (5%) patients developed severe late radiation sequelae and 14 (5%) moderate or severe arm edema. On multivariate analysis only dose per fraction of 2.5 Gy (p < .0001) and higher boost doses (p = .017) were significant. Conclusion: In 289 patients of early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radical irradiation, multivariate analysis suggests that higher dose per fraction with teletherapy and higher brachytherapy boost dose adversely affect cosmesis and contribute to the late complications."
"Sauer, R., et al.",1992,Therapy of small breast cancer: A prospective study on 1036 patients with special emphasis on prognostic factors.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"In 1983, The German Breast Cancer Study Group, sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology, started a prospective multicenter trial on the treatment of early breast cancer pT1 pN0 M0. Treatment consisted of initial tumorectomy with microscopically free margins and lower axillary dissection. After conformation of a pT1 pN0-stage, additional treatment was either mastectomy or adjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions to the entire breast plus 12 Gy electron boost). In medially located tumors, the parasternal and supraclavicular area was also irradiated with 50 Gy. A randomization between both treatment modalities was initially planned but was not feasible and abandoned. Nearly all patients were treated according to their own choice. From November 1983 through December 1989, 1119 patients were recruited. Eighty-three were excluded from the protocol. Out of the remaining 1036 patients, 733 (71%) underwent breast preservation and 303 (29%) mastectomy. A detailed pathohistological examination of all tumorectomy specimens was performed in a pathologic reference center. Oncogen overexpression was evaluated by immunohistological detection of the transmembrane protein p-185 (corresponding to c-erb-B2) in 425 cases. After a median follow-up of 48 months, the frequency of local recurrences (4.7%), regional recurrences (1%), and distant metastases (5.4%) was the same in the breast preservation group and the mastectomy group. The 3-year disease-free survival was 90% after breast preservation and 88% after mastectomy (p = 0.21). In the breast preserving group, 24 patients with microscopically involved margins had a poorer disease-free survival than the study group (75% vs 90% after 3 years). The width of the margins had no impact on prognosis. Other prognostic factors in an univariate and multivariate analysis were tumor size and tumor grade. Age, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, histological tumor type, and treatment (mastectomy vs breast preservation) were not significant. P-185-expression was dependent on tumor grade and was the strongest prognostic factor in an univariate and multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). The results emphasize the central role of tumor grade for prognosis and suggest the independent prognostic significance of the c-erb-B2 oncogen (corresponding to p-185) in pN0-patients."
"Sayan, M., et al.",2016,A novel schedule of accelerated partial breast radiation using intensity modulated radiation therapy in elderly patients: Survival and toxicity analysis of a prospective clinical trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast radiation (APBR) has been proposed as an alternative to whole breast radiation in a selected population of early stage breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS). The optimal techniques for APBR remain controversial partly because of the long term toxicity and cosmetic outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of APBR delivered using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the lumpectomy cavity of elderly patients with stage I invasive ductal carcinoma, using a novel fractionation schedule. Materials/Methods: Forty-two patients aged 65 with Stage T1N0M0 breast cancer who underwent BCS were enrolled between June 2006 and May 2013 into a Phase I/II study evaluating APBR using IMRT. Forty patients received 40 Gy in 4 Gy daily fractions. Treatment related toxicities and cosmesis were evaluated by both the treating physician and the patients before APBR, at 6 months, and yearly after for 5 years. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate actuarial rates of locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS). Results: The median age was 73 years (range, 65 e 88). The median follow-up was 54 months. The 5-year LRC rate was 97.5% and the OS rate was 90%. One patient developed a new breast cancer in the same quadrant with a different histology. Erythema and skin pigmentation was the most commonly reported acute adverse event, noted by 27 (69%) patients. Breast edema and subcutaneous toxicities during treatment were reported by 24 (61.5%) and 20 (51%) patients, respectively. Patient reported late effects were as follows: 23 (59%) contour defect, 13 (33%) subcutaneous toxicities, 9 (23%) pigmentation changes and dry desquamation, and 3 (8%) breast edema. The physician reported late effects were: volume loss 31 (84%), subcutaneous toxicities 26 (70%) patients, and breast edema 11 (30%). The patient and physician reported late toxicities were mostly Grade 1 and 2. Patient reported grade 3 toxicity was: 1 (3%) edema, 4 (10%) subcutaneous toxicities, and 5 (13%) contour defect. During the treatment 26 (65%) patients reported mild pain, rating 1-4/10, and 3 (7.5%) pain rate of 5. Long term 67% -85% of patients reported no pain. Long term pain 5 was reported in 5 patients. Over the follow up period 87% -93% of patients and 86% -100% of physicians scored the overall cosmesis as excellent or good. Conclusion: In this prospective trial with 54 months median follow-up, we observed an excellent tumor control rate with APBR. Furthermore, the acceptable toxicity profile and cosmetic results of this study support the use of IMRT planned APBR to a dose of 40 Gy in daily 4 Gy fractions."
"Schnitt, S. J., et al.",1985,"Breast relapse following primary radiation therapy for early breast cancer. II. Detection, pathologic features and prognostic significance.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"In order to define better the nature of breast relapse following primary radiation therapy for early-stage invasive breast cancer, we examined the clinical patterns, methods of detection, histopathology and prognosis in 25 patients. Eighty-eight percent of these relapses occurred in the vicinity of the original tumor at an average of 33 months after treatment. Twelve percent occurred in a location distinctly separate from the primary tumor area at an average of 75 months after treatment. In 14 patients breast relapse was detected by physical examination (PE) alone, in 6 patients by mammography alone and in 5 patients by both. In eight of the patients whose relapses were detected by PE alone, mammography was not performed; mammograms were negative in the other six. In 89% of the patients who presented with a new abnormality on physical examination, the recurrence consisted predominantly or exclusively of invasive carcinoma. In contrast, in all six patients who presented with only a new mammographic abnormality, the recurrence consisted predominantly or exclusively of intraductal carcinoma. Eighteen of these patients underwent salvage mastectomy, 3 were inoperable on clinical grounds and 4 refused mastectomy. Only 1 of the 18 patients who underwent mastectomy had a significant complication related to the surgery. Twenty-one of these 25 patients (84%) are alive without further recurrence up to 67 months (mean 24 months) after breast relapse. We conclude that (1) physical examination and mammography are both important for the detection of breast relapses: (2) secondary (salvage) surgery can be performed without significant complications; and (3) a breast relapse does not have the same grave prognosis as a local (chest wall) recurrence after mastectomy."
"Schuster, J. M., et al.",2015,Noninvasive breast brachytherapy boost: Cosmesis and tumor control.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate cosmesis and tumor control results after high dose rate (HDR) noninvasive breast brachytherapy (NIBB) for tumor bed boost in combination with whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) for breast cancer in patients with a minimum reported follow-up of 1 year. Materials/Methods: Seventeen participating centers logged 518 patients on a privacy-encrypted online data registry. Patients had early stage breast cancer and completed HDR Ir192 breast boost using NIBB in combination with WBRT after breast conserving surgery (BCS) from July 2007 to December 2014. Recorded information included patient, tumor and treatment characteristics, as well as toxicity, cosmesis, and recurrence data. This report focuses on patients with one year minimum follow-up (n=163). Results: Median follow-up was 23.5 months (12-75 months) and median age was 59 (range 19-87). Average tumor size was 1.5 +/- 1.07cm with histologies of invasive ductal (61%), DCIS (24%), and invasive lobular (9%). Reported treatment technique included average boost dose 10.6 +/- 3.4 Gy, utilizing clips for tumor bed identification 71% and having skin flash 34%. There were 4 reported recurrences; 2 were ipsilateral breast, but only one was within the boost volume. Entire cohort had freedom from any recurrence of 97%. Excellent or good (E/G) cosmesis at last follow-up was 96.9% with 4 (2.5%) fair and 1 (0.6%) poor. E/G cosmetic results were not statistically different between patients that received boost treatment before (93%), during (95%), or after (97%) WBRT. Analysis by increasing follow-up length showed trend for preserved cosmetic results, E/G cosmesis for patients with > 24 month follow-up (n=63) was 95%, > 36 months (n=32) was 100%, and > 48 months (n=16) was 100%. Although academic centers more commonly had patients with >1 year follow-up (70%) data entered, there was no difference between E/G cosmetic rates 95% reported at academic centers vs. 96% at community centers. Conclusion: NIBB has previously been reported as a feasible alternative method to delivery breast tumor cavity boost that improves set-up reproducibility through elimination of respiratory motion and daily mammographic tumor cavity identification. This report reviewed patient outcomes with minimum of 1 year follow-up to provide valuable updated information demonstrating preserved favorable cosmetic outcome and low rates of recurrence. There was no trend for worse cosmesis or recurrence between academic and community-based practices."
"Schutzer, M. E., et al.",2014,Time driven activity-based costing: An economic analysis of whole-breast radiation therapy versus balloon-based brachytherapy in the management of early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Value in healthcare is defined as the health outcomes achieved per dollar spent, and a detailed understanding of cost is therefore of critical importance in delivering high value care. Traditional costing methods that utilize ratio of cost to charges or relative value units cannot reliably estimate the true cost to provide a service. In this analysis, the more rigorous method of time driven activity based costing (TDABC) is used to compare the cost of whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) with balloon-based brachytherapy (BT) for early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: For both WBRT (25 fractions with 5 fraction boost) and BT (10 fractions twice daily), process maps were created outlining each activity required for treatment delivery from the time of initial consult until the first follow-up after treatment. Through a combination of interviews with staff and workflow tracking, time estimates were obtained for each activity. The capacity cost rate (CCR), defined as cost per minute, was calculated for all involved personnel, equipment, and physical space. For personnel, this was based on average salary, supervision costs, and benefits cost per available clinical work time. For equipment and space, this was based on depreciation and maintenance costs per available time. To calculate total cost, the total time required of each resource was multiplied by the CCR for that resource. This was then summed, and combined with cost of materials. Comparative analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Results: Total cost for BT was 41% more than for WBRT. Personnel cost was 17% higher, and space/equipment cost was 39% lower for BT compared to WBRT. The total cost for BT comprised 48% personnel costs, 18% space and equipment costs, and 34% materials costs. For WBRT, the total cost comprised 57% personnel costs and 43% space and equipment costs. The attending physician had the highest CCR of all personnel, and BT required 24% more attending time than WBRT. The most expensive activity for BT was balloon placement and for WBRT was CT simulation. The CCR for the linear accelerator was 3.5 times higher than that of the high dose rate afterloader. Conclusions: Based on TDABC methodology, BT was found to cost more than WBRT when using our departmental procedures and the dose and fractionation schemes analyzed in this study. As shorter courses of BT become established, it will likely become more cost effective in comparison to WBRT. It is feasible to conduct TDABC analysis to evaluate the cost of various treatment techniques in the field of radiation oncology. Future research should employ this method to improve our understanding of cost with the ultimate goal to identify cost reduction strategies and to provide a point of reference from which bundled payments can be defined."
"Schytte, T., et al.",2019,Feasibility of Actinic Castration Treatment in Breast Cancer Patients Using MR Guided External Radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Treatment on magnetic resonance linear accelerators (MRL) is increasingly used. Yet, it is still to be decided which patients will benefit in terms of reduced side effects without compromising the effect on target. Endocrine treatment is part of the adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer patient with estrogen positive tumors. For some of these patients suppression of the ovarian function is mandatory before using aromatase inhibitor. Actinic castration is an alternative. However, the ovaries are difficult to visualize on a CT and cone beam CT scan and their position can vary from day to day, even within minutes due to bowel motion. In order to ensure target coverage the whole pelvic area has typically been irradiated to 15 Gy/ 5 F on non-MR accelerators. These patients may benefit from treatment on MRL since it is possible to visualize the ovaries on MR-scans and, hence and, hence, possible to treat the ovaries only. Materials/Methods: Treatment on MRL was initialized in our institution in Oct. 2018. Actinic castration on the MRL has been performed on three patients. For each patient two treatment plans were created: An ovary only plan that was delivered on the MRL and a whole pelvic area plan for delivery on a non-MR accelerator. Each patient was scored for acute side effects prior radiotherapy, after the last treatment fraction, and 2 weeks following. The fractionation has been changed to 15 Gy/ 3 fractions on the MRL since the treated volume has been reduced considerable. Results: The treatment volumes and dose to selected organs at risk were noticeably lower for MRL treatment than it would have been on a non-MR accelerator (Table 1). There was a considerable day-to-day movement of the ovaries, and in one treatment session the ovaries moved substantially during the planning of the day. Re-contouring of the ovaries was therefore necessary at each fraction. The median treatment fraction time (patient into to patient out of the room) was 40 min (37-46 min). A median time of 12 min (7-17 min) was spent on re-contouring. None of the patients complained about being in the MRL, and they found that treatment time was acceptable. No grad 2+ toxicity was observed in the three patients. One patient had minor pain in the abdomen after first fraction, and experienced mild headache and nausea 2 weeks after treatment. Data on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are awaited. [Figure presented] Conclusion: Breast cancer patients planned for actinic castration are candidates for treatment on MRL since the treatment volume is considerably reduced, although the treatment time per fraction is increased. The reduced irradiated volume at the MRL resulted in reduced fraction number from five to three."
"Sekine, H., et al.",2012,Virtual computer simulation of skin erythema during and after breast conserving therapy using generalized LQ model.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to display skin erythema during and after breast conserving therapy using generalized LQ (GLQ) model. GLQ model includes not only interfraction interval, but also time after irradiation. This model can express both division cell death and apoptotic cell death. Materials/Methods: Seventy-one of early breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery, who were planned post-operative radiation therapy, were enrolled to this study. Radiation therapy was delivered tangentially non-coplanar method in 2 Gy/fr with 4 -6MV photon beams, 5 fr/w until 50 Gy, and some patients were given boost irradiation around operation scar. Quantitative measurements of radiation induced skin erythema have been detected using by reflectance spectrophotometer every week until the end of the radiation course. Follow up time after the therapy is 2weeks, 1 month and every three months thereafter. Measured color is expressed by 3-dimentional factors using L∗a∗b∗: L∗ indicates lightness and a∗ and b∗ are chromaticity coordinates. For the computer simulation, L∗a∗b∗ values were converted to HSB (H: Hue, S: Saturation, and B: Brightness) values. The coefficients of α, β, and T1/2 (response half time) are estimated by non-linear regression analysis of dose-effect plots of H, S, and B, respectively. By the assumption that skin erythema will recover until three months after radiation therapy, repair half time of skin erythema is obtained by iterative calculation. Accumulated doses were projected on time scale. GLQ models of each H, S, and B parameters according to breast size simulate the appearance of skin erythema during and after irradiation on the 3D breast graphic model. Results: Nonlinear regression curve of 1/S produced by fitting of inverted S data, because S was increased according to dose accumulation. Reinversion of this curve induced regression curve of S. Nonlinear regression coefficients of alpha/beta of each H, 1/S, and B were shown as follows (H: 2.63, 1/S: 2.21, and B: 2.42), and decay half time = 12 days, recovery doubling time =15 days.

"Senthi, S., et al.",2012,Cosmetic outcome and seroma formation after breast-conserving surgery with intraoperative radiation therapy boost for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate cosmetic outcome and its association with breast wound seroma after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with targeted intraoperative radiation therapy (tIORT) boost for early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: An analysis of a single-arm prospective study of 55 patients with early breast cancer treated with BCS and tIORT boost followed by conventional whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) between August 2003 and January 2006 was performed. A seroma was defined as a fluid collection at the primary tumor resection site identified clinically or radiologically. Cosmetic assessments using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer rating system were performed at baseline before BCS and 30 months after WBRT was completed. Results: Twenty-eight patients (51%) developed a seroma, with 18 patients (33%) requiring at least 1 aspiration. Tumor location was significantly associated with seroma formation (P=.001). Ten of 11 patients with an upper inner quadrant tumor developed a seroma. Excellent or good overall cosmetic outcome at 30 months was observed in 34 patients (62%, 95% confidence interval 53%-80%). Seroma formation was not associated with the overall cosmetic result (P=.54). Conclusion: BCS with tIORT boost followed by WBRT was associated with an acceptable cosmetic outcome. Seroma formation was not significantly associated with an adverse cosmetic outcome.  Inc."
"Sevak, P. R., et al.",2015,Dosimetric and clinical outcomes with use of a breast cup in cancer patients with large or pendulous breasts.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy is the standard of care for early stage breast cancer. This can be challenging for Radiation Oncologists treating patients with large (>1300 cc or > D cup) and/or pendulous breasts. Immobilization of the breast in these women are especially important thus alternative positions for radiation have been proposed including the prone position, aquaplast for immobilization, or a bra. Irradiation of large or pendulous breasts can lead to more acute and late toxicity because of increased inhomogeneity. We report our experience using a breast cup in large volume breast patients and its effect on acute toxicity and heart and lung dosimetry. Materials/Methods: 47 breast cancer patients with large or pendulous breasts (443-3736cc, median 2000cc) were treated between 2010 and 2014. 34 patients (72%) were treated to the left breast and 13 (28%) to the right breast using a breast cup (CIVCO Medical Solutions). 31 patients (66%) were African American, 14 patients (30%) were white. Mean age was 65 (range 45-88). On average patients had a mean BMI of 36.28. Mean chest wall separation was 25cm (range 16-34.8 cm). 89% were treated using an electronic tissue compensation technique and 11% were treated using a 3D field-in-field technique to a median dose of 45 Gy (range 40.05-50 Gy in 1.8-2.67 Gy) to the whole breast followed by a boost of 10-16.2 Gy. 4 patients received a hypofractionated regimen. Dosimetry was obtained for lung dose, heart dose, and contralateral breast dose. Clinical outcomes were obtained from retrospective chart review. Comparisons were made to patients in the Michigan Radiation Oncology Quality Consortium (MROQC), a statewide assessment of breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy and crude rates were used for comparisons. Results: For left sided cancers, mean heart dose was 3.09 Gy. The use of a breast cup resulted in mean V20 for lung of 5.6% and V5 of 11%. Mean dose to the contralateral breast was 3.29 Gy. Twenty patients (42.5%) experienced grade 2 skin toxicity; one patient (2.1%) experienced a grade 3 skin toxicity. Moist desquamation rates: 44.7% compared to 45.5% MROQC. Moist desquamation for patients with a BMI >35 was 52.2% vs 42.8% MROQC. For a breast volume >1550cc, moist desquamation was seen in 48.6% vs 45.5% MROQC. Conclusion: Our results indicate that use of the breast cup can allow for improved dose homogeneity with similar acute toxicities as compared with patients treated without the cup while minimizing the dose to the heart and lungs. Our clinical experience shows that breast cups can be used with ease, and allow for good setup reproducibility. It appears that the slight increase in moist desquamation was associated with increased BMI. In conclusion, we recommend that use of a breast cup be considered in appropriately selected patients with large or pendulous breasts."
"Shah, C., et al.",2012,Impact of lymph node status on clinical outcomes after accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare outcomes after accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) between node-negative and node-positive patients. Methods and Materials: A total of 534 patients with early-stage breast cancer received APBI including 39 node-positive (N+) cases. Clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related factors were compared between node-negative (N-) and N+ cohorts. Local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), axillary failure (AF), distant metastases (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: N+ patients were younger (p = 0.04), had larger tumors (p < 0.001), and were more likely to receive chemotherapy (p < 0.001). Mean follow-up was 7.8 years for N+ patients and 6.3 years for N- patients (p = 0.06). No differences were seen in 5-year actuarial rates of LR (2.2% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.86), AF (0% vs. 0%, p = 0.69), DFS (90.0% vs. 88.0%, p = 0.79), or OS (91.0 vs. 84.0%, p = 0.65) between the two groups, whereas higher rates of RR (0% vs. 6.1%, p < 0.001) and DM (2.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.005) were noted in N+ patients. A trend for improved CSS (p = 0.06), was seen in N- patients. Age, tumor size, receptor status, T-stage, chemotherapy, APBI technique, and nodal status (p = 0.86) were not associated with LR, while a trend for an association with LR was noted with close/positive margins, (p = 0.07), and failure to receive adjuvant hormonal therapy (p = 0.06). Conclusions: No differences were seen in the rates of LR or AF between N- and N+ patients after APBI. These results support the continued enrollment of node-positive patients in Phase III trials evaluating the efficacy of APBI including the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project-B39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413.

"Shank, B., et al.",2000,The 1993-94 patterns of care process survey for breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery - Comparison with the 1992 standard for breast conservation treatment.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the patterns of evaluation and treatment in the U.S. of women with early breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and irradiation in 1993-94, and to compare these with a similar survey in 1983 and with the 1992 Standard for Breast Conservation Treatment.Methods and Materials: In 1995-96, 727 randomly selected records of eligible patients treated from 1993-94 at 62 facilities representative of 3 practice types were reviewed.Results: Compared with the Process Survey (PS) in 1983, patients in the 1993-94 study had an older age distribution. In the current study, 70% of patients were ≥ 50 years of age, and 69% were post-menopausal, compared with 59% ≥ 50 years of age and 49% post-menopausal in 1983 (p = 0.0087 and < 0.001, respectively). Work-up and evaluation in the 1993-94 PS were closely aligned with the standard and were considerably improved compared with 1983. In the 1983 study, 77% of patients underwent mammography, as compared to 97% in the 1993-94 study. In 1983, pathological size documentation was performed in 83% of patients; in 1993-94, this was performed in 95% of patients. An estrogen receptor evaluation was performed in 36% of patients in 1983; in 1993-94, that increased to 76%. In 1983, 28% of patients underwent progesterone receptor evaluation; in 1993-94, this increased to 72%. Only 3% of patients in 1993-94 were enrolled in a clinical trial. Radiation treatment parameters closely adhered to standard recommendations, improving substantially from 1983. In 1983, wedge or compensator use was recommended for 64% of patients; in 1993-94, for 95% of patients. In 1983, 4-8 MV photons were recommended for breast treatment in 67% of patients; in 1993-94, 90%. In 1983, bolus was avoided in 75% of patients; in 1993-94, in 94%. In 1983, the recommended breast dose for 89% of patients was 45-50 Gy (44-51 Gy in PS); in 1993-94 this had increased to 99% of patients. In 1983, electrons were recommended for primary site boost in 70% of patients; in 1993-94, for 94% of patients.Conclusion: There was an extensive shift to adherence to the 1992 standard in 1993-94, compared with the 1983 PS, although there is room for improvement in some areas.

"Sher, D. J., et al.",2009,Partial-Breast Irradiation Versus Whole-Breast Irradiation for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (PBI) is a new treatment paradigm for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Although PBI may lead to greater local recurrence rates, it may be cost-effective because of better tolerability and lower cost. We aim to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of PBI compared with whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) for estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal women treated for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: We developed a Markov model to describe health states in the 15 years after radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. External beam (EB) and MammoSite (MS) PBI were considered and assumed to be equally effective, but carried different costs. Patients received tamoxifen, but not chemotherapy. Utilities, recurrence risks, and costs were adapted from the literature; the baseline utility for no disease after radiotherapy was set at 0.92. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in the PBI hazard ratio, recurrence pattern, and patient utilities. Costs (in 2004 US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years were discounted at 3%/y. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for WBRT compared with EB-PBI was $630,000/quality-adjusted life-year; WBRT strongly dominated MS-PBI. One-way sensitivity analysis found that results were sensitive to PBI hazard ratio, recurrence pattern, baseline recurrence risk, and no evidence of disease PBI utility values. Probabilistic sensitivity showed that EB-PBI was the most cost-effective technique over a wide range of assumptions and societal willingness-to-pay values. Conclusions: EB-PBI was the most cost-effective strategy for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Unless the quality of life after MS-PBI proves to be superior, it is unlikely to be cost-effective.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Sher, D. J., et al.",2008,Partial Breast Irradiation Versus Whole Breast Radiotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Decision Analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare the quality-adjusted life expectancy between women treated with partial breast irradiation (PBI) vs. whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) for estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: We developed a Markov model to describe health states in the 15 years after radiotherapy for estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer. Breast cancer recurrences were separated into local recurrences and elsewhere failures. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) risk was extracted from the Oxford overview, and rates and utilities were adapted from the literature. We studied two cohorts of women (aged 40 and 55 years), both of whom received adjuvant tamoxifen. Results: Assuming a no evidence of disease (NED)-PBI utility of 0.93, quality-adusted life expectancy after PBI (and WBRT) was 12.61 (12.57) and 12.10 (12.06) years for 40-year-old and 55-year-old women, respectively. The NED-PBI utility thresholds for preferring PBI over WBRT were 0.923 and 0.921 for 40-year-old and 55-year-old women, respectively, both slightly greater than the NED-WBRT utility. Outcomes were sensitive to the utility of NED-PBI, the PBI hazard ratio for local recurrence, the baseline IBTR risk, and the percentage of IBTRs that were local. Overall the degree of superiority of PBI over WBRT was greater for 55-year-old women than for 40-year-old women. Conclusions: For most utility values of the NED-PBI health state, PBI was the preferred treatment modality. This result was highly sensitive to patient preferences and was also dependent on patient age, PBI efficacy, IBTR risk, and the fraction of IBTRs that were local.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Shirvani, S. M., et al.",2016,Trends in local therapy utilization and cost for early-stage breast cancer in older women: Implications for payment and policy reform.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose Older women with early-stage disease constitute the most rapidly growing breast cancer demographic, yet it is not known which local therapy strategies are most favored by this population in the current era. Understanding utilization trends and cost of local therapy is important for informing the design of bundled payment models as payers migrate away from fee-for-service models. We therefore used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare database to determine patterns of care and costs for local therapy among older women with breast cancer. Methods and Materials Treatment strategy and covariables were determined in 55,327 women age ≥66 with Tis-T2N0-1M0 breast cancer who underwent local therapy between 2000 and 2008. Trends in local therapy were characterized using Joinpoint. Polychotomous logistic regression determined predictors of local therapy. The median aggregate cost over the first 24 months after diagnosis was determined from Medicare claims through 2010 and reported in 2014 dollars. Results The median age was 75. Local therapy distribution was as follows: 27,896 (50.3%) lumpectomy with external beam radiation, 18,356 (33.1%) mastectomy alone, 6159 (11.1%) lumpectomy alone, 1488 (2.7%) mastectomy with reconstruction, and 1455 (2.6%) lumpectomy with brachytherapy. Mastectomy alone declined from 39.0% in 2000 to 28.2% in 2008, and the use of breast conserving local therapies rose from 58.7% to 68.2%. Mastectomy with reconstruction was more common among the youngest, healthiest patients, whereas mastectomy alone was more common among patients living in rural low-income regions. By 2008, the costs were $36,749 for lumpectomy with brachytherapy, $35,030 for mastectomy with reconstruction, $31,388 for lumpectomy with external beam radiation, $21,993 for mastectomy alone, and $19,287 for lumpectomy alone. Conclusions The use of mastectomy alone in older women declined in favor of breast conserving strategies between 2000 and 2008. Using these cost estimates, price points for local therapy bundles can be constructed to incentivize the treatment strategies that confer the highest value."
"Simone, B., et al.",2013,Evaluation of treatment planning modalities for early stage left-sided breast cancers reveals deep inspiration breath hold comes out on top.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): As breast cancer survivorship continues to increase, the need to minimize long term side effects of radiation such as heart disease and lung fibrosis becomes more pertinent. Respiratoryinduced heart and lung motion in whole breast irradiation (WBI) can lead to changes in dose distribution across target volumes. Therefore, we sought to compare dosimetric variance using four different treatment schemes: 4DCT average intensity projection (AVEIP), 4DCT maximal intensity projection (MIP), deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) and prone breast setup. Materials/Methods: Patients with left sided early stage breast cancer, planned to undergo WBI to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions using tangents without nodal radiation were retrospectively selected. During the time of simulation, the patients were positioned in the supine position to acquire both a 3DCT during DIBH and a 4DCT acquired during free breathing, and in the prone position for a 3DCT. Contours were delineated on the prone, DIBH, all 10-phases of the 4D, the AVEIP and the MIP. The whole breast, ipsilateral (IPSL) and contralateral lungs (CTRL) and heart were contoured. IPSL dosage was analyzed using Dmean, and the volume receiving ≥ 5, 10 or 20 Gy. CTRL dosage was evaluated for volume receiving ≥ 5 Gy. Heart dosage was evaluated using Dmean and the volume receiving ≥ 5, 10 or 15 Gy. Results: Sixteen separate plans were analyzed. Analysis of 4D volumes showed no variation for MIP and AVEIP, while two distinct phases of end inspiration and end inspiration could be identified based on volumetric changes in each patient. Analysis of 4D data was done by combining values obtained from both MIP and AVEIP as they were comparable. Plans using DIBH and 4DCT had greater breast volume coverage when compared with prone setup; V50 Gy for DIBH, 4DCT and prone were 77.1% +/- 1.68, 79.3% +/- 5.07 and 68.7% +/- 0.90 respectively (p = 0.03). Prone setup significantly reduced the Dmean to IPSL: 60 cGy +/- 13 compared with 425 cGy +/- 43.7 for DIBH and 452 cGy +/-65.5 for 4DCT (p < 0.01). IPSL V20 Gy was significantly decreased with prone setup at 0.40% +/- 0.1 as compared with 6.95% +/- 0.6 for DIBH and 7.18% +/- 1.8 for 4DCT (p = 0.003). In analyzing V5 Gy to the heart, DIBH had significantly less tissue receiving 5 Gy at 0.6% +/- 0.3, while prone setup was 5.28% +/- 0.1 and 4DCT was 3.49% +/- 0.4 (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Plans devised for both prone breast and DIBH provided a benefit to normal tissue dose as seen in treatment planning. Prone breast radiation minimized lung toxicity however; whole breast coverage was not optimal. DIBH minimized heart dose while allowing for optimal whole breast coverage. From this dosimetric evaluation, the role of 4DCT is unclear and DIBH may be optimal for early stage left sided breast cancers if it is tolerated by the patient."
"Sittig, M., et al.",2015,Patient reported cosmesis following accelerated partial-breast irradiation using intensity modulated radiation therapy: A single-institution experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is one of a number of methods of delivering accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Patient satisfaction regarding cosmesis following APBI using other technologies including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and applicator-based APBI is well-described in the literature, but to date, the authors know of no study that has examined patient satisfaction following intensity modulated APBI (IM-APBI). This study was performed to investigate patient satisfaction with cosmesis using this technique. Materials/Methods: After review board approval, patient charts and radiation therapy plans were reviewed at a single radiation oncology facility. Study eligibility included age >45 years with Stage I disease treated using IM-APBI between 2007 and 2012. The prescribed dose (range: 34-37.5 Gy) was delivered in ten BID fractions over five days. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined by the seroma cavity, post-operative changes, and surgical clips, when available. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined by the GTV + 1.5cm and limited by 0.5cm from the skin and chest wall. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the CTV with a 1.0 cm margin. A telephone script was developed for patient assessment of the treated breast, including changes to skin, breast size, and post-treatment complications. Patients were also asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the appearance of the treated breast compared to the untreated breast, consistent with the four-point Harvard Breast Cosmesis Grading Scale but framed in patient-oriented language. Additionally, clinical endpoints including local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were collected. Results: Fifty-two patients underwent IM-APBI without breath holding following partial mastectomy. Thirty-seven eligible patients (71%) were reached by telephone and agreed to participate in the survey. Of participating patients, 3 (8%) and 1 (3%) reported skin hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, respectively. Five patients (13%) reported skin thickening after treatment, and seven (19%) reported decreased breast size following radiation therapy. Overall satisfaction with appearance of the treated breast after completion of therapy was very high, with 35 patients (95%) reporting either “excellent” or “good” cosmesis, defined at a median follow-up of 37 months. Only two patients (5%) reported “fair” cosmesis when surveyed. Local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were all 100% at follow-up. Conclusion: Intensity modulated APBI represents a safe and cosmetically acceptable means of delivering adjuvant radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. As with adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy using IMRT, intensity modulated radiation may offer an improved cosmetic outcome as compared to the 3D conformal-based technique."
"Sittig, M., et al.",2016,Does prior breast augmentation negatively impact the dosimetry of brachytherapy-delivered accelerated partial breast irradiation?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) utilizing brachytherapy has become an increasingly important method of delivering adjuvant radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery for selected patients. However, data regarding the suitability of implanted strut-based catheters in patients with prior breast augmentation is limited. The purpose of this study is to describe the dosimetric parameters and identify the challenges of delivering APBI for patients with prior breast augmentation treated with a strut-based catheter for early-stage breast cancer, and compare these data with national APBI guidelines. Materials/Methods: Medical charts and radiotherapy plans were reviewed for patients with prior breast augmentation who underwent high dose rate (HDR) APBI using a multi-lumen strut-based catheter device. Data examined included pathologic stage, tumor location (breast quadrant, laterality), lumpectomy cavity volume, number of HDR catheter channels used, prescription dose, catheter central-axis-to-skin distance, maximum doses to lung, heart, and skin, percentage of planning treatment volume receiving 90% of the dose (V90-PTV) and volume receiving 100%, 150% and 200% of the prescription dose (V100, V150, V200, respectively). The dose homogeneity index (DHI) was calculated as (1-V150/V100). These data were then compared to the dosimetric guidelines as described in the RTOG 0413/NSABP-B39 APBI protocol. Results: Five patients with previously augmented breasts who underwent HDR APBI utilizing a strut-based catheter were identified. Eighty percent (4/5) had left-sided tumors. Median tumor size was 1.6 cm (range: 0.9 -2.3 cm). Lesion locations were three upper-outer, one upper-inner, and one lower-inner. Two patients required a single channel, while the remaining patients each used 2, 3, or 5 channels. Radiation activity delivered as measured in curie-seconds ranged from 628.5 to 1460.4. The median V90-PTV was 90.6% (range: 44.6 e 98.9%), while the V150% and V200% were 22.97 cm3 and 14.08 cm3, respectively. The maximum skin dose ranged from 92% -151% of the prescription dose (34 Gy). The median DHI was 0.46 (range: 0.45 e 0.50). Conclusion: When compared with the RTOG 0413/NSABP B-39 guidelines for HDR brachytherapy-based APBI, we found considerable variability in the PTV coverage and maximum skin dose. DHI was lower than published guidelines, likely due to the presence of the breast implant adjacent to the catheter. Maximum heart and lung doses were within constraints. Our findings emphasize that for women with prior breast augmentation, pursuing breast-conserving therapy with adjuvant strutbased catheter APBI presents unique challenges. In particular, the unusual geometry of the breast tissue in augmented breasts may require prioritization of normal tissues, which may lead to decreased PTV coverage. As such, our study highlights the need for careful pre-treatment evaluation and consideration of dosimetric parameters in this unique patient population."
"Skowronek, J., et al.",2011,Perioperative brachytherapy as the boost before external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in breast-conserving surgery of T1-T2 breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiotherapy (RT) has become the standard treatment for the majority of patients with early breast cancer. Most of this patients are treated with HDR technique after EBRT.We present our clinical observations of HDR brachytherapy as a boost using applications made during BCS in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Between July 2008 and December 2009, a total of 96 female patients with stage I to II breast cancer underwent BCT. The mean age was 54.2 years (30 - 77). This therapeutic procedure consisted of a BCS, HDR-BT boost using interstitial flexible implant tubes and whole breast irradiation (WBRT). Single, double and triple plan implant in 6, 44, and 46 cases respectively with a external template were used. The next day after surgery one fraction of 10 Gy HDR brachytherapy was administered. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) on the whole breast started between 12-32 days (mean 19 days). The prescribed dose was 42.5 Gy.We analyzed early cosmetic effect (RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema) in comparison with chosen prognostic and dosimetric factors. We analyzed also technical feasibility of this technique. Results: At a median follow-up of 14 months none of the women had developed in-field breast recurrences, one patient had outof- field recurrence and one patient presented distant metastases. There were no regional nodal recurrences. In each woman, target volume size in cm3 (median 91.3 cm3), dose volume histogram (DVH), and dose homogeneity index (DHI) were calculated. Median DHI was 0.42. Median volume of breast tissue receiving 100% of the prescription dos, V100 was 87%; and V150 - 48.5%. We noticed two treatment complications: hematoma and abscess in the place of the tumor bed after extirpation. Cosmetic appearance ranged from very good to excellent. Conclusions:We confirm that perioperative brachytherapy was a very good method to avoid local recurrence in breast carcinoma, maybe due to the exact placement of the applicators on the bed tumor. This method is suitable only for patients with histologically confirmed small tumors (<3 cm in diameter) without negative prognostic factors for local recurrence. A dose of 10 Gy was well tolerated with no surgical complications. Dosimetric constraints were acceptable. It seems that cosmetic effect was satisfactory in the majority of patients."
"Smith, B. D., et al.",2011,Fractionation for whole breast irradiation: An American society for radiation oncology (ASTRO) evidence-based guideline.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: In patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery, randomized trials have found little difference in local control and survival outcomes between patients treated with conventionally fractionated (CF-) whole breast irradiation (WBI) and those receiving hypofractionated (HF)-WBI. However, it remains controversial whether these results apply to all subgroups of patients. We therefore developed an evidence-based guideline to provide direction for clinical practice. Methods and Materials: A task force authorized by the American Society for Radiation Oncology weighed evidence from a systematic literature review and produced the recommendations contained herein. Results: The majority of patients in randomized trials were aged 50 years or older, had disease Stage pT1-2 pN0, did not receive chemotherapy, and were treated with a radiation dose homogeneity within ±7% in the central axis plane. Such patients experienced equivalent outcomes with either HF-WBI or CF-WBI. Patients not meeting these criteria were relatively underrepresented, and few of the trials reported subgroup analyses. For patients not receiving a radiation boost, the task force favored a dose schedule of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions when HF-WBI is planned. The task force also recommended that the heart should be excluded from the primary treatment fields (when HF-WBI is used) due to lingering uncertainty regarding late effects of HF-WBI on cardiac function. The task force could not agree on the appropriateness of a tumor bed boost in patients treated with HF-WBI. Conclusion: Data were sufficient to support the use of HF-WBI for patients with early-stage breast cancer who met all the aforementioned criteria. For other patients, the task force could not reach agreement either for or against the use of HF-WBI, which nevertheless should not be interpreted as a contraindication to its use. Copyright  Inc."
"Söderlund, K., et al.",2007,Intact Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 Complex Predicts Good Response to Radiotherapy in Early Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To investigate the expression and predictive role of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex and the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) for the outcome of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. Methods and Materials: The protein expression of ATM and the DNA repair proteins in the MRN complex were investigated using immunohistochemistry in tumors from 224 women with early breast cancer, who were randomized to receive postoperative radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Compared with normal breast tissue, the staining intensity of Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, and ATM was reduced in a majority of the tumors. Weak expression of the MRN complex was correlated with high histologic grade and estrogen receptor negativity (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Radiotherapy significantly reduced the risk of local recurrence as compared with chemotherapy (p = 0.04). The greatest benefit of radiotherapy was seen in patients with moderate/strong expression of the MRN complex (relative risk = 0.27, 95% confidence interval = 0.098-0.72, p = 0.009), whereas patients with negative/weak MRN expression had no benefit of radiotherapy compared with adjuvant chemotherapy. These results suggest that an intact MRN complex is important for the tumor cell eradicating effect of radiotherapy. Conclusions: Reduced expression of the MRN complex predicts a poor effect of radiotherapy in patients with early breast cancer.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Solin, L. J., et al.",1987,Determination of depth for electron breast boosts.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"A technique has been developed to determine the depth for the electron boost treatments for patients undergoing definitive irradiation for early stage breast cancer. A series of parallel link chains are placed on the breast over the clinically determined site of the boost. Using fluoroscopy, the physician confirms that the chains overlie the tumor bed which is outlined by radiopaque surgical clips placed at the time of the breast biopsy. A pair of orthogonal films and/or rotational stereo shift films are obtained with a standard simulator unit. Using the image of the chains to define the surface contour, the depth of each surgical clip is measured directly from the orthogonal films or calculated from the rotational stereo shift films. With this information, the physician can determine the appropriate electron energy to cover the target volume. This method was tested by comparison with depths measured from CT scan, and close agreement was demonstrated."
"Solin, L. J., et al.",1988,Definitive irradiation for early stage breast cancer: The University of Pennsylvania experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"From 1977 to 1984, 552 breast cancers in 548 women were treated with definitive irradiation following breast-conserving surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. All patients had invasive carcinoma and were AJC clinical Stage I or II. Pathologic axillary lymph node staging was known for all cases. The 5-year actuarial survival for the entire group was 93% with an NED survival of 81%. The 5-year survival for clinical Stage I and II patients was 97 and 87%, respectively, with a corresponding NED survival of 87 and 73%, respectively. For pathologic Stage I and II patients, the corresponding survival figures were 97 and 89%, respectively, with NED survival rates of 86 and 76% respectively. The overall 5-year actuarial local failure rate was 6%, and the rate of local only as the first failure was 3%. The overall local-regional failure rate was 13% with a local-regional only first failure rate of 8%. These results compare favorably with other reported series and contribute a substantial number of patients to the increasing experience with definitive irradiation following breast-conserving procedures. The relatively low incidence of breast recurrence may be related to the emphasis on integrating the surgical, pathologic, and radiotherapeutic aspects of treatments, as well as the emergence of a re-excision policy for patients at high risk to have residual tumor."
"Solin, L. J., et al.",1989,Age as a prognostic factor for patients treated with definitive irradiation for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"From 1977 to 1986, 88 breast cancers in 86 women age ≤ 35 years were treated with definitive irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. The records of these cases were reviewed and compared to 808 breast cancers in 798 women age ≥ 36 years treated similarly during the same time period. All women had AJC clinical Stages I or II invasive carcinoma of the breast and had undergone an axillary surgical staging procedure to determine pathologic lymph node staging prior to receiving definitive radiotherapy. There was no statistical difference between the younger and older women in terms of 5-year actuarial overall survival (94% vs. 90%), NED survival (78% vs. 81%) or relapse-free survival (70% vs. 77%). Although the younger women tended to have an earlier pattern of failure, the difference between the actuarial percentage of failures at 5 years for the two age groups was not significantly different for local only first failure (9% vs. 5%), regional only first failure (6% vs. 3%), and local and regional only first failure (0% vs. 1%). Subset analyses also did not show a difference between the younger and older patients. Although longer follow-up will be needed to confirm these observations, our 5-year results show that younger patients ≤ age 35 do not have an adverse outcome in terms of survival, local control, or regional control when compared with older patients ≥ age 36. Potential candidates for definitive irradiation following breast-conserving surgery should not be excluded for treatment solely on the basis of younger age ≤ 35 years."
"Solin, L. J., et al.",1991,Results of the 1983 Patterns of Care Process Survey for definitive breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"This report has documented the U.S.A. national averages for the results of the Process Survey for the 1983 Patterns of Care Study (PCS) for the processes of evaluation, work-up, and treatment for definitive breast irradiation. All women had been treated with definitive irradiation following breast-conserving surgery for early stage breast cancer. The data were collected from 191 patient charts which were randomly selected from five strata of radiotherapy practice to represent the U.S.A. national averages. Clinical and pathological characteristics of the primary tumor and regional lymph node status were similar to reported series as of 1983. Analysis of this Process Survey showed high compliance with the 1983 PCS standards of best current management of breast cancer. However, there was a wide variation in the technical delivery of the radiation fields and radiation doses used. There was good compliance with the use of documentation of the radiation treatments with simulation films, port films, implant films, and field descriptions. No systematic difference was seen amongst the various strata of radiotherapy practice. Although compliance with the majority of the parameters was relatively high, the small but important areas of lack of compliance with the standards of best current management document an incomplete transfer of technology to the radiation oncology community as a whole in 1983. Separate analysis for the outcome of treatment for these cases will be necessary to correlate process with outcome."
"Solin, L. J., et al.",1991,The significance of the pathology margins of the tumor excision on the outcome of patients treated with definitive irradiation for early stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"To evaluate the significance of the pathology margins of the tumor excision on the outcome of treatment, an analysis was performed of 697 consecutive women with clinical Stage I or II invasive carcinoma of the breast treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive irradiation. Complete gross excision of the primary tumor was performed in all cases, and an axillary staging procedure was performed to determine pathologic axillary lymph node status. The 697 patients were divided into four groups based on the final pathology margin from the primary tumor excision or from the re-excision if performed. These four groups were: (a) 257 patients with a negative margin (>2 mm), (b) 57 patients with a positive margin, (c) 37 patients with a close margin (≤2 mm), and (d) 346 patients with an unknown margin. The patients with positive final pathology margins were focally positive on microscopic examination. Patients with grossly positive margins or with diffusely positive microscopic margins were treated with conversion to mastectomy. There was a significant difference in the total radiation dose for the four groups (median dose of 6000 vs 6500 vs 6400 vs 6240 cGy, respectively; p < .0001). There was no significant difference among the four groups for 5-year actuarial overall survival (p = .19), no evidence of disease (NED) survival (p = .95), or relapse-free survival (p = .80). There was no significant difference among the four groups for five year actuarial local or regional control (all p ≥ .29). Subset analyses did not identify any poor outcome subgroups. These results have demonstrated that selected patients with focally positive or close microscopic pathology margins can be adequately treated with definitive breast irradiation. Patient selection and the technical delivery of radiation treatment including a boost may have been important contributing factors to the good outcome in these patients."
"Solin, L. J., et al.",1995,Ten-year results of the treatment of early-stage breast carcinoma in elderly women using breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The optimal management of breast cancer in elderly women is not well established. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the outcome of breast cancer in elderly women treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation. Methods and Materials: An analysis was performed of 558 women age ≥ 50 years treated with breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation for Stages I-II invasive carcinoma of the breast. Of the 558 total women, there were 173 elderly women age ≥ 65 years and a comparison group of 385 women age 50-64 years. Treatment for all women included complete gross excision of the primary tumor, pathologic axillary lymph node staging, and definitive breast irradiation. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was used in 18% (102 out of 558) of the overall group. Adjuvant tamoxifen was used in 17% (94 out of 558) of the overall group. The median follow-up after treatment was 6.2 years (mean = 6.4 years; range = 0.1-15.4 years). Results: Elderly patients age ≥ 65 years and patients age 50-64 years were both found to have tumors with adverse prognostic features, including clinical T2 lesions (43 vs. 34%, respectively; p = 0.055), estrogen receptor negativity (9 vs. 16%, respectively; p = 0.13), and progesterone receptor negativity (17 vs. 21%, respectively; p = 0.50). Pathologic axillary lymph node staging showed that 24% of the elderly women were node positive, including 8% with four or more positive nodes, which was not different from women age 50-64 years (p = 0.23). There was no difference between the two age groups for the rate of deaths from breast cancer at 10 years (13 vs. 13%, respectively; p = 0.71). However, there was a significant difference between the two age groups for the rate of deaths from intercurrent disease at 10 years (11 vs. 2%, respectively; p = 0.0006). There were no differences between the two age groups for the 10-year rates of overall survival (77 vs. 85%, respectively; p = 0.14), relapse-free survival (64 vs. 70%, respectively; p = 0.16), freedom from distant metastases (83 vs. 78%, respectively; p = 0.45), or local failure (13 vs. 12%, respectively; p = 0.60). Conclusions: These results have shown that breast carcinomas in elderly women are not indolent and have a number of adverse prognostic features. Breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation in elderly women age ≥ 65 years achieves good outcomes for survival, freedom from distant metastases, and local control, which are comparable to women age 50-64 years. The causes of deaths in elderly women age ≥ 65 years are from both breast cancer and intercurrent disease. Breast-conserving surgery and definitive breast irradiation should continue to be considered as a standard treatment option for appropriately selected elderly women with early-stage breast cancer."
"Speers, C., et al.",2016,Validation and extension of a radiation sensitivity signature in human breast cancer: Toward personalized risk stratification.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): An unmet clinical need in breast cancer (BC) management is the identification patients who will respond to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that the integration of post-RT clonogenic survival data with gene expression data across a large spectrum of BC cell lines would generate a BC-specific RT sensitivity signature predictive for RT response in BC. Materials/Methods: Clonogenic survival assays were used to measure surviving fraction after 2 Gy of RT across 21 BC cell lines. SF2 Gy was used as a continuous variable and the RT sensitivity score (RSS) was correlated to gene expression using a Spearman correlation method on an individual gene basis. Genes were selected for the signature based on correlation with a P value < 0.05 and FDR of < 0.01. This signature was trained and validated in a separate human breast tumor datasets containing early stage patients treated with surgery and RT alone (no chemotherapy) to assess the predictive effect of RS signature on recurrence risk after RT. Intrinsic subtyping, scaling, cross-platforming, and validation was done to recapitulate PAM50 and MammaPrint using derived algorithms and source datasets. Results: We previously demonstrated that clonogenic survival identifies a range of radiation sensitivity in human BCC lines with no significant correlation to the intrinsic BC subtype. Refinement of our previous signature using Spearmans correlation method narrowed the signature to 51 genes associated with radiation sensitivity. This gene signature is enriched for genes involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA damage response (enrichment P value = 5.0 E-22). Knockdown of genes associated with the radioresistance signature identifies previously unreported radiation resistance genes. Application of this RS signature to multiple independent breast cancer datasets with annotated local recurrence rates, some with median follow-up times of >13.5 years, accurately discriminates patients with increased and decreased rates of local recurrence (all datasets P value < 0.0001). Furthermore, extension of the signature now identifies intrinsic breast cancer subtype (based on PAM50) and is being incorporated into the signature. Conclusion: We previously derived a human BC-specific RT sensitivity signature with biologic relevance and extend our validation studies into datasets with longer median follow-up. The signature is not correlated to the intrinsic subtypes of human breast cancer. This signature is currently being validated in randomized, phase III clinical trials of early stage breast cancer patients treated with and without radiation treatment and is the first molecular signature of RT response to undergo validation in such randomized datasets. By identifying patients with tumors refractory to standard RT this signature has the potential for personalization of RT, particularly in patients for whom treatment intensification is needed and may further be refined to identify women for whom the omission of RT is appropriate."
"Spiegel, A., et al.",2010,Effect of radiation on partial breast reconstruction in patients undergoing mini-abdominal free flaps.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Oncologic equivalence between mastectomy and breast conservation therapy (BCT) is well established. Achievement of margin-negative tumorectomy, a requirement for optimal locoregional control, may place patients at increased risk for suboptimal cosmesis and exclude patients with unfavorable tumor location and/or breast/lumpectomy ratio. In an effort to expand BCT option for such patients, various oncoplastic techniques have been developed. Tailored mini-abdominal free flaps (MAFF) for partial breast reconstruction represents a novel technique. The aim of this study is to report our experience with MAFF in conjunction with radiotherapy in patients undergoing BCT. Materials/Methods: Twelve consecutive patients (mean age 50 y, range, 39-60 y) with early stage breast cancer who underwent MAFF partial breast reconstruction during a 17-month time period form the basis of this study. The reconstruction techniques included mini-SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) and mini-DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flaps. Whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) was administered to all patients either following (immediate reconstruction group, n = 7) or prior to flap reconstruction (delayed reconstruction group, n = 5). WBRT doses ranged from 45.0 to 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction, with or without an additional tumor bed boost. Four patients each received neoadjuvant, adjuvant or no chemotherapy. Mean tumor size was 2.4 cm (range, 0.3-6.7 cm). The tumor was located in the superior half of the breast in 9 patients (75%). Pretreatment breast size ranged from 34A to 38D. Mean follow-up was 61 months (range, 53-69 months). Results: All flaps were successful, although one required re-exploration and was salvaged in full. Volumetric reduction was noted in all flaps, although no cases of skin paddle contracture were identified. Wound healing was without complication in the reconstructed breasts. A small amount of fat necrosis (approximately 2 cm2) was noted in one patient in the immediate reconstruction group during flap revision surgery to achieve better symmetry. No local, regional or distal tumor recurrences were evident throughout the follow-up period. Eleven of 12 women (91%) graded their aesthetic result as good to excellent, while one patient graded her result as fair. This one patient was dissatisfied due to fat necrosis resulting from revision liposuction. Conclusions: In properly selected patients with high motivation towards breast conservation, tailored MAFF can safely and satisfactorily be implemented for the reconstruction of partial mastectomy defects. In our experience, adjuvant radiotherapy has no negative impact on immediate and delayed partial breast reconstruction utilizing MAFF."
"Stokes, E. L., et al.",2011,Effect of nodal irradiation and fraction size on cardiac and cerebrovascular mortality in women with breast cancer treated with local and locoregional radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine whether the adjuvant breast cancer radiation volume or fraction size (>2 Gy vs. ≤2 Gy) affected the risk of fatal cardiac or cerebrovascular (CCV) events and to determine whether the addition of regional radiotherapy (RT) increased the risk of fatal cerebrovascular events compared with breast/chest wall RT alone. Methods and Materials: Overall survival was compared for patients receiving breast/chest wall RT alone or breast/chest wall plus regional node RT (BRCW+NRT) in a population-based cohort of women with early-stage breast cancer who had undergone RT between 1990 and 1996. The effect of laterality, age, systemic therapy, radiation volume, and fraction size on the risk of fatal CCV events was analyzed using a competing risk method. Results: A total of 4,929 women underwent adjuvant RT. The median follow-up was 11.7 years. BRCW+NRT was associated with an increased risk of CCV death at 12 years (5% for BRCW+NRT vs. 3.5% for breast/chest wall RT alone; p = .004), but the fraction size was not (3.92% for a fraction size >2 Gy vs. 3.54% for a fraction size <2 Gy; p = .83). The 12-year absolute risk of death from stroke alone did not differ for either radiation volume (1.17% for BRCW+NRT vs. 0.8% for breast/chest wall RT alone; p = .22) or fraction size (p = .59). Conclusion: Regional RT was associated with a small (1.5% at 12 years), but statistically significant, increased risk of death from a CCV event. The addition of regional RT did not significantly increase the risk of death from stroke, although the number of events was small. An increased fraction size was not significantly associated with a greater risk of fatal CCV events. These data support the continued use of hypofractionated adjuvant regional RT.  Inc."
"Stokes, W. A., et al.",2017,Disparities and patterns of care in boost utilization for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The EORTC 22881 trial established the benefit of adding a tumor bed boost to adjuvant whole breast irradiation following breast conservation surgery (BCS) for invasive breast cancer, particularly among younger women and those with high-grade disease. It is unknown how these findings have impacted practice in the United States (US). We therefore undertook an analysis of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to evaluate current trends in boost utilization. Purpose/Objective(s): We queried NCDB for women diagnosed with T1-2 N0-1 M0 invasive ductal carcinoma from 2004-2014 undergoing BCS with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (MVA) was performed to identify associations between boost receipt and demographic, facility-specific, clinical, pathologic, and treatment factors. Results: We identified 423,500 women, with most (80.3%) receiving boost. On MVA, receipt of boost was independently associated with age, race, insurance, facility type, tumor grade and stage, receptor status, margin status, and fractionation (Table). Notably, both younger age and higher tumor grade were independent predictors of receiving boost, as were other adverse pathologic features. Conversely, black women, women with Medicaid, and those lacking insurance were significantly less likely to receive boost. Conclusion: While clinicopathologic factors supported by randomized evidence appear to influence the boost utilization by US providers treating early-stage breast cancer, disparities by race and insurance status are concerning and warrant additional exploration."
"Strnad, V., et al.",2016,"5-year results of accelerated partial breast irradiation using sole interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy versus whole-breast irradiation with boost after breast-conserving surgery for low-risk invasive and in-situ carcinoma of the female breast: A randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.",The Lancet,"Background In a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) for patients with stage 0, I, and IIA breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving treatment was compared with whole-breast irradiation. Here, we present 5-year follow-up results. Methods We did a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial at 16 hospitals and medical centres in seven European countries. 1184 patients with low-risk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ treated with breast-conserving surgery were centrally randomised to either whole-breast irradiation or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Analysis was done according to treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00402519. Findings Between April 20, 2004, and July 30, 2009, 551 patients had whole-breast irradiation with tumour-bed boost and 633 patients received APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy. At 5-year follow-up, nine patients treated with APBI and five patients receiving whole-breast irradiation had a local recurrence; the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 1·44% (95% CI 0·51-2·38) with APBI and 0·92% (0·12-1·73) with whole-breast irradiation (difference 0·52%, 95% CI -0·72 to 1·75; p=0·42). No grade 4 late side-effects were reported. The 5-year risk of grade 2-3 late side-effects to the skin was 3·2% with APBI versus 5·7% with whole-breast irradiation (p=0·08), and 5-year risk of grade 2-3 subcutaneous tissue late side-effects was 7·6% versus 6·3% (p=0·53). The risk of severe (grade 3) fibrosis at 5 years was 0·2% with whole-breast irradiation and 0% with APBI (p=0·46). Interpretation The difference between treatments was below the relevance margin of 3 percentage points. Therefore, adjuvant APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early breast cancer is not inferior to adjuvant whole-breast irradiation with respect to 5-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival.

We aimed to assess the effect of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) on local control for patients with stage 0, I, and IIA breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving treatment compared with patients who received WBI with boost. In part I we report mature 5-year local control and survival results of a multicenter randomized noninferiority trial comparing APBI using sole multicatheter brachytherapy to standard WBI. Materials/Methods: Patients aged ≥40 years with low-risk invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ after BCS were randomized to receive either 50 Gy WBI with tumor bed boost of 10 Gy or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, disease-free survival, cumulative incidence of regional recurrence and distant metastasis, incidence and severity of acute and late side effects, and cosmesis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00402519. Results: Between April 2004 and July 2009, 1184 patients with early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either WBI or APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy. Median follow-up of patients was 6.6 years. Baseline factors were evenly distributed across arms. Analysis was done “as treated.” Five-year local recurrence rates were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.5%e2.4%) in the APBI arm, and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.1%e1.7%) in the WBI arm (P=.42). Furthermore, second primary ipsilateral breast cancers (different histology compared with the primary tumor) occurred in 1.1% of patients in the WBI group versus 0.9% in the APBI group (P=.91), difference -0.2% (95% CI: -9.15e8.75). Five-year disease-free survival was 95.0% (95% CI: 93.3%e96.7%) in the APBI group versus 94.5% (95% CI: 92.5%e96.4%) in the WBI group (P=.8). Five-year overall survival rates were 97.3% (95% CI: 96%-98.6%) in the APBI group versus 95.6% (95% CI: 93.8%-97.3%) in the WBI group (P=.1). Conclusion: Concerning 5-year local control, disease-free survival and overall survival adjuvant APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy after BCS for early breast cancer is equally effective with adjuvant WBIwith tumor bed boost. This is the first phase 3 study proving noninferiority of APBI in comparison to WBI for selected early-stage breast cancer patients."
"Suh, W. W., et al.",2005,A cost comparison analysis of partial versus whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To assess, if and for whom, there are cost savings associated with alternate breast radiotherapy (RT) techniques when compared with the conventional external beam-based whole-breast RT with a boost (WBRT-B). Methods and Materials: Treatment planning and delivery utilization data were modeled for eight different breast RT techniques: (1) WBRT-B: 60 Gy in 30 fractions; (2) WBRT: 50 Gy in 25 fractions; (3) WBRT-accelerated (AC): 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions; (4) WBRT-intensity-modulated RT (IMRT): 60 Gy in 30 fractions; (5) accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)-IC, MammoSite: 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; (6) APBI-IT, HDR interstitial: 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; (7) APBI three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT): 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; or (8) APBI-IMRT: 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions. Costs incurred by payer (i.e., direct medical costs; 2003 Medicare Fee Schedule) and patient (i.e., direct nonmedical costs; time and travel) were estimated. Total societal costs were then calculated for each treatment approach. Results: Not all efforts to reduce overall treatment time result in total cost savings. The least expensive partial breast-based RT approaches were the external beam techniques (APBI-3D-CRT, APBI-IMRT). Any reduced cost to patients for the HDR brachytherapy-based APBI regimens were overshadowed by substantial increases in cost to payers, resulting in higher total societal costs; the cost of HDR treatment delivery was primarily responsible for the increased direct medical cost. For the whole breast-based RT approaches, treating without a boost (WBRT) or with WBRT-AC reduced total costs. Overall, WBRT-AC was the least costly of all the regimens, in terms of costs to society; APBI approaches, in general, were favored over whole-breast techniques when only considering costs to patients. Conclusions: Based on societal cost considerations, WBRT-AC appears to be the preferred approach. If one were to pursue a partial-breast RT regimen to minimize patient costs, it would be more advantageous from a societal perspective to pursue external beam-based approaches such as APBI-3D-CRT or APBI-IMRT in lieu of the brachytherapy-based regimens.

"Sun, G. Y., et al.",2017,Hypofractionated radiation therapy after mastectomy for the treatment of high-risk breast cancer: 5-year follow-up result of a randomized trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Randomized trials testing hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) after breast conservative surgery in women with early breast cancer have reported similar results compared with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT). We conducted a phase III non-inferior randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of HFRT after mastectomy. In this analysis, we report the 5-year result. Purpose/Objective(s): From 2008 to 2016, 820 high-risk patients mainly with stage III breast cancer were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned after mastectomy to receive either HFRT (43.5 Gy/15f/3w) or CFRT (50 Gy/25f/5w) to the chest wall and supraclavicular nodal region. The primary endpoint was locoregional recurrence (LRR). The recurrence and survival rates were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Acute and late toxicities were scaled with CTC3.0 criteria, and Chi-squire test was used to compare the differences. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00793962. Results: Of 811 eligible patients, there were 400 in HFRT and 411 in CFRT group. The median age was 49 years (range, 24-74). 767 (94.6%) patients had stage III and 44 (5.4%) had stage II diseases. All received chemotherapy. 139 (17.1%) patients received trastuzumab targeted therapy. Out of 644 patients with ER and/or PR positive, 603 (93.6%) received hormonal therapy. The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups (Table 1). With a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR, 39-79) for surviving patients, the 5-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 92.8%. The 5-year distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 22.7%, 74.9%, and 86%. There were no significant differences in 5-year LRR (8.4% vs. 6.0%, P = 0.396), DM (21.3% vs. 24.3%, P = 0.530), DFS (75.1% vs. 74.6%, P = 0.841), and OS (84.9% vs. 87.1%, P = 0.562) between HFRT and CFRT group. The incidences of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis, lymphedema, and shoulder disorder were similar between the two groups, but there was less grade 3 acute skin toxicity in HFRT group. Four patients developed ischemic heart disease with 1 in HFRT and 3 in CFRT group. No brachial plexopathy occurred during follow-up. Conclusion: In patients with high-risk breast cancer after mastectomy, 43.5 Gy delivered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks has comparable efficacy and toxicity at 5 years with standard fractionation. Long-term follow-up is required."
"Sura, K., et al.",2015,Socioeconomic factors impact probability of receiving radiation as part of breast conserving therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the potential impact of socioeconomic factors on the probability of patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) as part of breast conserving therapy (BCT) for low-risk early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Data were extracted from the survival, epidemiology, and end result (SEER) database from 2000-2011 to include early stage breast cancer patients who met suitable criteria according to ASTRO accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) consensus guidelines. This included female patients with a history of breast cancer who underwent a lumpectomy, were at least 60y, and had a tumor 0-20 mm in size without positive lymph nodes. Patients were to be estrogen receptor positive and have had at least one regional lymph node removed. Multiple socioeconomic/demographic factors, including insurance status, age, race, degree of education, median family or household income and marital status, were analyzed with patients either receiving or not receiving RT using T-test or ANOVA. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. Results: A total of 8620 patients fit the inclusion criteria. The median tumor size was 10 mm (2-20); a median of 2 nodes were examined. All cases were stage IA, and 100% were ER+ while 86% were PR+ and 11% were HER2+ or unknown. 52% were age 60-69y; 34.5% 70-79y and 13.5% at least 80y. 86.5% were white; 6.3% were black, 6.5% other, and 0.7% of unknown race. A majority of the data were from CA (38.4%), NJ (10.8%), and GA (10.4%). 97.4% of patients had insurance; 0.7% were uninsured; and 1.9% insurance status was unknown. Median family income was $73,230 ($27,660-125,584). 6446 (75%) received some form of RT. 87% had external beam while 13% underwent APBI. Having health insurance had no impact on probability of RT receipt (p = 0.30). Age significantly impacted treatment with no RT given to 17%, 20%, 27%, 31%, 41% and 61% of those ages 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80- 84, and >85y respectively (p < 0.001). Marital status significantly impacted RT receipt with single, never married (28% no RT) and widowed (33% no RT) patients least likely to receive it (v married, divorced or separated 21% no RT, p < 0.001). Patients with at least a high school degree were more likely to receive RT (p < 0.0001) and having a bachelor's degree increased probability of APBI (p = 0.013). The median family income was higher in those receiving RT ($73,770 v $72,830, p = 0.037). Race was associated with RT receipt where 25% of whites, 30% of blacks and 22% of those with other races had no RT (p<0.001). Race was predictive of APBI receipt with 14% of whites, 14% of blacks, and 6% of those with other races having APBI (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Multiple socioeconomic factors are associated with the probability of patients with early stage low-risk breast cancer receiving RT as part of BCT including income, age, educational level, and race. APBI was more likely given to highly educated patients."
"Surapaneni, A., et al.",2012,Effect of radiation on breast cancer specific survival for elderly women with early stage (T1N0 ER+) breast cancer: Review of the seer database.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Previous trials have investigated the benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in older women with T1N0, estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. While RT was shown to be effective in reducing local recurrence, there was no effect on overall survival (OS) or disease free survival. The role of RT in older women has therefore been questioned after the publication of these results. This study aims to analyze the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End results (SEER) database to study how often RT is used in this cohort and whether it is associated with any impact on OS or Breast-cancer specific survival (BCSS). Materials/Methods: We identified women ages 70-79 who were diagnosed with T1N0, ER positive invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma between 1998 and 2008, who underwent lumpectomy with or without adjuvant RT. Patients who survived less than one year from the time of diagnosis were excluded, to reduce potential selection bias favoring radiation. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare OS and BCSS. Univariate and Multivariate Cox Regression analysis (MVA) was used to assess the impact of adjuvant RT on OS and BCSS accounting for confounding variables. Results: A total of 16,800 patients were identified, of which 13464 (80.1%) received RT and 3363 (19.9%) did not. Five-year OS for those who received RT was 90.7% compared to 85.2% for those who did not receive RT (p < 0.001); 10 year OS was 70.4% compared to 61.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. Five-year BCSS for those who received RT was 98.5% and 97.8% for those without RT (p = 0.002); 10 year BCSS was 95.9% compared to 92.1% (p = 0.002), respectively. MVA for OS revealed that black race (HR = 1.241, 95% CI: 1.008-1.527, p = 0.042) and increasing age (HR = 1.092, 95% CI: 1.075-1.109, p < 0.001) were associated with worse OS. RT was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.694, 95% CI: 0.625-0.77, p < 0.001). MVA for BCSS revealed that increasing age was associated with worse BCSS (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.007-1.095, p = 0.021) while RT was associated with improved BCSS (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.507-0.885, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Despite previously published data that have questioned the use of adjuvant RT in older women with early stage breast cancer, these results show that over the past 10 years, the majority of elderly women (80.1%) are still being treated with adjuvant RT. While this large population based study revealed that the use of RT after lumpectomy appears to be associated with improved OS and a small improvement in BCSS, the inherent biases within the SEER database may have influenced these findings. Given that these women have an overall low recurrence rate, further large prospective studies with very large patient cohorts might be necessary to confirm these results."
"Swain, M., et al.",2017,"Predictors of pathological complete response and outcome in HER2 positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the standard of care for locally advanced breast cancer and is increasingly used for high-risk early-stage breast cancer. Pathological complete response (pCR) following NAC is associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, data on the patterns of locoregional relapse (LRR) in HER2-positive (HER2+) patients in this setting treated uniformly with modern chemotherapy regimens and HER2-targeted therapy are limited. This study aimed to elucidate predictors of pCR and outcomes in HER2+ breast cancer treated with NAC and trastuzumab, surgery and radiotherapy (RT). Purpose/Objective(s): Clinicopathologic and demographic data of clinical stage II/III HER2+ (HER2+ was defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines at the time of reporting) and hormone receptor (HR) positive, (HR+, Estrogen and/or Progesterone receptor ≥1%), or HR negative (HR-) breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab, surgery, followed by adjuvant RT between 2008 and 2015 were reviewed. Probability of overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between pCR and non-pCR groups using the log-rank test. The locoregional recurrence (LRR) rate was estimated using the cumulative incidence function by treating death as competing risk. Predictors of pCR (ypT0/Tis and ypN0) and DFS were identified using logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. Results: The median follow-up was 4 years (range 0.9-9.6), and median age was 48 years (range 28-79). The majority of the patients had clinical T2/3 (80%), N1 (52%), and HR+ disease (67%), and underwent mastectomy (73%). Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 27%. Most patients received FEC-DH chemotherapy (79%). All patients received adjuvant RT, with 50 Gy/25 fractions (134) to the breast/chest wall (1 received 42.4 Gy/16 fractions), 132 patients had nodal RT and 21 patients received a breast boost. pCR was achieved in 42 (31%) patients, and of these 57% had HR-disease. Clinical T1/2 (OR 3.3, [95%CI: 1.44-7.36], p=0.01) and HR-disease (OR 5.5, [95% CI: 2.39-12.81], p=0.001) were associated with pCR on both univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The 3-year DFS and OS were 87.1% and 98.3%, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 4.2%, with 1 LRR in the pCR group and 6 in the non-pCR group. Clinical stage, grade 3 disease and age did not impact 3-year DFS. However, pCR was associated with a trend towards improved 3-year DFS (94% vs 84%, p=0.07). Conclusion: Clinical T1/2 and HR negative disease were predictors of pCR in this HER2+ breast cancer patient cohort. Achievement of pCR was associated with a trend towards better 3-year DFS."

M.",2017,Self-reported quality of life in early-stage breast cancer: An ongoing multicenter trial of intra-operative electronic brachytherapy during breast conservation surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To describe patient-reported quality of life (QOL) in women undergoing intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT) using an electronic brachytherapy system at the time of lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): This ongoing open-label, single-arm, prospective, non-randomized trial has enrolled 1,028 participants at 28 hospitals in the USA (27) and Portugal (1). Participants with biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (N = 246) or invasive ductal carcinoma (N = 777) received lumpectomy followed by IORT with an electronic brachytherapy system. Patient-reported QOL was assessed with the functional assessment of cancer therapy-breast (FACT-B) self-reporting questionnaire at the following time points: baseline screening visit and all post-operative follow-up visits including month 1, 6, 12, 18, year 2, and 3. QOL will continue to be assessed annually through year 10 except in participants who experience breast cancer recurrence or a second primary cancer. The prespecified primary outcome of this study is 5-year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. Prespecified secondary outcomes include 10-year recurrence and QOL. Results: Mean age at enrollment was 66 years with a range of 41 to 93 years. The number of participants completing 2-and 3-year follow-up was 324 and 114, respectively. Median follow-up time was 1.2 years. To date, there have been six ipsilateral breast recurrences and three new contralateral breast cancers. For participants at both 2-and 3-year follow-up, QOL improved from baseline screening to final follow-up, as demonstrated by an increase in total FACT-B scores (116.41 to 125.20 for 2-year follow-up and 111.86 to 126.10 for 3-year follow-up). Subscale scores were also higher at final follow-up compared with baseline screening for all FACT-B subscales including physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and the breast cancer subscale (BCS). Conclusion: Single-fraction IORT using an electronic brachytherapy system is a convenient treatment option for select patients with early-stage breast cancer, requiring only one dose of radiation therapy at the time of breast conservation surgery. Early results from this trial suggest that this treatment option may be associated with improved patient-reported QOL."

Purpose/Objective(s): To date, 1,028 participants have been enrolled in this open label, single-arm, prospective, non-randomized trial at 28 hospitals in the USA (27) and Portugal (1). 1,023 participants with biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal carcinoma who met the inclusion criteria underwent lumpectomy followed by IORT to the lumpectomy cavity. A presterilized lead shield was placed on the chest wall and a balloon applicator suitable to the surgical bed was placed in the lumpectomy cavity and inflated with saline (30-75 cc). Balloon surface-to-skin distance of ≥ 1.0 cm was confirmed by ultrasound. Single-fraction IORT (20 Gy) was delivered at the balloon applicator surface with a mean radiation treatment time of 11.3 minutes. Following IORT, balloon was deflated and removed along with lead shielding, and surgical site was sutured. The prespecified primary outcome of this 10-year follow-up study is ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence at 5 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes include 10-year recurrence and cosmesis (Harvard Scale). Results: Median follow-up time was 1.2 years with 320, 102, and 10 participants completing 2-, 3-, and 4-year follow-up, respectively. Mean age at enrollment was 66 years (range 41-93). 246 participants had DCIS and 777 had invasive ductal carcinoma. DCIS nuclear grades were high (82), intermediate (119), or low (45) with three identified as bilateral. Invasive cancers were Grade 1 (318) including two bilateral cases, Grade 2 (340) with one bilateral case, Grade 3 (105) with two bilateral cases, or no Grade (14). Mean tumor size was 12.01 ± 10.8 mm. Cosmesis was excellent in 100% of participants at 4-year follow-up and excellent to good in 94% and 91% of participants at 2-and 3-year follow-up, respectively. The number of reported adverse events (AEs) that were Grade 2 or higher was 169 (9%). Seroma, breast induration, erythema, breast fibrosis, and breast pain were the most frequent AEs. There were ten deaths, none of which were breast cancer related. There were six ipsilateral breast recurrences and three new contralateral breast cancers. Conclusion: Single-fraction IORT using an electronic brachytherapy system following breast conservation surgery may be a promising treatment option for select early-stage breast cancer patients. Early findings from this multicenter trial suggest that the short and convenient course of radiation therapy has low morbidity, excellent to good cosmetic results, and a low rate of high-grade adverse events and recurrences."
"Syed, N., et al.",2015,Feasibility and early outcomes of a multicenter trial of intraoperative radiation therapy using electronic brachytherapy at the time of breast conservation surgery for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To describe the initial experience of a multi-center, non-randomized study of patients treated with a single fraction of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) immediately following surgical resection of early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Between May 2012 and May 2013, 78 patients were enrolled by 12 US hospitals. Upon meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients underwent partial mastectomy. While in the operating room, a balloon applicator suitable to the surgical bed was placed in the lumpectomy cavity and inflated with saline (30-75 cc). The skin was temporarily closed over the balloon and ultrasound examination performed to confirm that the balloon surface-to-skin distance was > 1.0 cm. A single fraction of intra-operative radiation therapy was delivered to the lumpectomy cavity. The prescribed dose was 20 Gy at the balloon applicator surface, and the mean treatment time was 10.5 minutes. Results: 77 patients received the prescribed dose of 20 Gy; 1 subject received 21 Gy. 11 patients were removed from the primary analysis post- IORT due to positive surgical margins (3), positive sentinel lymph nodes (2), balloon surface-to-skin distance < 1 cm (1), tumor size > 3 cm (3), and invasive lobular carcinoma (2). These 11 subjects will continue to be followed for the duration of this 10-year study. 53 of the 67 evaluable patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median 412 days). The mean patient age was 65 years (43-89). 10 patients (15%) had ductal carcinoma in situ, 55 (82%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, and 2 (3%) had unknown histology. The DCIS nuclear grade was evenly distributed between high (5) and low/intermediate (5). Invasive cancer was Grade 1-2 in 45/55 cases. 64 patients (95.5%) had T1 lesions, 2 (3%) had T2 lesions, and 1 (1.5%) was unknown. The mean tumor size was 11.0 mm ± 5.7 mm. At 12 months, only 17/100 adverse events were Grade 2 or higher, and only 4/100 were serious (death due to aortic injury, malignant neoplasm [ovarian cancer], nausea, and death of unknown cause. The most frequent side effects were erythema (17.1%), ecchymosis (15.7%), and seroma (12.8%). Cosmesis was excellent-to-good in 94% of cases. Conclusion: IORT as part of the conservative treatment of breast cancer is safe, with low morbidity. Early results from this multi-center trial demonstrate this short, convenient course of radiation therapy for select patients with early stage breast cancer has excellent-to-good cosmetic results and a low rate of low-grade adverse events."

"Szumacher, E., et al.",2015,"Breast cancer patients' preferences for adjuvant radiation therapy post lumpectomy, whole-breast irradiation versus partial-breast irradiation: A single-institutional study.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Whole breast irradiation (WBI) is the standard regimen of radiation therapy following lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer. Recently, interest in partial breast irradiation (PBI) as an alternative to WBI has increased. However, the preference of patients as to what type of radiation therapy regimen they would prefer and why is unclear in the literature. This study was conducted to determine whether patients with early stage breast cancer prefer PBI or WBI and to identify important factors for patients when making this decision. Materials/Methods: Based on our previous study of early stage breast cancer patient information needs, the relevant literature and the ASTRO consensus statement guidelines, an educational tool and questionnaire were developed. New patients with early stage breast cancer referred for adjuvant radiation therapy at a large academic cancer center were invited to participate. Women over age 40 with a new diagnosis of breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery showing clear margins and negative axillary nodes were eligible. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Responses to survey questions were compared between patients who preferred WBI versus PBI using Chi-square analyses or Fisher's exact tests. Results: One hundred twenty-six patients were approached and 90 completed the survey. Twenty-seven (30%) preferred PBI and 55 (61%) preferred WBI. Eight patients (9%) either required more information or had no preference. Of the patients who chose WBI, 32 (58%) preferred hypofractionated radiation therapy while 14 (26%) preferred conventional radiation therapy and nine (16%) had no preference. Patients rated several factors as important, including convenience [PBI = 18/26 (69%), WBI = 36/54 (67%)], radiation dose [PBI = 20/26 (80%), WBI = 46/55 (83%)], invasiveness [PBI = 18/26 (69%), WBI = 43/53 (81%)], recurrence rate [PBI = 26/26 (100%), WBI = 55/55 (100%)], survival [PBI = 26/26 (100%), WBI = 54/55 (98%)], side effects [PBI = 21/26 (81%), WBI = 47/55 (85%)] effectiveness [PBI = 25/26 (96%), WBI = 54/54 (100%)] and radiation dose to surrounding organs [PBI = 23/26 (88%), WBI = 52/54 (95%)]. The only factor that was significantly different between the groups was standard method of treatment [PBI = 16/26 (61%), WBI = 52/54 (96%), chi-square = 16.63, p = 0.001]. Conclusion: Our study shows that patients with early breast cancer prefer WBI as an adjuvant treatment post lumpectomy. There is significant association between treatment preference and the rating of standard treatment as important. Patients preferring WBI were more likely to consider standard treatment as important compared to those preferring PBI. A detailed analysis of all decisional preferences between WBI and PBI will be presented at the meeting."
"Taghian, A. G., et al.",2006,Initial dosimetric experience using simple three-dimensional conformal external-beam accelerated partial-breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Several accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) techniques are being investigated in patients with early-stage breast cancer. We present our initial experience using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). Methods and Materials: Sixty-one patients with tumors of 2 cm or less and negative axillary nodes were treated with 3D-CRT accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) between August 2003 and March 2005. The prescribed radiation dose was 32 Gy in 4-Gy fractions given twice daily. Efforts were made to minimize the number of beams required to achieve adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage. Results: A combination of photons and electrons was used in 85% of patients. A three-field technique that consisted of opposed, conformal tangential photons and enface electrons was employed in 43 patients (70%). Nine patients (15%) were treated with a four-field arrangement, which consisted of three photon fields and enface electrons. Mean PTV volumes that received 100%, 95%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were 93% ± 7%, 97% ± 4%, and 98% ± 2%, respectively. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 7 patients (11%). Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung and heart were 1.8 Gy and 0.8 Gy, respectively. Conclusions: Simple 3D-CRT techniques of APBI can achieve appropriate PTV coverage while offering significant normal-tissue sparing. Therefore, this noninvasive approach may increase the availability of APBI to patients with early-stage breast cancer.  Inc."
"Takeda, A., et al.",2004,Evaluation of novel modified tangential irradiation technique for breast cancer patients using dose-volume histograms.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose We have previously reported that entire axillary lymph node regions could be irradiated by the modified tangential irradiation technique (MTIT). In this study, MTIT was compared with a conventional irradiation technique (CTIT) using dose-volume histograms to verify how adequately MTIT covers the breast and axillary lymph node region and the extent to which it involves the lung and heart. Methods and materials Forty-four patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated by lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy. Twenty-two patients were treated with MTIT and 22 with CTIT. In 25 patients, the breast tumor was on the left and in 19 on the right. During axillary dissection, surgical clips were left as markers at the border of the axillary lymph node region. MTIT was planned by setting the dorsal edge of the radiation field on a lateral-view simulator film at the dorsal edge of the humeral head and the cranial edge of the radiation field at the caudal edge of the humeral head. CTIT was planned to ensure radiation of the breast tissue without considering the axillary region. In this study, all patients underwent computed tomography, and the CT data were transmitted on-line to a radiotherapy planning system, in which the dose-distribution computed tomography images and dose-volume histograms were calculated by defining the breast, axillary region (levels I, II, and III), lung, and heart region. Results Dose-volume histogram analysis demonstrated that breast tissue was radiated with an 86.5-100% volume (median 96.5%) by MTIT and an 83-100% volume (median, 95%) by CTIT at >95% of the isocenter dose. The axillary lymph node regions at Levels I, II, and III were irradiated with 84-100% (median, 94.5%), 59-100% (median, 89%), and 70-100% (median, 89.5%) volumes, respectively, by MTIT and with 2-84% (median, 38%), 0-53% (median, 15%), and 0-31% (median, 0%) volumes, respectively, by CTIT at >70% of the isocenter dose. The ipsilateral lung was irradiated with a 5-22% volume (median, 11.5%) by MTIT and 5-15% volume (median 9%) by CTIT at >90% of the isocenter dose. In all 25 left-sided breast cancer patients, the volumes irradiated with an 80% isocenter dose were <30 cm3. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrated that the breast tissue was sufficiently irradiated with both CTIT and MTIT planning, the axillary lymph node areas irradiated by MTIT were much wider than those irradiated by CTIT at all levels, and the lung and heart volumes irradiated by MTIT were small.

"Takigawa, N., et al.",2000,Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia syndrome in breast- conserving therapy for early breast cancer: Radiation-induced lung toxicity.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Breast-conserving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy have played important roles in the treatment of early breast cancer. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) syndrome has recently been reported to be one of the complications of adjuvant radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for BOOP syndrome in breast cancer patients. Methods and Materials: Between January 1996 and December 1998, 157 patients with breast cancer underwent radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. The criteria used for the diagnosis of BOOP syndrome were as follows: 1) radiation therapy to the breast within 12 months, 2) general and/or respiratory symptoms lasting for at least 2 weeks, 3) radiographic lung infiltrates outside the radiation port, and 4) no evidence of a specific cause. Results: BOOP syndrome developed in 4 (2.5%) patients, who had fever and nonproductive cough, with patchy infiltrative shadows on chest roentgenograms which emerged between 5 and 6 months after radiotherapy. The symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates were rapidly improved by treatment with prednisone (40 mg/day), which was tapered over 2- to 5-month periods. However, BOOP syndrome relapsed in all cases during the tapering period or after withdrawal of prednisone. The eosinophil and neutrophil counts were increased and the ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ lymphocytes were elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in all four cases. There were no differences in proportions of patients by age, irradiated breast site, use of tamoxifen and/or chemotherapy, or radiation dose between those with and without BOOP syndrome. Conclusions: BOOP syndrome is considered an intractable form of lung toxicity after radiotherapy to the breast. An immunologic reaction mediated by eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes may be responsible for the development of this syndrome. Methods of prevention of BOOP syndrome should be established.

"Tan, W., et al.",2011,"Dosimetric comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans, with or without anterior myocardial territory and left ventricle as organs at risk, in early-stage left-sided breast cancer patients.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We evaluated heart sparing using an intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plan with the left ventricle (LV) and/or the anterior myocardial territory (AMT) as additional organs at risk (OARs). Methods and Materials: A total of 10 patients with left-sided breast cancer were selected for dosimetric planning. Both lungs, the right breast, heart, LV, and AMT were defined as OARs. We generated one tangential field plan and four IMRT plans for each patient. We examined the dose-volume histogram parameters of the planning target volume and OARs. Results: Compared with the tangential field plan, the mean dose to the heart in the IMRT plans did not show significant differences; however, the dose to the AMT and LV decreased by 18.7-45.4% and 10.8-37.4%, respectively. The maximal dose to the heart decreased by 18.6-35.3%, to the AMT by 22.0-45.1%, and to the LV by 23.5-45.0%, And the relative volumes of the heart (V≥12), AMT (V>11) and LV (V>10) decreased significantly with different levels, respectively. The volume of the heart, AMT, LV, both lungs, and right breast receiving ≥5 Gy showed a significant increase. Compared with the IMRT (H) plan, the mean dose to the heart, AMT, and LV decreased by 17.5-21.5%, 25.2-29.8%, and 22.8-29.8% and the maximal dose by 13.6-20.6%, 23.1-29.6%, and 17.3-29.1%, respectively. The IMRT plans for both lungs and the right breast showed no significant differences. Conclusions: The IMRT plans with the addition of the AMT and/or LV as OARs considerably increased heart sparing. We recommend including the LV as an additional OAR in such plans.  Inc."
"Tao, M., et al.",2014,Long-term results of breast conservation therapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer: A large community-based experience and national norms.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We reviewed our large, urban community hospital experience treating early stage breast cancer patients to determine rates of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) compared to national rates, overall survival, and risk factors for survival. Materials/Methods: A hospital tumor registry was used to identify T1-2, N0 breast cancer cases diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2007. Rates of BCT and adjuvant radiation therapy were examined, stratified by age, and compared to those of the same age, stage, and treatment period as identified through SEER. For survival analyses, cases were limited to only those patients who had definitive BCT and had at least 8 years of actual or potential follow-up. Median follow-up was 10.6 years. Cox proportional hazards models were done to assess the influence of age at diagnosis, tumor grade, biomarker status (ER, PR and HER 2 neu amplification),margin status, receipt of hormones, radiation, or chemotherapy on overall survival. Results: The overall rate of BCT for T1-2 N0 patients diagnosed from1997 to 2007 in our sample was 89.5%, and the rate of radiation after breast conserving surgery was 91.7% compared to rates of 64.2% and 74.8% in the SEER dataset. The rates of adjuvant radiation fell for those ≥ 70 years old; however, local rates remained substantially higher than in SEER, 87.5% vs 65.6%. For the subset of 1065 T1-2 N0 patients treated with BCTwho had at least 8 yrs of follow-up, median agewas 59 years old, 14.5% had triple negative status, 1.7% had positive final margins (defined as tumor on ink), 49.2% got hormones, 26.7% got chemotherapy. Median whole breast dose was 5040 cGy, 895 (81.2%) received a supplemental dose to the lumpectomy cavity (median dose, 1400 cGy). Receipt of radiation and agewere the only significant factors in the multivariate survival analysis.Given the potentially confounding impact of age on both the likelihood of receiving radiation and vital status, patients were stratified into age groups and receipt of RT or not. Conclusions: Community settings can achieve very high, appropriate rates of BCT and adjuvant radiation in early stage breast cancer patients, resulting in excellent survival rates and comparing favorably to large academic centers. Receipt of radiation is seemingly associated with improved survival, particularly in older patients, although confounders such as co-morbidities are unknown."
"Taunk, N., et al.",2011,"DEAD box 1 (DDX1) expression predicts for local control and overall survival in early-stage, node-negative breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): DEAD box 1 (DDX1) is a RNAhelicase involved in translation initiation, RNAsplicing and modification, and DNA double-strand break repair. DDX1 is a novel molecular marker in breast cancer prognosis, but has established prognostic value in other sites. Amplification of DDX1 has already been implicated in tumors including neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, retinoblastoma, and testicular carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of DDX1 expression in a cohort of patients with node-negative early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Two hundred eighty-two women treated between 1975 and 2003 with node-negative, Stage I and II breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy were included in this analysis. Treatment-naïve, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were constructed into tissue microarrays and stained for DDX1. DDX1 expression was scored from 0-3+ according to cytoplasmic intensity, with 2+ (moderate) and 3+ (strong) intensity considered positive. The molecular profiles were correlated with clinical-pathologic factors, and local, distant metastatic-free, and overall survival. Results: DDX1 positivity was identified in 142 (50%) of cases. There was a median follow-up time of 7.3 years. Median age at diagnosis was 53 years of age. 80% of the patients had T1 disease. Eleven percent were HER2neu positive, and 18% had triple negative disease. DDX1 negativity was strongly associated with triple negative phenotype (p = 0.01). DDX1 positivity was not significantly correlated with age greater than 50, race, smoking status, T-Stage, surgical margin status, or estrogen receptor status. In univariate analysis, DDX1 positivity was associated with improved local (p = 0.03), distant metastatic-free (p = 0.04), and overall survival (p = 0.05). In log-rank analysis, DDX1 positivity was found to be associated with improved local relapse-free survival (96% vs. 85%, p = 0.0233), distant metastatic free survival (95% vs. 85%, p = 0.0320), and overall survival (92% vs. 84%, p = 0.0474) at 10 years. Conclusions: Node-negative, early stage breast cancer patients with high levels of DDX1 were found to have a significant improvement in local control, distant metastatic free survival, and overall survival compared to patients with low levels of DDX1. DDX1-negativity is strongly associated with triple-negative phenotype. This data suggests that DDX1 negative patients may require novel targeted therapy or benefit from more intense chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of DDX1 expression in breast cancer tissue and the only study in a cohort treated with radiation therapy and breast conserving surgery."
"Taunk, N. K. and R. G. Prosnitz",2012,Planning comparison of intensity modulated radiation therapy delivered with 2 tangential fields versus 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for cardiac sparing in women with left-sided breast cancer.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Purpose: In women with unfavorable thoracic anatomy undergoing left breast radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery, a significant volume of the heart may receive high-dose radiation, which has been shown previously to be associated with increased late cardiac morbidity and mortality. Use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been proposed to reduce cardiac dose in these patients. We compared cardiac exposure from IMRT delivered from 2 opposed fields and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) plans employing simple heart blocks. Methods and Materials: Fourteen patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT were identified to have unfavorable cardiac anatomy, defined as maximum heart depth (MHD) ≥1.0 cm within the unblocked opposed tangential fields. 3DCRT plans utilized dynamic wedges, segments, and custom heart blocks designed by the treating physician. Tangent IMRT plans were optimized to reduce cardiac dose while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage equal to that achieved with the 3DCRT plan. We generated tangential field plans with complete heart block (CHB) or no heart block (NHB) for comparison. Plans were normalized to deliver 46 Gy to the PTV. Dose to the heart, PTV, and lumpectomy cavity were compared. Results: Mean MHD was 1.44 cm (1.0-1.86 cm). There was no significant difference in PTV receiving >95% of the prescription dose between 3DCRT and IMRT, as intended. Mean V30 to the heart was 0% for CHB plans, 1.7% for 3DCRT plans, 1.8% for IMRT plans, and 3.3% for NHB plans, respectively. There was no significant difference in heart V30 for 3DCRT and IMRT plans (P = .8). IMRT plans delivered 256 total monitor units compared with 201 in 3DCRT plans (P < .01). Conclusions: Inverse-planned tangent IMRT does not reduce high-dose radiation to the heart compared with 3DCRT, incorporating a simple heart block in women with left-sided cancer and unfavorable cardiac anatomy when PTV coverage was equalized for both plans. In select patients with early-stage breast cancer and unfavorable thoracic anatomy, 3DCRT with heart block may be sufficient to adequately protect the heart from high-dose radiation.

"Teckie, S., et al.",2017,Creation of an episode-based payment model for prostate and breast cancer radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Coding for radiation oncology (RO) is highly granular, highly variable, and incentivizes more services. As a result, payers have instituted RO benefit managers to control cost by rationing services and technologies, thereby limiting patient access to state of the art treatment. In our multicenter radiation oncology department, we aimed to create an alternative payment model (APM) for RO services that would eliminate incentive-based treatment approaches, simplify coding, enhance access to advanced technologies, reduce administrative burden, and preserve revenue. Purpose/Objective(s): We selected two high-volume ambulatory diseases, early-stage breast cancer (BrCa) and organ-confined prostate cancer (PrCa), for which to create an APM. We decided to use an episode-based payment model limiting the APM to RO services only. An episode encompasses all RO technical and professional services from the time of simulation to 90 days after completion of RT. We conducted cost analyses for all RO PrCa and BrCa episodes in 2014. Patients in our department are treated per a clinical practice guideline (CPG); we have 7 BrCa and 5 PrCa CPGs. Charges and reimbursements for each CPG were calculated using payer claims data and patient volume. Episode-based value was calculated from the average of the total charges for each CPG and relative volume of each CPG. A final episode payer-specific value was created for BrCa, and another for all PrCa. Results: We identified 158 BrCa and 148 PrCa patients treated with curative intent in 2014. >90% of patients were treated according to a CPG. Using our calculations, we established separate episode-payment ranges by payer for BrCa and PrCa. We validated the per-episode charges with regional payment data collected by Millman, a national consultancy. Their data compared favorably with our figures. These ranges are now used to set negotiation strategies with payers. Additionally, we incorporated outcomes-related quality measures to assure that care remains current and to avoid under-treatment. Conclusion: Using specific CPG coding and utilization data, we created payer-specific episode-based payments for BrCa and PrCa radiation therapy. This unique payment model simplifies the current reimbursement system and can be used for negotiation with payers of RO services. Further, this APM stays true to real-time patterns of care offered in our department. It potentially allows us to use the latest techniques and technologies without authorization management. From the payer's perspective, our APM simplifies coding, assures high quality care and enhances patient access to the latest treatment techniques. Nevertheless, given the burden of mandated bundled payment programs in orthopedics and cardiology, payers are distracted in moving forward with an RO APM strategy. Future oncology value-based payment programs may find this APM methodology desirable for both provider and payers alike."
"Thompson, R. F., et al.",2010,Hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy: Does size matter?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Concerns of suboptimal dose distribution and toxicity in large-breasted patients have led to their exclusion in hypofractionation (HfRT) trials. However, with the use of IMRT, HfRT in large-breasted patients may be both appropriate and advantageous. In this IRB-approved study, we looked at the relationship of dose distribution and toxicity in this patient population. Materials/Methods: We reviewed 94 patients treated at our institution between 2005 and 2009 with chest wall separation >25 cm or PTV >1500 cc and who received radiation of 42.4 Gy in 16 fractions using IMRT, with a boost of 9.6 Gy in 4 fractions. 74 patients were treated prone and 20 supine. All patients had early stage invasive breast cancer or DCIS treated with lumpectomy. DVH data were collected from Varian's ARIA 8.6 treatment planning software. Patient charts were reviewed for acute and late toxicity measured using RTOG radiation morbidity scale. Data were analyzed using R (v. 2.9) by Pearson correlation, Fisher's exact test, and t test, as appropriate. Results: Median chest wall separation was 24.33 cm (SD 2.87 cm), and the median PTV was 1974 cc (SD 622.6 cc). DVH analysis showed the mean PTV V95 was 90.3% and mean V105 was 3.73% with no dose >107%. The mean D05 for heart was 4.3Gy and mean V10Gy was 1.42%. The mean D05 for total lung and ipsilateral lung was 6.06Gy and 10.31Gy respectively, while the V20 Gy was 1.44% and 2.95% respectively. 64% and 24% of patients experienced acute RTOG grade 1 and 2 skin toxicity, respectively. At a median follow-up of 6 months, the RTOG late skin toxicity grade was 0 in 21.3% and 1 in 35.1% of patients. There were no local recurrences. Acute toxicity correlated weakly with body mass index (BMI) (R = 0.34, p = 0.002), with late skin toxicity also demonstrating a direct correlation (R = 0.41, p = 0.002). An inverse relationship was observed between BMI and heart dose (V10 Gy; R = -0.3, p = 0.006). Comparison of prone and supine showed no significant differences in acute toxicity, however, there was significantly more late grade 1 skin toxicity in prone (40.5%) compared to supine (15%) (p = 0.006). Chest wall separation distance was higher in the supine cohort by a mean of 3.5 cm, with a consequent 10-fold increase in lung V20 Gy (p = 6.6 x 10-7). Conclusions: Adequate PTV coverage with acceptable hot spots and excellent sparing of organs at risk was achieved using IMRT in a population of large-breasted patients. Acute and late toxicities were comparable to those reported in the literature. Interestingly, prone positioning resulted in better lung sparing as compared to supine positioning, whereas supine positioning minimized the relative prevalence of late grade 1 skin toxicity. Taken together, these data suggest that HfRT IMRT in either the prone or supine positions is a viable and appropriate therapeutic modality for large-breasted patients."
"Thukral, A. D., et al.",2010,Incidence and patterns of distant metastases in early-stage breast cancer patients after breast-conservation treatment (bct) with Radiation: The University of Pennsylvania Experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Despite multimodality treatment, a significant proportion of patients with early-stage invasive breast carcinoma develop distant metastases. However, the incidence and patterns of metastatic failure by specific anatomic site have not been described well in the literature. Materials/Methods: A total of 1,902 patients treated with BCT for early-stage invasive breast carcinoma from 1977 to 2003 were analyzed. Data on distant metastases were available for 1,861 patients (98%). Pathologic staging showed 60.2% T1N0, 14.0% T2N0, 16.9% T1N1, and 8.9% T2N1 tumors. All patients underwent lumpectomy, axillary lymph node staging, and definitive irradiation. 36% received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 36% received adjuvant hormones. Median age was 54 years (range, 21-89). Median follow-up was 7.6 years (range, 0.1-27.1 years). Results: The 15-year overall survival probability was 64% (95% CI: 60% to 67%), and the 15-year probability of freedomfromdistant metastases was 84% (95% CI: 82%-87%). The 4 most common anatomic sites of distant metastases seen were bone (n = 137), lung (n = 96), liver (n = 63) and brain (n = 61). The probabilities of any bone metastases by 5, 10, and 15 years were 5.7%, 9.2%, and 10.1%, respectively, and of isolated first bone metastases as the first site of distant failure were 3.5%, 5.7%, and 6.4%, respectively. The probabilities of any lung metastases by 5, 10, and 15 years were 4.4%, 5.9%, and 7.3%, respectively, and of isolated first lung metastases were 2.2%, 3%, and 3.5% , respectively. The probabilities of any liver metastases by 5, 10, and 15 years were 2.1%, 4.1%, and 5.9, respectively, and of isolated first liver metastases were 0.5%, 0.8%, and 1.3, respectively. The probabilities of any brain metastases were 2.3%, 4.0%, and 5.4%, respectively, and of isolated first brain metastases were 0.7%, 1%, and 1.7%, respectively. Conclusions: These results document the incidence and patterns of distant metastases, and confirm that BCT has favorable results for women with early-stage invasive breast carcinoma through 15 years after treatment. Distant metastases occur through at least 15 years after BCT, indicating that long-term surveillance of these patients remains critical. These results may help to identify patients who are at highest risk for metastases at certain anatomic sites and, therefore, who will benefit most from the emerging selection of targeted site-specific screening and treatment options."
"Tian, S., et al.",2016,Comparison of mammographic changes across three different fractionation schedules for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose As the use of hypofractionated breast radiation therapy (RT) increases, so will the need for long-term data on post-RT mammographic changes. The purpose of the present study was to longitudinally compare the incidence of common mammographic sequelae seen after breast conserving surgery and RT in patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HWBI), and conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI). Methods and Materials Patients treated with either APBI or HWBI after breast conserving therapy and with ≥3 mammograms of the treated breast were identified. They were matched 1:1 by age ±5 years to patients treated with WBI. The mammograms were evaluated for common post-RT breast findings by a mammographer who was unaware of the treatment. The outcomes were analyzed using a cumulative logistic regression model; P<.05 indicated statistically significance. Results Of 89 patients treated with RT from 2006 to 2011, 29 had received APBI, 30 had received HWBI, and 30 had received WBI. Their median age was 60 years (range 33-83). A total of 605 mammograms were evaluated, with a median follow-up of 48 months. The treatment technique did not affect the severity of architectural distortion when the groups were evaluated longitudinally. The likelihood of finding skin thickening decreased with increasing follow-up duration (odds ratio 0.6; P<.001) adjusted for fractionation schemes. No differences were seen with respect to changes in skin thickening, fluid collections, or calcifications among the treatment groups, after adjustment for the follow-up time. The clinical characteristics, including age, race, T stage, and chemotherapy use, were not linked to the likelihood of finding several mammographic phenomena over time. Conclusions Although specific post-treatment imaging findings evolved over time, RT fractionation did not alter the relative incidence or severity of architectural distortion, skin thickening, fluid collections, or calcifications. These findings will be useful to both radiologists and radiation oncologists when counseling patients regarding follow-up studies after RT."
"Tonlaar, N. Y., et al.",2014,Outcomes of African American women undergoing APBI for early-stage breast cancer: A matched pair analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): There are little data evaluating outcomes with the use of APBI for breast conservation therapy in African American women. This matched pair analysis compares the long-term outcomes of African American versus white women who underwent APBI at our institution. Materials/Methods: One hundred fifty-six patients with DCIS (33%) or stage I/II invasive breast cancer (77%) who underwent APBI at our institution between 1993 and 2013 were included in this matched pair analysis. 39 African American and 117 white patients underwent a 1:3 match according to age (+/- 5 years), T-stage (Tis vs T1 vs T2), and estrogen receptor (ER) status (+/-). Clinical outcomes were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median follow-up was 76 months. All patients received 34 Gy (brachytherapy) or 38.5 Gy (3D-CRT) in 10 B.I.D fractions. No significant differences were seen in tumor size, age at diagnosis, T-stage, N-stage, grade, margin status, ER/PR/HER 2 status, treatment type (interstitial, balloon-based, or 3D-CRT), adjuvant chemotherapy, or use of adjuvant hormone therapy by race (all P > 0.05). Local recurrence was higher for African American compared to white, with 5-year rate of 7.9% vs 1.1% (p = 0.03). Regional recurrence was also higher in African American, with 5-year rate of 5.8% vs 0% (p = 0.02). The 5-year contralateral breast failure and distant metastasis rates were 0% vs 0% (p = 0.6) and 2.7% vs 2.0% (p = 0.99), respectively. At 5 years, there were no statistically significant differences in OS (93% vs 88%, p = 0.27), CSS (96% vs 99%, p = 0.20), or DFS (92% vs 97%, p = 0.16) between the African American and white patients, respectively. On univariate analysis, age (p = 0.034) and tumor size (p = 0.025) were predictive for IBTR while nodal status (p = 0.049) and grade (p = 0.027) were predictive for regional recurrence in African American patients. No factors were predictive for white patients. On multivariate analysis, tumor size (p=0.045) and age (p = 0.024) remained independent predictors of IBTR for African American patients. Conclusions: Our results show similar overall, cause-specific, and diseasefree survival for African American patients undergoing APBI for breast conservation compared to matched White counterparts. In this small matched cohort, there was increased risk of locoregional recurrence in the African American patients and further study is needed to explore the biological, molecular, socioeconomic, and treatment related factors accounting for this difference.

"Touboul, E., et al.",1999,Local recurrences and distant metastases after breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy for early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To identify predicting factors for local failure and increased risk of distant metastases by statistical analysts of the data after breast- conserving treatment for early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: Between January 1976 and December 1993, 528 patients with nonmetastatic T1 (tumors ≤ 1 cm [n = 197], > 1 cm [n = 220]) or T2 (tumors ≤ 3 cm [n = 111]) carcinoma of the breast underwent wide excision (n = 435) or quadrantectomy (n = 93) with axillary dissection (negative nodal status [n-]: 396; 1-3 involved nodes: 100; >3 involved nodes: 32). Radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy to the entire breast via tangential fields. Patients with positive axillary lymph nodes received 45 Gy to the axillary and supraclavicular area. Patients with positive axillary nodes and/or inner or central tumor locations received 50 Gy to the internal mammary lymph node area. A boost dose was delivered to the primary site by iridium 192 implant in 298 patients (mean total dose: 15.2 ± 0.07 Gy, range: 15-25 Gy) or by electrons in 225 patients (mean total dose: 14.8 ± 0.09 Gy, range: 5-20 Gy). The mean age was 52.5 ± 0.5 years (range: 26-86 years) and 267 patients were postmenopausal. Histologic types were as follows: 463 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, 39 infiltrating lobular carcinomas, and 26 other histotypes. Grade distribution according to the Scarff, Bloom, and Richardson (SBR) classification was as follows: 149 grade 1,271 grade 2, 73 grade 3, and 35 nonclassified. The mean tumor size was 1.6 ± 0.3 cm (range: 0.3-3 cm). The intraductal component of the primary tumor was extensive (EIC = IC ≥ 25%) in 39 patients. Tumors were microscopically bifocal in 33 cases. Margins were assessed in the majority of cases by inking of the resection margins and were classified as positive in 13 cases, close (≤2 mm) in 21, negative (>2 mm tumor-free margin) in 417, and indeterminate in 77. Peritumoral vascular invasion was observed in 40 patients. Tamoxifen was administered for at least 2 years in 176 patients. At least six cycles of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy were administered in 116 patients. The mean follow-up period from the beginning of the treatment was 84.5 ± 1.7 months. Results: First events included 44 isolated local recurrences, 8 isolated axillary node recurrences, 44 isolated distant metastases, 1 local recurrence with synchronous axillary node recurrence, 7 local recurrences with synchronous metastases, and 2 local recurrences with synchronous axillary node recurrences and distant metastases. Of 39 pathologically evaluable local recurrences, 33 were classified as true local recurrences and 6 as ipsilateral new primary carcinomas. Seventy patients died (47 of breast carcinoma, 4 of other neoplastic diseases, 10 of other diseases and 9 of unknown causes). The 5- and 10-year rates were, respectively: specific survival 93% and 86%, disease-free survival 85% and 75%, distant metastasis 8.5% and 14%, and local recurrence 7% and 14%. Mean intervals from the beginning of treatment for local recurrence or distant metastases were, respectively, 60 ± 6 months (median: 47 months, range: 6-217 months) and 49.5 ± 5.4 months (median: 33 months, range: 6-217 months). After local recurrence, salvage mastectomy was performed in 46 patients (85%) and systemic hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy was administered to 43 patients. The 5-year specific survival rate after treatment for local recurrence was 78 ± 8.2%. Multivariate analysis (multivariate generalization of the proportional hazards model) showed that the probability of local control was decreased by the following four independent factors: young age (≤40 yr vs. >40 yr; relative risk [RR]: 3.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-5.8, p = 0.0002), premenopausal status (pre vs. post; RR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4-6, p = 0.0048), bifocality (univs. bifocal; RR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.6-2.8, p = 0.018), and extensive intraductal component (IC <25% vs. IC ≥ 25%; RR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-5.2, p = 0.0075). However, the probability of distant metastatic spread was increased by three different indep ndent factors: the number of involved axillary nodes (RR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.8, p = 0.0039), high histologic grade (1 vs. 2 vs. 3; RR: 2, 95% CI: 1.4-3.2, p = 0.00074), isolated local recurrence (no vs. yes; RR: 9.9, 95% CI: 5.5-18, p = 1.8 10-14). Peritumoral vascular invasion significantly influenced the probability of distant metastases in univariate analysis (p = 0.0036) but was not an independent factor: in multivariate analysis. Five-year specific survival after local recurrence was influenced only by disease-free interval from the beginning of treatment to local recurrence (≤2 years vs. >2 years; RR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.2-19, p = 0.026). Conclusions: In this series, the risk of distant metastases increased with increased incidence of isolated local recurrences. However, the predicting factors for local recurrence and distant metastases seemed to differ. In addition, after local recurrence, the disease-free interval from the beginning of treatment to local recurrence influenced specific survival."
"Trombetta, M., et al.",2010,Reduction in radiation-induced morbidity by use of an intercurrent boost in the management of early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Electron or photon boost immediately following whole-breast irradiation performed after conservation surgery for early-stage breast cancer is the accepted standard of care. This regimen frequently results in Grade III dermatitis, causing discomfort or treatment interruption. Herein, we compare patients treated with whole-breast irradiation followed by boost compared with a cohort with a planned intercurrent radiation boost. Methods and Materials: The records of 650 consecutive breast cancer patients treated at Allegheny General Hospital (AGH) between 2000 and 2008 were reviewed. Selected for this study were 327 patients with T1 or T2 tumors treated with external beam radiotherapy postlumpectomy. One hundred and sixty-nine patients were treated by whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) followed by boost at completion. One hundred fifty-eight were treated with a planned intercurrent boost (delivered following 3,600 cGy WBRT). The mean whole breast radiation dose in the conventionally treated group was 5,032 cGy (range, 4500-5400 cGy), and the mean whole breast dose was 5,097 cGy (range, 4860-5040 cGy) in the group treated with a planned intercurrent boost. Results: The occurrence of Grade III dermatitis was significantly reduced in the WBRT/intercurrent boost group compared with the WBRT/boost group (0.6% vs. 8.9%), as was the incidence of treatment interruption (1.9% vs. 14.2%). With a median follow-up of 32 months and 27 months, respectively, no significant difference in local control was identified. Conclusions: Patients treated with intercurrent boost developed less Grade III dermatitis and unplanned treatment interruptions with similar local control. Copyright  Inc."
"Trombetta, M., et al.",2010,A volumetric model for evaluation of skin dose and correlation of toxicity in balloon-based breast brachytherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate volumetric data related to breast skin dose and correlate with clinical effects of balloon brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: The plans of 109 high dose rate balloon (63 MammoSite and 46 Contura) brachytherapy cases of early breast cancer patients were reviewed to assess skin dose and toxicity. In a review of anatomic literature, the mammary skin thickness ranges from 0.7 to 3.5 mm (mean = 2.0mm). We used the mean skin thickness to construct a volumetric representation of the skin in order to define histographic data related to this organ for standard 3-dimensional treatment planning. The PTV (planning tumor volume) for balloon brachytherapy defined by the NSABP B-39/RTOG-0413 protocol is a 1.0 cm spherical expansion of the balloon. The cases analyzed (n = 46) included only patients whose tumor cavity was <12 mm from the skin so that the PTV intersecting with the skin provided volumetric data. The data were compared to the maximum surface point dose data and correlated with acute dermal toxicity as measured by the CTCAE (v 3.0) criteria. Results: The mean maximum point surface skin dose percent (MSD) for all patients was 101.8% of prescribed (range, 75.8-131.9%) while the mean maximum volume dose percent (MVD) was 114.5% (range, 85.6-157.2). The maximal skin dose was significantly different between MSD and MVD methods (p<0.0001 with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test) because the maximal dose of the volumetric skin occurs at 2mmcloser to the balloon compared with the maximal point dose at the skin surface. A subset analysis by catheter type demonstrated no significant difference between the MammoSite or Contura applicators in either MSD (Contura, 101%; MammoSite,102.8%) or MVD (Contura, 118.8%; MammoSite, 118%). Five patients developed grade two acute reactions and one developed grade three toxicity. Of these patients, the MSD and MVD were 121.5 % and 144.3 % respectively. The skin surface to balloon distance in all of these patients was 6 mm or less. Overall long term cosmesis was unchanged in all patients. For all 46 patients, the mean maximal skin dose was 101.8% (range, 75.8-131.9) for MVD and 118.8% (range, 85.4 - 157.2) of the prescribed dose for MSD. Conclusions: Histographic volumetric data represent an improved understanding of the relationship to dose and volume in distinction to maximum point dose calculations. As balloon to skin surface distances decrease, volumetric measurements become more important. Quantification of skin volume should be considered in all brachytherapeutic cases to provide a better understanding of the relationship of dose to toxicity."
"Trovo, M., et al.",2013,Delivering adjuvant radiation therapy beyond 6 months after breast-conserving surgery does not jeopardize the locoregional control in early-stage breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To determine if a delay in radiation therapy (RT) delivering leads to an increase risk of loco-regional failure in early stage breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery without adjuvant chemotherapy. Materials/Methods: The records of all patients with stage I-II breast cancer treated with breast conserving-surgery and adjuvant RTwere retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent post-operative chemotherapy were excluded from the study. The analysis was then conducted on 294 patients. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the interval between surgery and RT: <4 months (n=136); 4-6 months (n=121); and 6-14 months (n=37). Loco-regional recurrence (LRR) was defined as clinical or radiographic recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or in the regional lymphatics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate rates of LRR, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate potential risk factors. Results: The median follow-up was of 81 months (range, 3-309 months). Median patient age was 58 years. Eighty-two (28%) patients were premenopausal; 266 (90%) were affected by invasive ductal carcinoma and 28 (10%) by invasive lobular carcinoma. Two hundred seventy (92%) women were T1, and 24 (8%) were T2; 230 (78%) were pN0, 26 (8%) pN1a mic, 31 (10%) pN1a, and 7 (2%) were Nx. Eighty-four (29%) tumors were grade 3; 276 (94%) patients were estrogen receptor positive; lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was present in 79 (27%) cases; positive pathologic margin was present in 9 (3%) cases. Two hundred forty-six (84%) patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy, and 48 (16%) received no adjuvant systemic therapy. The actuarial rates of LRR at 5 and 10 years were 5.5% and 15.2%, respectively. The actuarial rates of DFS and OS at 10 years were 82% and 96%, respectively. Statistically significant factors associated with increased risk of LRR at the univariate analysis were estrogen receptor negative cancer (p=0.04), positive pathologic margin (p=0.01), and LVI (p=0.05). Time interval between surgery and RT was not associated with increased risk of LRR. Conclusions: Delivering adjuvant radiation therapy beyond six months after breast conserving surgery does not jeopardize the loco-regional control in early stage breast cancer patients."

Materials/Methods: The records of all patients with stage I-II breast cancer treated with breast conserving-surgery and adjuvant whole breast RT were retrospectively reviewed. Loco-regional recurrence (LRR) was defined as clinical or radiographic recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or in the regional lymphatics (axilla, infra/supraclavicular nodes). Kaplan- Meier analysis was used to calculate rates of regional recurrence (RR), LRR, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate potential risk factors. Results: The study was conducted on 492 patients, and the median followup was of 95 months (range, 3-309 months). Median patient age was 54 years. One hundred eighty-five (37%) patients were premenopausal; 443 (90%) were affected by invasive ductal carcinoma and 49 (10%) by invasive lobular carcinoma.

The actuarial rates of RR at 5 and 10 years were 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively. The actuarial rates of LRR at 5 and 10 years were 5.5% and 18%, respectively. The actuarial rates of DFS and OS at 10 years were 80.5% and 96.3%, respectively. Statistically significant factors associated with increased risk of RR at the univariate analysis were node positive disease (HR=3.6, p=0.003) and the presence of LVI (HR=3.5, p=0.03). Conclusions: Patients with Stage I and II breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast RT are at a low overall risk of regional and locoregional relapse. However, patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes and with LVI are higher risk of regional recurrence, and supraclavicular nodal irradiation should be considered."

Materials/Methods: A cohort of 150 Stage I and II breast cancer patients treated with modified radical mastectomy, without adjuvant irradiation, between 1999 and 2005 was analyzed. The pattern of loco-regional recurrence was reported. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate rates of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate potential risk factors. Results: Median follow-up was 75 months (range, 10-224 months). The mean patient age was 56 years (range, 25-83 years). Ninety-one cases were T1, and 59 T2; 81 patients were pN0, 13 pN1a mic, and 56 pN1a. One hundred thirty-four were invasive ductal carcinoma, and 16 invasive lobular carcinoma. One hundred forty-three (95%) patients received adjuvant systemic therapy: 85 (57%) hormonal therapy alone, 14 (9%) chemotherapy alone, and 44 (29%) both chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Seventeen (11%) patients experienced a loco-regional relapse: 6 (4%) patients recurred in the chest wall, 6 (4%) in the infra-/supraclavicular nodes, and 5 (3%) both in the chest wall and in the infra-/supraclavicular nodes. The estimated 5-year LRR rate was 8.1%. On univariate analysis, statistically significant factors associated with increased risk of LRR were: pre-menopausal status (p = 0.004), estrogen receptor negative cancer (p = 0.02), pathologic Grade 3 (p = 0.02), and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p = 0.001). Tand N-Stage were not associated with increased risk of regional recurrence. The 5-year LRR rate for patients with zero or one, two, three, and four risk factors, was 1%, 10.3%, 24.2%, and 75%, respectively. Conclusions: This study has shown that a subset of patients with early-stage breast cancer is at high risk of loco-regional relapse, and therefore post-mastectomy irradiation might be beneficial. Relevant risk factors, such as premenopausal status, ER negative tumors, grading and LVI, should be considered besides TNM stage. Relapse occurred in the chest wall and in the regional lymph nodes with the same frequency. We have found an equal proportion between the chest wall and regional lymph nodes as sites of relapse. Post-mastectomy irradiation, if indicated, should include both the chest wall and the regional lymph nodes."
"Trovo, M., et al.",2015,Five year results with 3-D conformal radiation therapy to deliver partial-breast irradiation consisting of 40 GY in 10 daily fractions.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To report the 5-year results of a prospective phase II study of Partial Brest Irradiation (PBI) consisting of 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Materials/Methods: Patients affected by early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in this phase II trial. Patients had to be 60 years old and treated with breast conservative surgery for early stage (pT1-T2 pN0- N1a) invasive ductal carcinoma. Patients affected by ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive lobular carcinoma were not included in this study. Radiation therapy consisted of 40 Gy delivered in 10 daily fractions, 4 Gy/fraction. Treatment volumes and radiation therapy planning were based on NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 guidelines. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate rates of local control (LC), loco-regional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). Toxicity was scored using the CTCAV v3.0. Results: Eighty patients were enrolled. Median age was 69 years. Eightyfive percent had stage I disease, and 86% were ER positive. Seventeen (21%) patients had lymphovascular space invasion. Median follow-up was 52 months (range, 17-79 months). Three patients experienced local relapse (1 in-field, 1 out-of-field, 1 diffuse DCIS), corresponding to 5-year LC of 96.2%. One patient experienced an axillary relapse, and the 5-year LRC was 95%. Two patients experienced contralateral breast cancer. One patient died of disease (distant failure 9 months after PBI), and 2 died for intercurrence illness; 5-year OS was 94%. The proposed schedule was well tolerated. One patient reported Grade 3 pain at the site of irradiation. Four (5%) patients experienced Grade 2 erythema. Late Grade 2 fibrosis was observed in 3 (4%) patients. Asymptomatic fat necrosis was documented in 3 (4%) cases. Conclusion: Forty Gy in 10 daily fractions is a well-tolerated regimen to deliver PBI. Initial efficacy appears comparable to other experiences using the classical RTOG fractionation of 38.5 Gy in 10 BID fractions."
"Trovo, M., et al.",2011,External beam partial breast irradiation using 4 gy delivered once a day in 10 fractions: Toxicity and cosmesis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To assess the toxicity and cosmetic results in early stage breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant partial breast irradiation (PBI) to a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions (4 Gy/fraction). Materials/Methods: From February 2009 to December 2010, 57 patients were enrolled in this phase II trial. To be included in this study patients had to be 60 years old and treated with breast conservative surgery for early stage (pT1-T2 pN0-N1a) invasive ductal carcinoma. Treatment volumes and radiation therapy planning were based on NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 guidelines. Patients were treated once a day, for 10 days, with 4 Gy per fraction and a total dose of 40 Gy. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (v3.0), including pain, erythema, hyperpigmentation and fibrosis. Cosmesis was assessed using the Harvard scale. Toxicity and cosmetic results were evaluated by a radiation oncologist at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the end of radiation. Dosimetric parameters and grade of toxicity were correlated. Results: Median follow-up was 12 months (range, 6-24 months). The median age was 70 years (range, 60-80 years). The tumor phenotypes were as follows: 48 (85%) ER/PgR positive-Her2 negative 48, 3 (5%) ER/PgR negative Her2 positive, and 6 (10%) triple-negative. Fifty (88%) were T1 and 7 (12%) were T2 tumors. Forty-eight (85%) were N0 and 9 (15%) were N1a. Six (10%) patients received chemotherapy, 36 (63%) received hormonal therapy. The mean PTV-EVAL size was 195 cc (range, 73-380 cc), mean PTV-EVAL to whole breast volume ratio was 0.18 (range, 0.1-0.28). There were no cases of Grade 3-4 acute toxicity; two patients (3.5%) showed Grade 2 skin toxicity. Two patients (3.5%) had Grade 3 late toxicity: one pain that required narcotics, and one fibrosis. No statistical correlation between dosimetric parameters and toxicity was found. Overall cosmetic outcome was assessed good/excellent in 54 (95%) patients and poor in 3 (5%) patients. Conclusions: This accelerated partial breast fractionation scheme of 10 ''once-a-day'' fraction of 4 Gy to a total dose of 40 Gy resulted in a well-tolerated regimen, with minimal severe toxicity. Longer follow-up is needed to further ascertain the late toxicity of this radiation schedule."
"Truong, P. T., et al.",2004,A positive margin is not always an indication for radiotherapy after mastectomy in early breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Objective: Postoperative radiotherapy is frequently employed among breast cancer patients with positive surgical margins after mastectomy but there is little evidence to support this practice. This study examined relapse and survival among women with node-negative breast cancer and positive surgical margins after mastectomy. Methods: Among 2570 women diagnosed between 1989 and 1998 and referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency with pathologic (p)T1-2, pN0 invasive breast cancer treated with mastectomy, 94 had positive surgical margins and formed the study cohort. Women with more established indications for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) including T3-4 tumors or node-positive disease were excluded. Demographic, tumor, and treatment factors; relapse patterns; and Kaplan-Meier 8-year locoregional relapse-free, breast cancer-specific, and overall survival rates were compared between women who were treated with (n = 41) and without (n = 53) PMRT. Results: Median follow-up time was 7.7 years. The distributions of age, histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), estrogen receptor status, and number of axillary nodes removed were similar between the two treatment groups. Six local chest wall recurrences (6.4%), 4 regional recurrences (4.3%), and 11 distant recurrences (11.7%) were identified. Local relapse rates were 2.4% vs. 9.4% (p = 0.23), and regional relapse rates were 2.4% vs. 5.7% (p = 0.63), with and without PMRT, respectively. Trends for higher cumulative locoregional relapse (LRR) rates without PMRT were identified in the presence of age ≤50 years (LRR 20% without vs. 0% with PMRT), T2 tumor size (19.2% vs. 6.9%), grade III disease (23.1% vs. 6.7%), and LVI (16.7% vs. 9.1%). Statistical significance was not demonstrated in these differences (p > 0.10), possibly because of the small number of events. In patients with age >50 years, T1 tumors, grade I/II disease, and absence of LVI, no locoregional relapse occurred even with positive margins. PMRT did not improve distant relapse, 8-year breast cancer-specific and overall survival rates. Conclusion: This study suggests that not all patients with node-negative breast cancer with positive margins after mastectomy require radiotherapy. Locoregional failure rates approximating 20% were observed in women with positive margins plus at least one of the following factors: age ≤50 years, T2 tumor size, grade III histology, or LVI. The absolute and relative improvements in locoregional control with radiotherapy in these situations support the judicious, but not routine, use of PMRT for positive margins after mastectomy in patients with node-negative breast cancer.

"Turner, B. C., et al.",2000,Cyclin D1 expression and early breast cancer recurrence following lumpectomy and radiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of cyclin D1 (cycD1) levels in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) following lumpectomy and radiation therapy. Methods and Materials: A total of 98 patients (49 patients with IBTR and 49 matched cases without IBTR) selected from our conservatively treated breast cancer population served as the patient population for the current study. All patients were treated with lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy to the intact breast to a total median dose of 64 Gy. The patients were followed in our clinic with a median follow-up of 13 years. Immunohistochemical analysis of cycD1 in these 98 early-stage breast cancer patients was performed using a polyclonal antibody generated against the human cycD1 protein. All clinical, pathologic, and molecular variables were entered into a computerized data base for statistical analysis. Results: Low levels of immunohistochemically detected cycD1 protein correlated with IBTR (p = 0.001), but there was no association between cycD1 protein levels and metastatic disease, axillary lymph node involvement, distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS). Subgroup analysis revealed that for early breast tumor relapses (within 4 years of initial breast tumor diagnosis), low levels of cycD1 were associated with IBTR (p = 0.004), but cycD1 expression was not prognostic for IBTR from breast cancer patients with late relapses (p = NS). Conclusion: These studies provide in vivo evidence for the prognostic and biologic significance of cycD1 expression in determining response to radiation therapy in breast cancer patients.

"Vaidya, J. S., et al.",2016,Reduced Mortality With Partial-Breast Irradiation for Early Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose With earlier detection and more effective treatment, mortality from breast cancer continues to fall and it has become increasingly important to reduce the toxicity of treatments. Partial-breast radiation therapy, which focuses radiation to the tumor bed, may achieve this aim. We analyzed mortality differences in randomized trials of partial-breast irradiation (PBI). Methods and Materials We included data from published randomized trials of PBI (alone or as part of a risk-adapted approach) versus whole-breast irradiation (WBI) for invasive breast cancer suitable for breast-conserving therapy. We identified trials using PubMed and Google searches with the terms “partial breast irradiation” OR “intraoperative radiotherapy” OR “IMRT” OR (“accelerated” AND “radiation”) AND “randomised/randomized,” as well as through discussion with colleagues in the field. We calculated the proportion of patients who had events in each randomized arm at 5 years' follow-up and created a forest plot using Stata, version 14.1. Results We identified 9 randomized trials of PBI versus WBI in invasive breast cancer; 5-year outcomes were available for non–breast cancer mortality in 5 trials (n=4489) and for breast cancer mortality in 4 trials (n=4231). The overall mortality was 4.9%. There was no detectable heterogeneity between the trials for any of the outcomes. There was no difference in the proportion of patients dying of breast cancer (difference, 0.000% [95% confidence interval (CI), −0.7 to +0.7]; P=.999). Non–breast cancer mortality with PBI was lower than with WBI (difference, 1.1% [95% CI, −2.1% to −0.2%]; P=.023). Total mortality with PBI was also lower than with WBI (difference, 1.3% [95% CI, −2.5% to 0.0%]; P=.05). Conclusions Use of PBI instead of WBI in selected patients results in a lower 5-year non–breast cancer and overall mortality, amounting to a 25% reduction in relative terms. This information should be included when breast-conserving therapy is proposed to a patient."
"Vaidya, J. S., et al.",2010,"Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy versus whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer (TARGIT-A trial): An international, prospective, randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 trial.",The Lancet,"Background After breast-conserving surgery, 90% of local recurrences occur within the index quadrant despite the presence of multicentric cancers elsewhere in the breast. Thus, restriction of radiation therapy to the tumour bed during surgery might be adequate for selected patients. We compared targeted intraoperative radiotherapy with the conventional policy of whole breast external beam radiotherapy. Methods Having safely piloted the new technique of single-dose targeted intraoperative radiotherapy with Intrabeam, we launched the TARGIT-A trial on March 24, 2000. In this prospective, randomised, non-inferiority trial, women aged 45 years or older with invasive ductal breast carcinoma undergoing breast-conserving surgery were enrolled from 28 centres in nine countries. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive targeted intraoperative radiotherapy or whole breast external beam radiotherapy, with blocks stratified by centre and by timing of delivery of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy. Neither patients nor investigators or their teams were masked to treatment assignment. Postoperative discovery of predefined factors (eg, lobular carcinoma) could trigger addition of external beam radiotherapy to targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (in an expected 15% of patients). The primary outcome was local recurrence in the conserved breast. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an absolute difference of 2·5% in the primary endpoint. All randomised patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00983684. Findings 1113 patients were randomly allocated to targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and 1119 were allocated to external beam radiotherapy. Of 996 patients who received the allocated treatment in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy group, 854 (86%) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy only and 142 (14%) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy plus external beam radiotherapy. 1025 (92%) patients in the external beam radiotherapy group received the allocated treatment. At 4 years, there were six local recurrences in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and five in the external beam radiotherapy group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence in the conserved breast at 4 years was 1·20% (95% CI 0·53-2·71) in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and 0·95% (0·39-2·31) in the external beam radiotherapy group (difference between groups 0·25%, -1·04 to 1·54; p=0·41). The frequency of any complications and major toxicity was similar in the two groups (for major toxicity, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, 37 [3·3%] of 1113 vs external beam radiotherapy, 44 [3·9%] of 1119; p=0·44). Radiotherapy toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3) was lower in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy group (six patients [0·5%]) than in the external beam radiotherapy group (23 patients [2·1%]; p=0·002). Interpretation For selected patients with early breast cancer, a single dose of radiotherapy delivered at the time of surgery by use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to external beam radiotherapy delivered over several weeks.

"van der Laan, H. P., et al.",2007,Three-Dimensional Conformal Simultaneously Integrated Boost Technique for Breast-Conserving Radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare the target coverage and normal tissue dose with the simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) and the sequential boost technique in breast cancer, and to evaluate the incidence of acute skin toxicity in patients treated with the SIB technique. Methods and Materials: Thirty patients with early-stage left-sided breast cancer underwent breast-conserving radiotherapy using the SIB technique. The breast and boost planning target volumes (PTVs) were treated simultaneously (i.e., for each fraction, the breast and boost PTVs received 1.81 Gy and 2.3 Gy, respectively). Three-dimensional conformal beams with wedges were shaped and weighted using forward planning. Dose-volume histograms of the PTVs and organs at risk with the SIB technique, 28 × (1.81 + 0.49 Gy), were compared with those for the sequential boost technique, 25 × 2 Gy + 8 × 2 Gy. Acute skin toxicity was evaluated for 90 patients treated with the SIB technique according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Results: PTV coverage was adequate with both techniques. With SIB, more efficiently shaped boost beams resulted in smaller irradiated volumes. The mean volume receiving ≥107% of the breast dose was reduced by 20%, the mean volume outside the boost PTV receiving ≥95% of the boost dose was reduced by 54%, and the mean heart and lung dose were reduced by 10%. Of the evaluated patients, 32.2% had Grade 2 or worse toxicity. Conclusion: The SIB technique is proposed for standard use in breast-conserving radiotherapy because of its dose-limiting capabilities, easy implementation, reduced number of treatment fractions, and relatively low incidence of acute skin toxicity.

"VanderWalde, N. A., et al.",2011,Local recurrence outcomes in phase II clinical trial using single dose intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) before surgical excision of early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To report the 5-year rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence in our study of IORT delivered before tumor excision for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Patients age 48 or older with invasive ductal cancers smaller than 3 cm as measured on ultrasound and clinically negative lymph nodes were eligible for treatment on this IRB-approved Phase II trial. Ultrasound image was used to select electron energy and cone size sufficient to cover the tumor plus a 1.5 to 2.0 cm lateral margin and 1 cm deep margin (90% Isodose). The dose was prescribed to 15 Gy and delivered using a Mobetron irradiator. The patients then had immediate lumpectomy following the IORT.We update the local control results, using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate time to local recurrence function and 95% confidence intervals. Results: From March 2003 to July 2007, 71 patients were treated with IORT. Median follow-up was 48 months (range, 3 - 63 months). Median age of all patients was 64 (48 - 92), median tumor size was 1.5 cm (range, 0.3 - 4.0 cm), median cone size was 5.5 cm (range, 4 - 6 cm), median electron energy used was 12 MeV (range, 6 - 12). Hormone receptor status were as follows: 46 were ER+/PR+/Her2-, 4 patients were ER+/PR-/Her2-, 12 patients were triple negative, and 8 patients were Her2 positive (1 ER+/ PR-, 3 triple positive, 4 ER-/PR-). There were 17 patients who received systemic chemotherapy, 38 patients who received hormonal therapy, and 23 patients who received no systemic therapy. For patients found to have tumors greater than 3 cm, extensive intraductal component, or positive nodes or margins, additional local therapy was delivered (7 total mastectomy, 11 whole breast radiation). Of the 53 patients who received IORTalone, 5 have experienced ipsilateral tumor recurrence, for a crude local control rate of 48 of 53 (90.5%; 95% confidence interval, 79 - 97%). The 3-year and 5-year probability of local control are 94% (95% CI, 82 - 98%) and 77% (95% CI, 46 - 92%). Of the 5 patients who recurred 3 were ER+/PR+/Her2- and 2 were triple negative. Two received tamoxifen alone, 1 received chemotherapy alone, and two received no systemic therapy. In addition there were 3 patients in the IORT alone group who died without evidence of breast cancer progression for an overall survival of 92.4%. Of the 71 patients in this trial, 23 patients (32.3%) required additional definitive treatment for local control at the time of initial therapy. Conclusions: The 10% crude rate of local failure and the 77% 5-year probability of local control are concerning. Based on these findings, preoperative IORT, as planned and delivered in this study with a 15 Gy prescription dose, may not provide adequate local control for patients with early-stage breast cancer."

To match the IORT cohort, 258 pts postoperatively treated with EBRT were selected, thus a total of 516 pts were analyzed. Pts were matched by age (≤49, 50-59, ≥ 60), histology (infiltrating ductal, lobular, tubular, mixed, other type and ductal carcinoma in situ), tumor size (≤0.5, 0.5- 1, 1.1-2, 2.1-3, > 3 cm), grading (1, 2, 3), lymph node classes (0, 1, 2), hormone receptors, type of adjuvant therapy (none or hormone therapy vs chemotherapy), surgical margins (positive, negative, close) and treatment date. EBRT was performed with 2 tangential fields to the whole breast (50 Gy/25 fractions) and with a 9-12 MeV direct electron field boost to the tumor bed (10 Gy/5 fractions). IORT was performed on a non-dedicated Linac (green-line setup) with direct 8- 12 MeV electron fields (21 Gy prescribed to the 90% isodose). Relapse at the site of surgical intervention was classified as true local recurrence (LR). All recurrences in the treated breast (any quadrant) were classified as Ipsilateral Recurrence (IR). Results: Median follow-up was 77 months (12-156) for both groups, reflecting matched treatment dates. IR were 11 (4.2 %) after IORT and 7 (2.7%) after EBRT. LR for IORT and EBRT groups were 8 (3.1%) and 3 (1.2%), respectively. Overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years was 98.8% and 96.1% for IORT and 98.8% and 95.3% for EBRT (n.s.). Disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 5 years was 97.2% and 93.2% for IORT and 98% and 93.5% for EBRT (n.s). Between IORT and EBRT, no differences in non-breast cancer related deaths (n = 12 vs 11) or second cancer incidence (n=6 vs 5) were recorded. When patients were analyzed according to ASTRO-criteria for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), outcome was better in the APBI-suitable group than in the entire cohort: IR were 2 (1.8%) for IORT and 2 (1.8%) for EBRT. LR was 1 (0.9%) for IORT and 2 (1.8%) for EBRT and OS at 3 and 5 years remained at 99.1% and 96.1% for IORT and at 100% and 95.1% for EBRT. DFS was 99.1% and 96.5% for IORT and for EBRT 100% and 95.1% for EBRT at 3 and 5 years. Conclusions: In line with published data from randomized trials, the rate of IR was higher after IORT than after EBRT if no stringent patient selection was performed. Non-breast-cancer mortality and second cancer incidence did not differ between IORT and EBRT. In patients considered suitable for APBI according to ASTRO-criteria, IR, LR, and OS, indicating that IORT is a viable treatment paradigm after careful patient selection."
"Vapiwala, N., et al.",2007,Biopsy Findings After Breast Conservation Therapy for Early-Stage Invasive Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the patterns and factors predictive of positive ipsilateral breast biopsy after conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective review of Stage I-II breast cancer patients initially treated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy between 1977 and 1996, who later underwent post-treatment ipsilateral breast biopsies. Results: A total of 223 biopsies were performed in 193 treated breasts: 171 single and 22 multiple biopsies. Of the 223 biopsies, 56% were positive and 44% were negative for recurrence. The positive biopsy rate (PBR) was 59% for the first and 32% for subsequent biopsies. The median time to the first post-treatment biopsy was 49 months. Of the patients with negative initial biopsy findings, 11% later developed local recurrence. The PBR was 40% among patients with physical examination findings only, 65% with mammographic abnormalities only, and 79% with both findings (p = 0.001). Analysis of the procedure type revealed a PBR of 86% for core and 58% for excisional biopsies compared with 28% for aspiration cytology alone (p = 0.025). The PBR varied inversely with age at the original diagnosis: 49% if ≥51 years, 57% if 36-50 years, and 83% if ≤35 years (p = 0.05). The PBR correlated directly with the interval after radiotherapy: 49% if ≤60 months, 59% if 60.1-120 months, 77% if 120.1-180 months, and 100% if >180 months after completing postlumpectomy radiotherapy (p = 0.01). The PBR was not linked with recurrence location, initial pathologic T or N stage, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status, or final pathologic margins (all p ≥ 0.15). Conclusion: After definitive radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer, a greater PBR was associated with the presence of both mammographic and clinical abnormalities, excisional or core biopsies, younger age at the initial diagnosis, and longer intervals after radiotherapy completion.

"Veldwijk, M., et al.",2016,Association of T lymphocyte apoptosis after in vitro irradiation with normal tissue late toxicity after radiation therapy in 252 breast cancer patients with 10-year clinical follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Improvements in the treatment of breast cancer have resulted in a rise in the number of long-term survivors. However, late toxicities after radiotherapy (RT) still limit the dose that can be applied to tumors. Previously, a predictive test was proposed based on an association between high T-lymphocyte apoptosis after irradiation in vitro and reduced risk of overall late toxicity at two years follow-up in a cohort of mixed cancer types (Ozsahin et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005;11:7426-7433). The aim of the present study was to test the association for specific late endpoints (fibrosis, telangiectasia) in 252 breast cancer patients with 10 year clinical follow-up. Materials/Methods: A total of 252 female patients with histologically confirmed early breast cancer or in situ from the German ISE cohort received breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant RT. Peripheral blood was obtained from each patient, stored at room temperature for 24h, then 1:10 diluted in medium, irradiated (0 vs 8 Gy; 6 MV X-rays) and incubated at 37°C for 48h. The apoptosis rates of CD4+ T-helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, as well as CD3-/CD8+ NK cells were measured using three color flow cytometry (FACS). At follow-up after at least 10 years, RT-induced side effects were scored for each patient according to the LENT-SOMA scale. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used for dichotomous (toxicity grade 0 + 1 vs grade 2 + 3) comparisons. Results: Highly significant associations between the radiation-induced apoptosis rate and patient's fibrosis (P = 0.011) or telangiectasia status (P < 0.001) were found for CD4+ cells. For CD8+ cells, apoptosis was only significant for telangiectasia (P = 0.001) while NK cells (CD3/CD8+) showed a high rate of apoptosis which did not correlate with late side effects. Of note, for CD4+ cells, 77% (17/22) of patients with telangiectasia were in the lowest tertile of the samples ranked by apoptosis rates after in vitro irradiation, whereas only 53% (38/72) of patients with fibrosis were in this tertile. Conclusion: A correlation between the apoptosis rates after in vitro irradiation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations and specific late effects of RT in breast cancer patients was demonstrated. In the present breast cancer patient cohort, the apoptosis rate in CD4+ T lymphocytes after in vitro irradiation was a better predictor for telangiectasia than for fibrosis. Currently, a multi-center prospective study (“REQUITE”) funded by the European Union is being performed to validate the assay on a larger patient cohort including additional malignancies (prostate and lung cancer patients)."

Methods and materials: From November 2003 to June 2006, 60 breasts on 59 patients were treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) APBI. Patients with stage 0, I, or II breast cancer were eligible if a < 3-cm tumor was resected with negative surgical margins, and axillary evaluation documented 0-3 positive nodes. The mean age was 58.7 years (range, 31-88 years). Target volume and critical structure definitions, as well as dose delivery guidelines, were consistent across both institutions. Treatment was twice daily for 5 consecutive days with 3.85 Gy per fraction to 38.5 Gy. Clinical follow-up was conducted at regular intervals that included history, physical exam, and mammography. The overall cosmesis was graded using the Harvard scale and toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (v4.0), including hyperpigmentation, edema, telangiectasia, mastalgia, surgical defect, fibrosis, and fat necrosis. Dose-volume histogram and treatment parameters were collected and analyzed. Results: At a mean follow-up of 44.3 months (range, 2-94 months), there were 4 cases of grade 3-4 toxicity (7%): 1 patient with mastalgia; 1 patient with mastalgia and fat necrosis; 1 patient with telangiectasia; and 1 patient with fibrosis. There was no statistical correlate between dosimetric parameters and cosmetic outcome. Overall cosmetic outcome was good or excellent in 58 breasts (95%) and fair to poor"" in 3 (5%). There were no local-regional failures; 3 patients failed distantly (5%). Conclusions: Accelerated partial breast irradiation using 3D-CRT is safe and the risk of serious chronic side effect is low and acceptable.  American Society for Radiation Oncology."""
"Vera, R. B., et al.",2011,Margin status an indication for accelerated partial breast irradiation in early-stage breast cancers.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We report the five-year data from a single-institution review of women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conservation therapy using accelerated partial breast radiation (APBI). Materials/Methods: An IRB-approved review of 165 consecutive early-stage breast cancers, treated from 1995-2005 with APBI brachytherapy, reveals 91 cases were treated with interstitial brachytherapy and 74 with balloon brachytherapy. Stage 0, I, or II cancers are eligible for APBI if a<3cm tumor resects with a negative pathologic margin and 0-3 involved nodes. High-dose-rate radiation therapy is delivered twice a day, for five days, to a total dose of 34 Gy. Follow-up at regular intervals documents history, physical examination, and mammography. Physicians use the Harvard scale to grade overall cosmesis, and toxicities, including hyperpigmentation, edema, telangiectasia, pain, surgical defect, fibrosis and fat necrosis, are graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (v3.0). Dose-volume histogram and treatment parameters are collected and analyzed. Results: Median follow-up is 59.9 months, with 40% of patients having .70 months follow-up. The median patient age at diagnosis is 70.9 years. Median tumor size is 1.1 cm. The pathologic margin is #2 mm in 57 tumors (35%). Tumors are ER+ in 76% of cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 13% of patients and 52% received hormone therapy. Locoregional control of disease is achieved in 98.2% of patients. There are three ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR), occurring at 50, 81, and 158 months. Overall cosmetic outcome is good/excellent in 90% of patients and fair/poor in 5.4%, 8 patients have no scored cosmesis. There are 7 cases of G3-4 toxicity: 3 with fibrosis and 4 with surgical defects. The most common toxicities are fibrosis G1 (49%), G2 (13%), followed by scarring G1 (37%), G2 (2%), and surgical defects G1 (16%), G2 (6%). With few events, IBTR and cosmesis were not found to have any statistical correlation with the clinical or dosimetric parameters evaluated. Specifically, when the maximum skin dose is<120% of the prescribed dose there was no correlation with skin toxicity. Conclusions: These excellent local control rates and cosmesis support the continued use of APBI. The ASTRO Consensus guidelines for APBI requires a .2 mm pathologic margin in contrast to the NSABP B-39 criteria of no tumor at the histologic inked margin. Over a third of patients in this series have #2 mm of the margin with no increase in IBTR. In this cohort of patients with close margins, brachytherapy delivers substantial dose that achieves local control and spares the morbidity and negative cosmetic impact of additional breast surgery."

B., et al.",2010,Cosmesis and toxicity following 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in the delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate cosmesis and toxicity for early stage breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant 3D-CRT to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Materials/Methods: From 2003-June 2006, 61 breasts on 60 patients were treated with 3D-CRT APBI at Virginia Commonwealth University and Allegheny General Hospital. Patients with Stage 0, I, or II breast cancer were eligible if a <3cm tumor was resected with negative surgical margins and axillary evaluation documented 0-3 positive nodes. Target volume and critical structure definitions, as well as dose delivery guidelines, were consistent across both institutions. Patients were treated twice a day, for five days, with 3.85 Gy per fraction and a total dose of 38.5 Gy. Clinical follow-up was conducted at regular intervals that included history, physical exam, and mammography. The overall cosmesis was a physician-graded assessment using the Harvard scale and toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (v3.0) including hyperpigmentation, edema, telangectasia, pain, surgical defect, fibrosis and fat necrosis. Dose-volume histogram and treatment parameters were collected and analyzed. Results: Median follow-up was 18.4 months (range, 2.0-70.2). The median age was 58.7 years (range, 31.4-88.2). Median tumor size was 1.0 cm (range, 0.2-2.5) with the following tumor characteristics: invasive histology 82%; non-invasive histology 18%; ER positive 80%; Her2 positive 8%. Median PTV-Eval size was 206.9cc's (range, 89.2-1052.0. Median PTV-Eval to whole breast volume ratio was 14% (range, 5-30%). Eight (13%) of patients received chemotherapy, 41 (68%) received hormonal therapy. There were no local regional failures and three patients failed distantly (5%). Overall cosmetic outcome was good/excellent in 58 breasts (95%) and fair/poor in three (5%). There were four cases (7%) of grade 3-4 toxicity: one patient with pain; one patient with pain and fat necrosis; one patient with telangectasias; and one patient with fibrosis. No statistical correlation between dosimetric parameters and cosmetic outcome were identified. Conclusions: The size of treatment cohort and length of follow-up of this experience of 3D-CRT APBI are consistent with data reported by other series. This experience supports the continued on-protocol use of this technique with acceptably low toxicity rates and good/excellent cosmetic outcome in the majority of patients."
"Vicini, F., et al.",2011,Five-Year analysis of treatment efficacy and cosmesis by the American society of breast surgeons mammosite breast brachytherapy registry trial in patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To present 5-year data on treatment efficacy, cosmetic results, and toxicities for patients enrolled on the American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite breast brachytherapy registry trial. Methods and Materials: A total of 1440 patients (1449 cases) with early-stage breast cancer receiving breast-conserving therapy were treated with the MammoSite device to deliver accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) (34 Gy in 3.4-Gy fractions). Of 1449 cases, 1255 (87%) had invasive breast cancer (IBC) (median size, 10 mm) and 194 (13%) had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (median size, 8 mm). Median follow-up was 54 months. Results: Thirty-seven cases (2.6%) developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), for a 5-year actuarial rate of 3.80% (3.86% for IBC and 3.39% for DCIS). Negative estrogen receptor status (p = 0.0011) was the only clinical, pathologic, or treatment-related variable associated with IBTR for patients with IBC and young age (<50 years; p = 0.0096) and positive margin status (p = 0.0126) in those with DCIS. The percentage of breasts with good/excellent cosmetic results at 60 months (n = 371) was 90.6%. Symptomatic breast seromas were reported in 13.0% of cases, and 2.3% developed fat necrosis. A subset analysis of the first 400 consecutive cases enrolled was performed (352 with IBC, 48 DCIS). With a median follow-up of 60.5 months, the 5-year actuarial rate of IBTR was 3.04%. Conclusion: Treatment efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity 5 years after treatment with APBI using the MammoSite device are good and similar to those reported with other forms of APBI with similar follow-up.

"Vicini, F., et al.",1993,The use of iodine-125 seeds as a substitute for iridium-192 seeds in temporary interstitial breast implants.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We have previously reported that the use of iodine-125 seeds in temporary plastic tube interstitial implants may be more advantageous than iridium-192 seeds due to less patient and personnel radiation exposure, reduced shielding requirements, and significant dosimetric advantages. The impact of this isotope on the rate of local control and cosmetic outcome in patients with early stage breast cancer treated with interstitial implants for their irradiation 'boost' remains to be defined. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the treatment outcome of 402 consecutive cases of Stage I and II breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy between 1/1/80 and 12/31/87. All patients underwent excisional biopsy and received 45-50 Gy to the entire breast followed by a boost to the tumor bed using either electrons (104 patients), photons (15 patients), or an interstitial implant with either iridium-192 (197 patients) or iodine-125 (86 patients) to at least 60 Gy. Iodine-125 implants were primarily performed in patients with significant risk factors for local recurrence (71%) or in patients with large breasts (17%). Local tumor control and cosmetic outcome were assessed and contrasted between patients boosted with each modality. Results: With a median follow- up of 59.3 months, 18 (4.5%) patients developed a recurrence of the tumor in the treated breast (4.4% 5-year actuarial rate). No statistically significant differences in the 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence were noted between patients boosted with either iodine-125 (3.0%), iridium-192 (3.8%), electrons (5.4%), or photons (0%). Likewise, no significant differences in the percentage of patients obtaining good/excellent cosmetic results were noted between iodine-125 (93%), iridium-192 (88%), electrons (90%), or photons (82%). Conclusion: We conclude that patients with Stage I and II breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy and judged to be candidates for boosts with interstitial implants can be effectively treated with iodine-125 seeds. Use of this isotope results in less patient and personnel irradiation exposure and a better dose distribution than iridium- 192, since dose optimization can be routinely employed. Overall, local control and cosmetic outcome have been excellent and are similar to either iridium-192, electrons, or photons."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2007,Long-Term Efficacy and Patterns of Failure After Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation: A Molecular Assay-Based Clonality Evaluation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the long-term efficacy and cosmetic results of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) by reviewing our institution's experience. Methods and Materials: A total of 199 patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated prospectively with adjuvant APBI after lumpectomy using interstitial brachytherapy. All patients had negative margins, 82% had Stage I disease, median tumor size was 1.1 cm, and 12% had positive lymph nodes. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 8.6 years. Fifty-three patients (27%) have been followed for ≥10 years. Results: Six ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTRs) were observed, for a 5-year and 10-year actuarial rate of 1.6% and 3.8%, respectively. A total of three regional nodal failures were observed, for a 10-year actuarial rate of 1.6%. Five contralateral breast cancers developed, for a 5- and 10-year actuarial rate of 2.2% and 5.2%, respectively. The type of IBTR (clonally related vs. clonally distinct) was analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based loss of heterozygosity assay. Eighty-three percent of IBTRs (n = 5) were classified as clonally related. Multiple clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related factors were analyzed for an association with the development of an IBTR, regional nodal failure, or contralateral breast cancer. On multivariate analysis, no variable was associated with any of these events. Cosmetic results were rated as excellent/good in 99% of patients. Conclusions: Long-term results with APBI using interstitial brachytherapy continue to demonstrate excellent long-term local and regional control rates and cosmetic results. According to a polymerase chain reaction-based loss of heterozygosity assay, 83% of recurrences were classified as clonally related.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2019,"Long-term primary results of accelerated partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer: a randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial.",The Lancet,"Background: Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage breast cancer decreases ipsilateral breast-tumour recurrence (IBTR), yielding comparable results to mastectomy. It is unknown whether accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) to only the tumour-bearing quadrant, which shortens treatment duration, is equally effective. In our trial, we investigated whether APBI provides equivalent local tumour control after lumpectomy compared with whole-breast irradiation. Methods: We did this randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) in 154 clinical centres in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and Israel. Adult women (>18 years) with early-stage (0, I, or II; no evidence of distant metastases, but up to three axillary nodes could be positive) breast cancer (tumour size ≤3 cm; including all histologies and multifocal breast cancers), who had had lumpectomy with negative (ie, no detectable cancer cells) surgical margins, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a biased-coin-based minimisation algorithm to receive either whole-breast irradiation (whole-breast irradiation group) or APBI (APBI group). Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38·5 Gy of external bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period. Randomisation was stratified by disease stage, menopausal status, hormone-receptor status, and intention to receive chemotherapy. Patients, investigators, and statisticians could not be masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome of invasive and non-invasive IBTR as a first recurrence was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, excluding those patients who were lost to follow-up, with an equivalency test on the basis of a 50% margin increase in the hazard ratio (90% CI for the observed HR between 0·667 and 1·5 for equivalence) and a Cox proportional hazard model. Survival was assessed by intention to treat, and sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00103181. Findings: Between March 21, 2005, and April 16, 2013, 4216 women were enrolled. 2109 were assigned to the whole-breast irradiation group and 2107 were assigned to the APBI group. 70 patients from the whole-breast irradiation group and 14 from the APBI group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up at this stage, so 2039 and 2093 patients respectively were available for survival analysis. Further, three and four patients respectively were lost to clinical follow-up (ie, survival status was assessed by phone but no physical examination was done), leaving 2036 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in the APBI group evaluable for the primary outcome. At a median follow-up of 10·2 years (IQR 7·5–11·5), 90 (4%) of 2089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an IBTR (HR 1·22, 90% CI 0·94–1·58). The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 4·6% (95% CI 3·7–5·7) in the APBI group versus 3·9% (3·1–5·0) in the whole-breast irradiation group. 44 (2%) of 2039 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 49 (2%) of 2093 patients in the APBI group died from recurring breast cancer. There were no treatment-related deaths. Second cancers and treatment-related toxicities were similar between the two groups. 2020 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in APBI group had available data on adverse events. The highest toxicity grade reported was: grade 1 in 845 (40%), grade 2 in 921 (44%), and grade 3 in 201 (10%) patients in the APBI group, compared with grade 1 in 626 (31%), grade 2 in 1193 (59%), and grade 3 in 143 (7%) in the whole-breast irradiation group. Interpretation: APBI did not meet the criteria for equivalence to whole-breast irradiation in controlling IBTR for breast-conserving therapy. Our trial ha broad eligibility criteria, leading to a large, heterogeneous pool of patients and sufficient power to detect treatment equivalence, but was not designed to test equivalence in patient subgroups or outcomes from different APBI techniques. For patients with early-stage breast cancer, our findings support whole-breast irradiation following lumpectomy; however, with an absolute difference of less than 1% in the 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR, APBI might be an acceptable alternative for some women.

"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2007,Interim Cosmetic Results and Toxicity Using 3D Conformal External Beam Radiotherapy to Deliver Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation in Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer Treated With Breast-Conserving Therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present our ongoing clinical experience utilizing three-dimensional (3D)-conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Methods and Materials: Ninety-one consecutive patients were treated with APBI using our previously reported 3D-CRT technique. The clinical target volume consisted of the lumpectomy cavity plus a 10- to 15 -mm margin. The prescribed dose was 34 or 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions given over 5 consecutive days. The median follow-up was 24 months. Twelve patients have been followed for ≥4 years, 20 for ≥3.5 years, 29 for >3.0 years, 33 for ≥2.5 years, and 46 for ≥2.0 years. Results: No local recurrences developed. Cosmetic results were rated as good/excellent in 100% of evaluable patients at ≥ 6 months (n = 47), 93% at 1 year (n = 43), 91% at 2 years (n = 21), and in 90% at ≥3 years (n = 10). Erythema, hyperpigmentation, breast edema, breast pain, telangiectasias, fibrosis, and fat necrosis were evaluated at 6, 24, and 36 months after treatment. All factors stabilized by 3 years posttreatment with grade I or II rates of 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 9%, 18%, and 9%, respectively. Only 2 patients (3%) developed grade III toxicity (breast pain), which resolved with time. Conclusions: Delivery of APBI with 3D-CRT resulted in minimal chronic (≥6 months) toxicity to date with good/excellent cosmetic results. Additional follow-up is needed to assess the long-term efficacy of this form of APBI.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",1997,Low-dose-rate brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality in the management of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast- conserving therapy: Preliminary results of a pilot trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present the preliminary findings of our in-house protocol treating the tumor bed alone after lumpectomy with low-dose-rate (LDR) interstitial brachytherapy in selected patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Methods and Materials: Since March 1, 1993, 60 women with early-stage breast cancer were entered into a protocol of tumor bed irradiation only using an interstitial LDR implant with iodine-125. Patients were eligible if the tumor was ≤3 cm, margins were ≤2 mm, there was no extensive intraductal component, the axilla was surgically staged, and a postoperative mammogram was performed. Implants were placed using a standardized template either at the time of reexcision or shortly after lumpectomy. A total of 50 Gy was delivered at 0.52 Gy/h over a period of 96 h to the lumpectomy bed plus a 2-cm margin. Perioperative complications, cosmetic outcome, and local control were assessed. Results: The median follow-up for all patients is 20 months. Three patients experienced minimal perioperative pain that required temporary nonnarcotic analgesics. There have been four postoperative infections which resolved with oral antibiotics. No significant skin reactions related to the implant were noted and no patient experienced impaired would healing. Early cosmetic results reveal minimal changes consisting of transient hyperpigmentation of the skin at the puncture sites and temporary induration in the tumor bed. Good to excellent cosmetic results were noted in all 19 patients followed up a minimum of 24 months posttherapy. To date, 51 women have obtained 6-12- month follow-up mammograms and no recurrences have been noted. All patients currently have no physical signs of recurrence, and no patient has failed regionally or distantly. Conclusion: Treatment of the tumor bed alone with LDR interstitial brachytherapy appears to he well tolerated, and early results are promising. Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary to establish the equivalence of this treatment approach compared to standard BCT, however."

A., et al.",1997,The role of regional nodal irradiation in the management of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the incidence of regional nodal failure (RNF) and indications for regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with Stage I and II breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Methods and Materials: Four hundred fifty-six patients with Stage I/II breast cancer were treated with BCT at William Beaumont Hospital. All patients underwent excisional biopsy and 288 (63%) were reexcised. A Level I/II ipsilateral axillary lymph node dissection was performed on 431 patients (95%). Pathologically involved nodes were found in 106 (23%) cases (69 with one to three nodes and 37 with ≤ four nodes involved). All patients received whole breast irradiation (median dose 50 Gy) and 415 (91%) were boosted to the tumor bed (median total dose 60.4 Gy). Three hundred and sixty (79%) patients received breast alone irradiation and 96 (21%) also received RNI. The median axilla/supraclavicular fossa dose was 50 Gy. Results: With a median follow- up of 83 months 15 patients developed a RNF for a 5- and 8-year actuarial rate of 3 and 4%, respectively. The 5- and 8-year actuarial rates of axillary failure (AF) were 0.7 and 1.0%, respectively. The incidence of RNF or AF was not affected by the use of RNI in N0 or N1 patients with one to three positive nodes. Only in patients with four or more positive nodes was there a trend towards improved regional control with RNI (p = 0.09). However, patient numbers were extremely small, and this improvement was limited to a reduction in the rate of failure in the supraclavicular fossa (SCF) (20 vs. 0%, p = 0.04). Multiple clinical, pathologic, and treatment related factors were analyzed for an association with AF. On univariate analysis, AF was associated with the number of lymph nodes excised (p < 0.0001) estrogen receptor status (p = 0.0016), and pathologic node status (p = 0.0021). Conclusions: Regional nodal failure as the first site of failure is uncommon in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with BCT with ≤ three positive lymph nodes and appears unaffected by RNI. For patients with four or more positive lymph nodes, a trend towards improved RNF was noted with RNI, primarily in the SCF. However, patient numbers were extremely small in all subsets analyzed. Additional studies are needed to further define the need for RNI in these Patients and help determine other factors associated with RNF."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",1997,Long-term outcome with interstitial brachytherapy in the management of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We reviewed our institution's experience with interstitial implant boosts to determine their long-term impact on local control and cosmetic results. Methods and Materials: Between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1987, 390 women with 400 cases of Stage I and II breast cancer were managed with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) at William Beaumont Hospital. All patients were treated with an excisional biopsy and 253 (63%) underwent reexcision. Radiation consisted of 45-50 Gy external beam irradiation to the whole breast followed by a boost to the tumor bed to at least 60 Gy using either electrons [108], photons [15], or an interstitial implant [277] with either 192Ir [190] or 125I [87]. Long-term local control and cosmetic outcome were assessed and contrasted between patients boosted with either interstitial implants, electrons, or photons. Results: With a median follow- up of 81 months, 25 patients have recurred in the treated breast for a 5- and 8-year actuarial rate of local recurrence of 4 and 8%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the 5- or 8-year actuarial rates of local recurrence using either electrons, photons, or an interstitial implant. Greater than 90% of patients obtained a good or excellent cosmetic result, and no statistically significant differences in cosmetic outcome were seen whether electrons, photons, or implants were used. Conclusions: We conclude that patients with Stage I and II breast cancer undergoing BCT and judged to be candidates for boosts can be effectively managed with LDR interstitial brachytherapy. Long-term local control and cosmetic outcome are excellent and similar to patients boosted with either electrons or photons."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",1998,Implementation of 3D-virtual brachytherapy in the management of breast cancer: A description of a new method of interstitial brachytherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present the initial description of a new technique of interstitial breast brachytherapy in which a computer-generated image of an implant template is applied virtually to serial-computed tomography (CT) scan images of a patient's breast. Optimal placement of the virtual template around the CT images of the proposed target volume provides the physician with a preplan for improved positioning of implant needles around the actual target volume intraoperatively. Methods and Materials: Since March of 1993, 110 patients with early-stage breast cancer were entered onto a protocol of low or high dose rate brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality for part of their breast-conserving therapy. To improve the accuracy and reproducibility of target volume coverage in patients with a closed lumpectomy cavity, 11 of these implants were performed using the virtual brachytherapy technique. The virtual implant procedure was performed by first placing radiopaque skin markers on the breast surface for reference on the CT image and ultimately as intraoperative landmarks for the placement of implant needles. A CT scan of the breast was then performed and the target volume outlined on each CT scan slice by the physician. A virtual image of the brachytherapy template was then positioned around the CT image of the target volume to achieve an idealized implant with optimal coverage. The projected entrance and exit points of all needles on the skin of the breast (from the idealized virtual implant) were then identified (by perspective rendering of multiple 3D views) and hard-copy images taken to the operating room. The implant was then constructed by referencing the virtual implant images (needle entrance and exit points) to the radiopaque skin markers on the breast. After the implant was completed, a CT scan of the breast with the template catheters or needles in position was taken for comparison of the actual target volume coverage with the virtual implant generated preoperatively. Results: Intraoperative ultrasound was used to check the real-time position of the afterloading needles in reference to chest wall and posterior border of the target volume. No adjustment of needles was required in any of the 11 patients. Assessment of target volume coverage between the virtual implant and the actual CT image of the implant showed excellent agreement. In each case, all target volume boundaries specified by the physician were adequately covered. The total number of implant planes, intertemplate separation, and template orientation were identical between the virtual and real implant. Conclusion: We conclude that 3D virtual brachytherapy may offer an improved technique for accurately performing interstitial implants of the breast with a closed lumpectomy cavity in selected patients. Although preliminary results show excellent coverage of the desired target volume, additional patients will be required to establish the reproducibility of this technique and its practical limitations."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2012,Factors associated with optimal long-term cosmetic results in patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation using balloon-based brachytherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To evaluate factors associated with optimal cosmetic results at 72 months for early-stage breast cancer patients treated with Mammosite balloon-based accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Materials: A total of 1,440 patients (1,449 cases) with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving therapy were treated with balloon-based brachytherapy to deliver APBI (34 Gy in 3.4-Gy fractions). Cosmetic outcome was evaluated at each follow-up visit and dichotomized as excellent/good (E/G) or fair/poor (F/P). Follow-up was evaluated at 36 and 72 months to establish long-term cosmesis, stability of cosmesis, and factors associated with optimal results. Results: The percentage of evaluable patients with excellent/good (E/G) cosmetic results at 36 months and more than 72 months were 93.3% (n = 708/759) and 90.4% (n = 235/260). Factors associated with optimal cosmetic results at 72 months included: larger skin spacing (p = 0.04) and T1 tumors (p = 0.02). Using multiple regression analysis, the only factors predictive of worse cosmetic outcome at 72 months were smaller skin spacing (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.99) and tumors greater than 2 cm (OR, 4.96, CI, 1.53-16.07). In all, 227 patients had both a 36-month and a 72-month cosmetic evaluation. The number of patients with E/G cosmetic results decreased only slightly from 93.4% at 3 years to 90.8% (p = 0.13) at 6 years, respectively. Conclusions: APBI delivered with balloon-based brachytherapy produced E/G cosmetic results in 90.4% of cases at 6 years. Larger tumors (T2) and smaller skin spacing were found to be the two most important independent predictors of cosmesis.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",1999,Dose-volume analysis for quality assurance of interstitial brachytherapy for breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective: The use of brachytherapy in the management of breast cancer has increased significantly over the past several years. Unfortunately, few techniques have been developed to compare dosimetric quality and target volume coverage concurrently. We present a new method of implant evaluation that incorporates computed tomography-based three-dimensional (3D) dose-volume analysis with traditional measures of brachytherapy quality. Analyses performed in this fashion will be needed to ultimately assist in determining the efficacy of breast implants.Methods and Materials: Since March of 1993, brachytherapy has been used as the sole radiation modality after lumpectomy in selected protocol patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Eight patients treated with high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy who had surgical clips outlining the lumpectomy cavity and underwent computed tomography (CT) scanning after implant placement were selected for this study. For each patient, the postimplant CT dataset was transferred to a 3D treatment planning system. The lumpectomy cavity, target volume (lumpectomy cavity plus a 1-cm margin), and entire breast were outlined on each axial slice. Once all volumes were entered, the programmed HDR brachytherapy source positions and dwell times were imported into the 3D planning system. Using the tools provided by the 3D planning system, the implant dataset was then registered to the visible implant template in the CT dataset. The distribution of the implant dose was analyzed with respect to defined volumes via dose-volume histograms (DVH). Isodose surfaces, the dose homogeneity index, and dosimetric coverage of the defined volumes were calculated and contrasted. All patients received 32 Gy to the entire implanted volume in 8 fractions of 4 Gy over 4 days.Results: Three-plane implants were used for 7 patients and a two-plane implant for 1 patient. The median number of needles per implant was 16.5 (range 11-18). Despite visual verification by the treating physician that surgical clips (with an appropriate margin) were within the boundaries of the implant needles, the median proportion of the lumpectomy cavity that received the prescribed dose was only 87% (range 73-98%). With respect to the target volume, a median of only 68% (range 56-81%) of this volume received 100% of the prescribed dose. On average, the minimum dose received by at least 90% of the target volume was 22 Gy (range 17.3-26.9), which corresponds to 69% of the prescribed dose.Conclusion: Preliminary results using our new technique to evaluate implant quality with CT-based 3D dose-volume analysis appear promising. Dosimetric quality and target volume coverage can be concurrently analyzed, allowing the possibility of evaluating implants prospectively. Considering that target volume coverage may be suboptimal even after radiographically verifying accurate implant placement, techniques similar to this need to be developed to ultimately determine the true efficacy of brachytherapy in the management of breast cancer.

"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2004,Defining the clinical target volume for patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and accelerated partial breast irradiation: A pathologic analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Background This pathologic analysis was conducted to help define the clinical target volume (CTV) for partial breast irradiation (PBI) by analyzing the amount and distance of residual disease found at reexcision after an initial lumpectomy. Materials and methods The study population consisted of 441 patients derived from a dataset of 607 consecutive cases of Stage I and II breast cancer (reviewed by one pathologist) who underwent reexcision (after lumpectomy) before radiation therapy (RT) as part of their standard breast-conserving therapy (BCT). The assumption in this analysis was that the maximal measured extension distance from the initial excision specimen margin (in the reexcision specimen) represents the minimum distance that needs to receive full-dose RT for PBI to be successful. In 333 of the 441 cases, it was possible to measure this distance. Margins were classified as negative (carcinoma >:12 low-power field [LPF] from the margin), near (<12 LPF from the margin), or positive. The amount of carcinoma near the final margin was quantified as the width of invasive carcinoma and number of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) ducts near the margin and divided into three groups: least, intermediate, and greatest amount. Results Of the 333 cases, 119 (35.7%) had no residual carcinoma in the reexcision specimen, 67 (20.1%) had maximum extension (invasive carcinoma or DCIS) distances of >0<5 mm beyond the initial excision cavity edge, 83 (24.9%) extended 5 to <10 mm, 34 (10.2%) extended 10 to <15 mm, and 30 (9.0%) extended ≥15 mm. In 90% of 134 patients with negative initial lumpectomy margins (per National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project criteria) at lumpectomy, if any residual disease was present (38.2% of cases), it was limited to <10 mm from the edge of the original lumpectomy margin. The initial lumpectomy margin status was then combined with the invasive carcinoma: specimen maximum dimension ratio to determine if these two criteria (when combined) could better identify patients with residual disease limited to <10 mm from the initial margin. Analyzed in this fashion, all 13 of the reexcision specimens (9.7%) with >:10 mm of maximum extension by carcinoma beyond the edge of the initial excision specimen cavity could be identified. Conclusions A margin of 10 mm around the tumor bed should be adequate in covering disease remaining in the breast after lumpectomy in >90% of patients treated with PBI. However, it is possible to accurately identify all patients with disease extending beyond 10 mm using more restrictive pathologic selection criteria. These results can also be used as a guide for defining the CTV for boost treatment after whole-breast RT and the amount of breast tissue to remove at reexcision.  Inc."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2003,Ongoing clinical experience utilizing 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy to deliver partial-breast irradiation in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: We present our ongoing clinical experience utilizing 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) to deliver partial-breast irradiation (PBI) in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients referred for postoperative radiation therapy after lumpectomy were treated with PBI using our previously reported 3D-CRT technique. Ninety-four percent of patients had surgical clips outlining the lumpectomy cavity (mean: 6 clips). The clinical target volume (CTV) consisted of the lumpectomy cavity plus a 10-mm margin in 9 patients and 15-mm margin in 22 (median: 15 mm). The planning target volume consisted of the CTV plus a 10-mm margin for breathing motion and treatment setup uncertainties. The prescribed dose (PD) was 34 or 38.5 Gy (6 patients and 25 patients, respectively) in 10 fractions b.i.d. separated by 6 h and delivered in 5 consecutive days. Patients were treated in the supine position with 3-5 beams (mean: 4) designed to irradiate the CTV with <10% inhomogeneity and a comparable or lower dose to the heart, lung, and contralateral breast compared with standard whole-breast tangents. The median follow-up duration is 10 months (range: 1-30 months). Four patients have been followed >2 years, 6 >1.5 years, and 5 >1 year. The remaining 16 patients have been followed <12 months. Results: No skin changes greater than Grade 1 erythema were noted during treatment. At the initial 4-8-week follow-up visit, 19 patients (61%) experienced Grade 1 toxicity and 3 patients (10%) Grade 2 toxicity. No Grade 3 toxicities were observed. The remaining 9 patients (29%) had no observable radiation effects. Cosmetic results were rated as good/excellent in all evaluable patients at 6 months (n = 3), 12 months (n = 5), 18 months (n = 6), and in the 4 evaluable patients at >2 years after treatment. The mean coverage of the CTV by the 100% isodose line (IDL) was 98% (range: 54-100%, median: 100%) and by the 95% IDL, 100% (range: 99-100%). The mean coverage of the planning target volume by the 95% IDL was 100% (range: 97-100%). The mean percentage of the breast receiving 100% of the PD was 23% (range: 14-39%). The mean percentage of the breast receiving 50% of the PD was 47% (range: 34-60%). Conclusions: Utilizing 3D-CRT to deliver PBI is technically feasible, and acute toxicity to date has been minimal. Additional follow-up will be needed to assess the long-term effects of these larger fraction sizes on normal-tissue sequelae and the impact of this fractionation schedule on treatment efficacy.

"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2011,The impact of lymph node status on clinical outcomes following accelerated partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare clinical outcomes following accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) between node-negative and node-positive early stage breast cancer patients. Materials/Methods: Five hundred ten patients with early stage breast cancer received accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as part of their breast conservation therapy between April 1993 and November, 2010. Of these, 39 were lymph node positive with 10 patients having N1mi disease (median size of mets = 0.82 mm) and 29 patients having N1 disease (61.5% had one node positive [median size of mets = 2.5 mm], 30.8% had 2 nodes positive [median size of mets = 8.0 mm], and 7.7% had 3 nodes positive [median size of mets = 20 mm]). Patient, clinical, and pathologic factors were analyzed and compared for the node-negative and node-positive cohorts including age, tumor size, receptor status, margin status, adjuvant hormonal therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and length of follow-up. Clinical outcomes were analyzed including local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), axillary recurrence (AR), regional-nodal recurrence (RR), distant metastases (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Node-positive patients were younger (p = 0.04), had larger tumors (p<0.001), and were more likely to receive chemotherapy (p<0.001). Median follow up was 5.3 years for node-negative patients and 5.9 years for node-positive patients (p = 0.06). At 5 years, no differences were seen in the 5-year actuarial rates of LR (2.2% v. 2.6%, p = 0.86), AR (0% v. 0%, p = 0.69), DFS (90.0% v. 88.0%, p = 0.79), CSS (98.0% v. 90.0%, p = 0.06), or OS (91.0 v. 84.0%, p = 0.65) while higher rates of RR (0% v. 6.1%, p<0.001) and DM (2.2% v. 8.9%, p = 0.005) were noted in node-positive patients. A total of 10 LRs occurred in the nodenegative patients and 1 LR in the node-positive patients at a median of 2.6 and 1.5 years respectively. Both RR that developed in node-positive patients were within the supraclavicular fossa at a median of 2.8 years. Univariate analysis of LR was performed and age (p = 0.31), tumor size (p = 0.48), ER status (p = 0.13), PR status (p = 0.34), T-stage (p = 0.48), chemotherapy (p = 0.41), APBI technique (p = 0.80), and nodal status (p = 0.86) were not associated with LR while there was a trend for the association of LR with close/positive margins (p = 0.07), and failure to receive adjuvant hormonal therapy (p = 0.06). No variables were associated with any type of AR. Conclusions: No difference was seen in the rates of local recurrence or axillary failure between node-negative and node-positive following APBI with 5-years of follow-up."
"Vicini, F. A., et al.",2002,Optimizing breast cancer treatment efficacy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To present our clinical experience using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to improve dose uniformity and treatment efficacy in patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Methods and Materials: A total of 281 patients with Stage 0, I, and II breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy received whole breast RT after lumpectomy using our static, multileaf collimator (sMLC) IMRT technique. The technical and practical aspects of implementing this technique on a large scale in the clinic were analyzed. The clinical outcome of patients treated with this technique was also reviewed. Results: The median time required for three-dimensional alignment of the tangential fields and dosimetric IMRT planning was 40 and 45 min, respectively. The median number of sMLC segments required per patient to meet the predefined dose-volume constraints was 6 (range 3-12). The median percentage of the treatment given with open fields (no sMLC segments) was 83% (range 38-96%), and the median treatment time was <10 min. The median volume of breast receiving 105% of the prescribed dose was 11% (range 0-67.6%). The median breast volume receiving 110% of the prescribed dose was 0% (range 0-39%), and the median breast volume receiving 115% of the prescribed dose was also 0%. A total of 157 patients (56%) experienced Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 0 or I acute skin toxicity; 102 patients (43%) developed Grade II acute skin toxicity and only 3 (1%) experienced Grade III toxicity. The cosmetic results at 12 months (95 patients analyzable) were rated as excellent/good in 94 patients (99%). No skin telengiectasias, significant fibrosis, or persistent breast pain was noted. Conclusion: The use of intensity modulation with our sMLC technique for tangential whole breast RT is an efficient method for achieving a uniform and standardized dose throughout the whole breast. Strict dose-volume constraints can be readily achieved resulting in both uniform coverage of breast tissue and a potential reduction in acute and chronic toxicities. Because the median number of sMLC segments required per patient is only 6, the treatment time is equivalent to conventional wedged-tangent treatment techniques. As a result, widespread implementation of this technology can be achieved with minimal imposition on clinic resources and time constraints.  Science Inc."
"Vujovic, O., et al.",2015,Time interval from breast-conserving surgery to breast irradiation in early stage node-negative breast cancer: 17-year follow-up Results and patterns of recurrence.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: A retrospectivechart review was conducted to determine whether the time interval from breast-conserving surgery to breast irradiation (surgery-radiation therapy interval) in early stage node-negative breast cancer had any detrimental effects on recurrence rates. Methods and Materials: There were 566 patients with T1 to T3, N0 breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and breast irradiation and without adjuvant systemic treatment between 1985 and 1992. The surgery-to-radiation therapy intervals used for analysis were 0 to 8 weeks (201 patients), >8 to 12 weeks (233 patients), >12 to 16 weeks (91 patients), and > 16 weeks (41 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to local recurrence, disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were calculated. Results: Median follow-up was 17.4 years. Patients in all 4 time intervals were similar in terms of characteristics and pathologic features. There were no statistically significant differences among the 4 time groups in local recurrence (P =.67) or disease-free survival (P =.82). The local recurrence rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 4.9%, 11.5%, and 15.0%, respectively. The distant disease relapse rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 10.6%, 15.4%, and 18.5%, respectively. The disease-free failure rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 20%, 32.3%, and 39.8%, respectively. Cause-specific survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 92%, 84.6%, and 79.8%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 5,10, and 15 years were 89.3%, 79.2%, and 66.9%, respectively. Conclusions: Surgery-radiation therapy intervals up to 16 weeks from breast-conserving surgery are not associated with any increased risk of recurrence in early stage nodenegative breast cancer. There is a steady local recurrence rate of 1 % per year with adjuvant radiation alone."
"Vujovic, O., et al.",2009,Effect of Interval to Definitive Breast Surgery on Clinical Presentation and Survival in Early-Stage Invasive Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To examine the effect of clinical presentation and interval to breast surgery on local recurrence and survival in early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: The data from 397 patients with Stage T1-T2N0 breast carcinoma treated with conservative surgery and breast radiotherapy between 1985 and 1992 were reviewed at the London Regional Cancer Program. The clinical presentation consisted of a mammogram finding or a palpable lump. The intervals from clinical presentation to definitive breast surgery used for analysis were 0-4, >4-12, and >12 weeks. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival were determined for the three groups. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of clinical presentation and interval to definitive surgery on survival. Results: The median follow-up was 11.2 years. No statistically significant difference was found in local recurrence as a function of the interval to definitive surgery (p = .424). A significant difference was noted in disease-free survival (p = .040) and cause-specific survival (p = .006) with an interval of >12 weeks to definitive breast surgery. However, the interval to definitive surgery was dependent on the presentation for cause-specific survival, with a substantial effect for patients with a mammographic presentation and a negligible effect for patients with a lump presentation (interaction p = .041). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that an interval of >12 weeks to breast surgery might be associated with decreased survival for patients with a mammographic presentation, but it appeared to have no effect on survival for patients presenting with a palpable breast lump.

"Vujovic, O., et al.",2013,The time interval from conservative breast surgery to breast irradiation in early-stage node-negative breast cancer: 17-year follow-up results and patterns of recurrence.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): A retrospective review was conducted to determine if the time interval from conservative breast surgery to breast irradiation in early stage node negative breast cancer had any detrimental effect on local-recurrence rates (LRR) or disease-free survival (DFS). Materials/Methods: There were 567 patients with T1-T2, NO breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and breast irradiation and without adjuvant systemic treatment between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1992. The time intervals from definitive breast surgery to breast irradiation used for analysis were: 0-8 weeks (201 patients), >8-12 weeks (234 patients), >12-16 weeks (91 patients), and >16 weeks (41 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to local-recurrence, disease-free survival, distant-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were calculated. Results: Median follow-up was 17.4 years. Patients in all 4 time intervals were similar in terms of patient characteristics and pathologic features. There was no statistically significant difference between the 4 time groups in local-recurrence (p=0.85) or disease-free survival (p=0.45). The LRR at 5, 10, and 15 years was 4.9%, 11.5%, and 15.0%, respectively, resulting in a LRR of 1% per year. The distant-disease relapse rate (DDR) at 5, 10, and 15 years was 10.6%, 15.4%, and 18.5%, respectively. The disease-free failure rate (DFF) at 5, 10, and 15 years was 20.0%, 32.3%, and 39.8%, respectively. Cause-specific survival (CSS) at 5, 10, and 15 years was 92%, 84.6%, and 79.8%, respectively. The overall survival (OS) at 5, 10, and 15 years was 89.3%, 79.2%, and 66.9%. Conclusions: This retrospective review suggests that time intervals up to 16 weeks from definitive breast surgery to the start of breast irradiation are not associated with an increased risk of recurrence in early stage node negative breast cancer. There is also a steady increase in local recurrence at a rate of 1% per year indicating a long natural history and lack of cure for early stage breast carcinoma. (Table Presented)."
"Wadasaki, K. and I. Nishibuchi",2015,Relationship between sentinel lymph nodes and postoperative tangential fields in early breast cancer evaluated by using SPECT/CT.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Post-operative radiation therapy after partial mastectomy contributes modestly to controlling occult axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with early breast cancer. This efficacy of radiation depends on the positional relationship of the occult lymph node metastasis and the radiation fields. We evaluated the relationship between postoperative tangential fields and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that are often the first and only sites of breast cancer metastases by using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) images. Materials/Methods: Subjects included 72 patients with early breast cancer who underwent SPECT/CT of the SLNs and received whole-breast irradiation with tangential fields after partial mastectomy. We evaluated the SLN locations in detail by using SPECT/CT images. In cases in which more than one SLN was detected, the SLN with the strongest radioisotope accumulation was evaluated. The SLN locations were entered into the treatment planning CT image, with a 5-mm-diameter sphere. A 15-mmdiameter sphere including the 5-mm treatment margin around the SLNs was defined as PTV-SLN. The relationships between the SLNs and the tangential fields were examined on digitally reconstructed radiography (DRR) images. The PTV-SLN doses with tangential irradiation were evaluated and expressed as the percentage of the prescribed dose. An analysis of the association of several factors with SLN doses from tangential fields was also performed. Results: In 69 patients, SLNs were detected by using SPECT/CT; 68 SLNs were located at axillary lymph node level I (superficial, 18; middle, 40; deep, 10) and one was located at level II. A total of 62 SLNs (90%) were determined to be located inside the tangential fields on the DRR images. The median doses of SLN center, mean PTVSLN dose, and PTV-SLN D95 (the minimum dose delivered to 95% of the volume) were 94.1% (range, 15.3-101.9%), 93.7% (range, 29.3-104.0%) and 84.8% (range, 6.8-99.8%). The PTV-SLN D95 was <90% in 59% of cases. The doses of the SLNs that were located in the deep portion of axillary level I were significantly lower than those in the other portions. Conclusion: The SLNs were located inside the tangential field in >90% cases but the D95 for the SLNs with treatment margins were <90% of the prescribed doses in more than half of the cases. Modification of the individual treatment fields seemed to be necessary to ensure coverage of the SLNs in whole-breast irradiation."
"Wallace, A. S., et al.",2016,Adherence to the choosing wisely campaign recommendations for radiation treatment duration in breast cancer: Analysis of medicare data at 12 centers in the southeastern United States.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends avoidance of whole breast radiation as part of breast conservation therapy in women > 50 years of age with early stage invasive breast cancer without considering shorter treatment intervals. The purpose of this project is to analyze duration of radiation treatment (RT) in a cohort of Medicare patients in 5 states in the southeastern United States. Materials/Methods: Data were for Medicare patients > 65 years of age with breast cancer diagnosis from 12 cancer community networks affiliated with an academic center in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida. Eligible patients with AJCC 7 stage 0-II breast cancer who were treated with lumpectomy and subsequent RT from Quarter 1, 2012 to Quarter 1, 2015 were identified using ICD-9 and CPT/HCPCS codes. Adherence was measured by RT treatment duration of short course (SC): <Z4 calendar weeks versus long course (LC): >4 calendar weeks. Results: A total of 1,194 patients treated with lumpectomy were identified, 726 (60.8%) of which were treated with radiation therapy. Median age at diagnosis was 71.1 (7.9 IQR); 631 (86.9%) patients were white. The majority of patients was stage I (58.4%); 18.4% and 23.1% were Stage 0 and II, respectively. Median time from lumpectomy to start of radiation was 91.5 days (IQR 48.0 days). Chemotherapy was administered in 14.4% and 21.9% treated with SC vs LC RT respectively. Average adherence to SC at all sites was 36.4%. Average adherence by upper, middle, and lower tertile of sites was 45.9%, 30.4%, and 13% respectively. Sites in the top tertile of guideline adherence were more likely to have larger patient volumes. A trend toward increased guideline adherence per year was observed: 32.8% (2012), 35.3% (2013), and 39.7% (2014). Conclusion: Trends demonstrate increased adherence to guidelines with progression of time, but continued variability among sites. These trends should continue to increase as long-term data from hypofractionation literature matures. Future studies would benefit from analysis of site, physician, and patient characteristics that likely influence duration of treatment.

"Wallace, M., et al.",2010,Phase I/II Study Evaluating Early Tolerance in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Treated With the MammoSite Balloon Breast Brachytherapy Catheter Using a 2-Day Dose Schedule.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Initial Phase I/II results using balloon brachytherapy to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in 2 days in patients with early-stage breast cancer are presented. Materials and Methods: Between March 2004 and August 2007, 45 patients received adjuvant radiation therapy after lumpectomy with balloon brachytherapy in a Phase I/II trial delivering 2800 cGy in four fractions of 700 cGy. Toxicities were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 scale and cosmesis was documented at ≥6 months. Results: The median age was 66 years (range, 48-83) and median skin spacing was 12 mm (range, 8-24). The median follow-up was 11.4 months (5.4-48 months) with 21 patients (47%) followed ≥1 year, 11 (24%) ≥2 years, and 7 (16%) ≥3 years. At <6 months (n = 45), Grade II toxicity rates were 9% radiation dermatitis, 13% breast pain, 2% edema, and 2% hyperpigmentation. Grade III breast pain was reported in 13% (n = 6). At ≥6 months (n = 43), Grade II toxicity rates were: 2% radiation dermatitis, 2% induration, and 2% hypopigmentation. Grade III breast pain was reported in 2%. Infection was 13% (n = 6) at <6 months and 5% (n = 2) at ≥6 months. Persistent seroma ≥6 months was 30% (n = 13). Fat necrosis developed in 4 cases (2 symptomatic). Rib fractures were seen in 4% (n = 2). Cosmesis was good/excellent in 96% of cases. Conclusions: Treatment with balloon brachytherapy using a 2-day dose schedule resulted acceptable rates of Grade II/III chronic toxicity rates and similar cosmetic results observed with a standard 5-day accelerated partial breast irradiation schedule.

"Wallace, M., et al.",2011,"Comparison of five year clinical outcomes between interstitial, Balloon-based, and 3-D conformal partial breast irradiation techniques in astro suitable and cautionary risk category patients.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To compare clinical outcomes between interstitial, balloon-based, and 3-D conformal (3-D CRT) partial breast techniques in defined patient risk groups. Materials/Methods: Four hundred thirty-one patients with early-stage breast cancer and DCIS were treated atWilliam Beaumont Hospital between April, 1993 and January, 2011 and were categorized in the suitable or cautionary group patients per the ASTRO consensus guidelines. Patients were stratified by partial breast technique into interstitial, balloon-based, and 3-D CRT. Clinical, pathological, and treatment related characteristics including age, tumor size, receptor status, lymph node status, margins, and adjuvant hormonal treatment, or adjuvant chemotherapy were compared between groups. Clinical outcomes measured included local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastases, disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Follow up was 10.2 years, 2.6 years, and 5.2 years for the interstitial, balloon, and 3-D CRT patients respectively. The three groups were comparable with balloon-based patients more frequently having close margins and more likely to have DCIS histology. Significant differences did exist in the frequency of adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy received. At 5 years, no difference in LR (1.2% v. 2.8% v. 1.1%,p = 0.73), RR (0% for all groups),DM (1.8% vs. 1.6% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.67), DFS (97% vs. 96% vs. 96%, p = 0.62), CSS (99% vs. 97% vs. 98%, p = 0.52), and OS (87% vs. 92% vs. 92%, p = 0.27) were seen between the interstitial, balloon-based, and 3-D CRT patients. Conclusions: With 5 year follow up, no difference in clinical outcomes were noted between interstitial, balloon-based, and 3-D CRT partial breast irradiation techniques in ASTRO suitable and cautionary risk category patients, with excellent local control in all groups. Despite 30% of patients having close margins in the balloon cohort, local control remained excellent as well. (Table Presented)."
"Wallace, M., et al.",2012,Clinical outcomes following accelerated partial breast irradiation stratified by estrogen receptor status.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Revised guidelines for the estrogen receptor (ER) status of breast cancer now classify a tumor as ER negative only if nuclear staining is <1% while a new category of ER weak positive has been introduced by some institutions for staining between 1-9%. Mixed data has been published between the relationship of estrogen receptor (ER) status and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in women undergoing accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). We present our five-year outcomes for ER negative patients stratified by degree of estrogen receptor expression (ERE). Materials/Methods: A total of 346 patients treated with APBI had results for degree of ERE. ER status was assessed based on the amount of positive staining of the tumor cells' nuclear membranes for the ER receptor by immunohistochemistry and stratified into three groups: ER True Negative (ERTN: <1%), ER Weak Positive (ERWP: 1-9%), and ER Positive (ERP: ≥10%). Patient demographics and tumor characteristics were evaluated by ER grouping. Outcomes analyzed include ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional recurrence (RR), distant metastases (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Median age was 63 years (range: 41-93 years) while median tumor size was 11.2 mm (range: 1.0-35.0mm). Median follow-up for all patients was 5.7 years (range: 0.2-18.0 yrs). Statistically significant differences existed for tumors with low ER expression including a propensity to be higher grade (Grade 3: 77% vs. 67% vs. 11%, p < 0.001) and treated with chemotherapy (35% vs. 43% vs. 14%, p < 0.001; ERTN, ERWP, and ERP, respectively). ER weak positive tumors were more likely to be treated with endocrine therapy (32% vs. 15%) vs. ER true negative tumors (p < 0.001) but less likely than true ER positive tumors to receive anti-ER therapy (32% vs. 66%, p < 0.001). Clinical outcomes are presented in the Table by degree of ER expression. No differences in IBTR, DFS, CSS, or OS were noted with a significant difference in RR noted (0% vs. 3.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.008) and a trend for increased distant metastases (5.9% vs. 11.1% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.06) for tumors with lower degrees of ER expression. Conclusions: Decreased degree of ER expression is associated with higher tumor grade and increased distant metastases for early-stage breast cancer. Patients with weak ER expression did not have markedly different outcomes vs. the ER true negative cohort in our patient population."
"Wang, C., et al.",2014,Early stage breast cancer radiation treatment assessment using diffusion weighted mri and dynamic contrast enhanced mri.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To assess the response of early stage breast cancer patients to single-dose preoperative partial breast radiotherapy using functional parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI). Materials/Methods: Thirty-two female patients with biopsy-proven early stage breast cancer were involved in this IRB-approved phase I doseescalation study. Each patient received one of three prescription doses (15 Gy, 18 Gy, and 21 Gy) in a single-fraction using IMRT. Fifteen of 32 patients had paired pre- and post-radiation MRI images acquired sagittally in the prone position on a 1.5T clinical scanner using a standard breast coil. The imaging protocol included T1- and T2-weighted imaging, DCE-MRI and DW-MRI. In the DCE-MRI, the contrast agent (CA) gadopentetate dimeglumine was intravenously injected with a 0.1 mmol/kg bodyweight dose at 2 ml/s flow rate. One pre-enhanced and six post-enhanced series were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D SPGR sequence with a temporal resolution of about 1 minute. Three parameters were analyzed using the two-compartment Tofts kinetic model: volume transfer constant (Ktrans), extravascular-extracellular space (EES) fraction ve, and the model-free initial Area Under CA concentration Curve (iAUC). DW-MRI scans were acquired using a spin-echo EPI sequence with diffusion weighting factors of β = 500 mm2/s and β = 0 mm2/s, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were derived. The average values of the four parameters within CTV and PTV were recorded before and after treatment, and statistical tests were performed to assess the relative changes and determine the significance of differences in parameter changes with different prescription doses. A correlation test was also used to examine the potential linear relationship between the parameter relative changes and the prescription dose. Results: After radiation therapy, iAUC significantly increased in PTV (p < 0.01) and CTV (p < 0.01), and ve significantly increased in PTV (p < 0.05) and CTV (p < 0.05). The relative changes of ADC in CTV (p < 0.01) and PTV (p < 0.01) were also found to be statistically significant. For those patients receiving 21 Gy, the relative changes in CTV and PTV for all parameters exceeded those of patients receiving either 15 Gy or 18 Gy. Correlation tests proved that linear dependence on radiation dose existed in all four PTV parameters' relative changes (Pearson correlation coefficient jrj > 0.8), and in CTV, this linear relationship was also observed in 3 out of 4 relative changes except Ktrans . Conclusions: The initial results of this study suggest a role for the MRI parameters iAUC, ve, and ADC as biomarkers for breast cancer radiation treatment response. Correlation with clinical outcomes in future clinical trials is necessary."
"Wang, C., et al.",2015,Treatment assessment using dynamic fractal signature dissimilarity as a novel biomarker for early-stage breast cancer radiation therapy: A feasibility study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate the feasibility of using a novel dynamic fractal signature dissimilarity (FSD) analysis to assess early-stage breast cancer single-dose radiation therapy response with paired pre and posttreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Materials/Methods: A novel texture analysis method of dynamic FSD based on MR image intensity is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the heterogeneity of contrast agent (CA) uptake during a DCE-MRI examination. To demonstrate its feasibility, a retrospective study was conducted with 15 female patients who had biopsy proven early-stage breast cancer and received a single-fraction radiation treatment preoperatively. Each patient had paired pretreatment and post-treatment DCE-MRI scans. During each scan, one pre-enhanced volume (V0) and six post-enhanced volumes (V1-6) were acquired at a temporal resolution of approximately 1 minute. To generate a dynamic FSD curve, the 3D CTV was selected as the region of interest. At a certain time point, i, after the CA injection, the FSD value was calculated by comparing the MR image intensity of CTVi with the corresponding one acquired at the preceding time point CTVi-1 using the 3D blanket method. For both pre and post-treatment scans, two heuristic features of the dynamic FSD curve, initial enhancement (IE) and area under curve (AUC), were recorded and evaluated. The relative changes (post-treatment value/pretreatment value) of IE and AUC were compared with the relative change of the mean permeability rate constant (Ktrans) derived from the standard pharmacokinetic (PK) Tofts model. The calculation times of the dynamic FSD analysis and the PK analysis were recorded for efficiency evaluation. Correlation tests were conducted to examine the potential relationship between the relative change of heuristic features and the relative change of CTV Ktrans. Results: All dynamic FSD curves demonstrated similar features with a rapid wash-in peak and a wash-out phase with varying tail length. After the radiation treatment, the changes of dynamic FSD curve's amplitude and shape were noticeable. The relative changes of dynamic FSD curve's AUC (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.85, P <.01) and IE (r > 0.92, P < .01) were linearly correlated with the relative change of CTV's mean Ktransvalue. Compared with voxel-by-voxel PK analysis, the dynamic FSD analysis had a higher computation efficiency by a factor of 20 without the need of T1 calibration and PK model fitting. Conclusion: The initial results of this study suggest that the proposed dynamic FSD analysis might serve as a convenient and reliable alternative to the computationally intensive PK model fitting process to assess treatment response of radiation therapy."
"Wang, C., et al.",2016,Early-stage breast radiation therapy assessment using transcytolemmal water exchange analysis of dce-magnetic resonance imaging: Initial results.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): To investigate the use of transcytolemmal water exchange analysis in the treatment assessment of early stage breast cancer single-dose preoperative radiotherapy with paired dynamic contrastenhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Materials/Methods: 15 female patients with biopsy-proven early stage breast cancer received one of three prescription doses (15Gy, 18Gy, or 21Gy) in a single-fraction using IMRT. Each patient had paired pre- and post-treatment DCE-MRI scans acquired sagittally in the prone position. Gd-DTPA2 contrast agent (CA) was administered at a dose of 0.1mmol/kg bodyweight and 2ml/s flow rate after the calibration scans. One preenhanced volume and six post-enhanced volumes were acquired, and the temporal resolution was approximately 1 minute. For quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis, the intracellular and the extracellular-extravascular water molecules were modelled separately with different longitudinal relaxation rates due to the potentially inhomogeneous CA distribution in extracellular-extravascular space (EES). The mean residence time of intracellular water molecules si, which is the inverse of the transcytolemmal water exchange rate describing the limited water molecule movement from intracellular space to EES, was modeled as a novel physiological biomarker. The Bloch equations were corrected with the presence of si, and the calculation of microvessel permeability rate Ktrans in the classic Tofts model was modified as a nonlinear least-squares problem of integral equation. For each scan, both Ktrans and si were calculated voxel-by-voxel in CTV, and the CTV mean values were reported as primary biomarkers. A biological subvolume (BSV) was identified based on si distribution in CTV using a histogram-based automatic thresholding method. The volume ratio of BSV to CTV was calculated, and Ktrans and si mean values in BSV were also recorded. Signed-rank tests were performed to assess the differences of the recorded parameters before and after radiotherapy. Rank-sum tests were conducted to find parameters that may reflect response difference between different dose groups. Results: After radiotherapy, both CTV mean Ktrans (p < .007) and si (p < .002) significantly decreased. The volume ratio of BSV to CTV showed a decrease after radiotherapy (p < .003), and the decrease of BSV mean Ktrans were also found to be statistically significant (p < .001). For the patients in the 21Gy dose group, the relative BSV Ktrans values (post-RT value/pre-RT value) were significantly smaller (p < .045) than the values of the patients who received less than 21 Gy treatment dose. Conclusion: The initial results suggest that physiological biomarkers from transcytolemmal water exchange analysis significantly changed after radiotherapy. Changes in these biomarkers within the identified biological subvolume may have a role in predicting the clinical impact of radiation dose."
"Wang, E. H., et al.",2014,Adoption of hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer: A national cancer data base analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To evaluate the relationship of patient, hospital, and cancer characteristics with the adoption of hypofractionation in a national sample of patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials We performed a retrospective study of breast cancer patients in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004-2011 who were treated with radiation therapy and met eligibility criteria for hypofractionation. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of hypofractionation (vs conventional fractionation). Results We identified 13,271 women (11.7%) and 99,996 women (88.3%) with early-stage breast cancer who were treated with hypofractionation and conventional fractionation, respectively. The use of hypofractionation increased significantly, with 5.4% of patients receiving it in 2004 compared with 22.8% in 2011 (P<.001 for trend). Patients living ≥50 miles from the cancer reporting facility had increased odds of receiving hypofractionation (odds ratio 1.57 [95% confidence interval 1.44-1.72], P<.001). Adoption of hypofractionation was associated with treatment at an academic center (P<.001) and living in an area with high median income (P<.001). Hypofractionation was less likely to be used in patients with high-risk disease, such as increased tumor size (P<.001) or poorly differentiated histologic grade (P<.001). Conclusions The use of hypofractionation is rising and is associated with increased travel distance and treatment at an academic center. Further adoption of hypofractionation may be tempered by both clinical and nonclinical concerns."
"Wang, E. H., et al.",2015,Adoption of Intensity modulated radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer from 2004 through 2011.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a newer method of radiation therapy (RT) that has been increasingly adopted as an adjuvant treatment after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). IMRT may result in improved cosmesis compared to standard RT, although at greater expense. To investigate the adoption of IMRT, we examined trends and factors associated with IMRT in women under the age of 65 with early stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective study of early stage breast cancer patients treated with BCS followed by whole-breast irradiation (WBI) who were <65 years old in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2011. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of IMRT (vs standard RT). Results: We identified 11,089 women with early breast cancer (9.6%) who were treated with IMRT and 104,448 (90.4%) who were treated with standard RT, after BCS. The proportion of WBI patients receiving IMRT increased yearly from 2004 to 2009, with 5.3% of WBI patients receiving IMRT in 2004 and 11.6% receiving IMRT in 2009. Further use of IMRT declined afterward, with the proportion remaining steady at 11.0% and 10.7% in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Patients treated in nonacademic community centers were more likely to receive IMRT (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.43 for nonacademic vs academic center). Compared to privately insured patients, the uninsured patients (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95) and those with Medicaid insurance (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95) were less likely to receive IMRT. Conclusions: The use of IMRT rose from 2004 to 2009 and then stabilized. Important nonclinical factors associated with IMRT use included facility type and insurance status."
"Wang, J. and J. Ma",2015,The use of 3-D ultrasound imaging system in hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer after breast conservation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We evaluated if a commercially available 3D ultrasound (3D US) simulation system could contribute to CT in contouring the seroma target and improving interobserver consistency for early-stage breast cancer (EBC) patients that underwent breast conservation therapy (BCT). We assessed if 3D US imaging guidance system could replace cone-beam CT (CBCT) guidance system considering the improvement of the accuracy of irradiation and reduction of medical radiation exposure. Materials/Methods: A total of 10 EBC patients with T1-2N0M0 underwent BCT were analyzed from June 2013 to March 2014. The patients underwent hypofractionated breast radiation therapy without regional lymph node irradiation following lumpectomy. Patients were treated to the whole breast with doses of 41.6 to 43.2 Gy in fraction sizes of 2.6 to 2.7 Gy. The tumor bed was simultaneously boosted with doses of 51.2 Gy in fraction sizes of 3.2 Gy. CT simulation was performed in each subject, meanwhile, the 3D US was conducted using a clarity simulation system. Three breast radiation oncologists independently contoured the seroma target defined as the reference volume (RV) on separate CT and 3D US image sets. Interobserver contouring consistency was evaluated using Conformity Index (CI). Before daily therapy the CBCT image was obtained by a commercially available image system and 3D-US image was obtained by a clarity guidance system. The seroma cavity defined as guidance volume (GV) on 3D-US was contoured on the US-Guide. Calculation of a couch shift required for aligning the GV to the RV. We obtained the shift data after the co-registration of CBCT and planning CT was conducted. Statistical significances of the two sets of data were determined by paired t-test. Results: Three-D US could be a useful adjunct to CT in contouring the postoperative seroma target. The interobserver contouring consistency could be improved by the combination of 3D-US and CT, especially when the seroma clarity was indistinct in CT image. According to 96 groups of registration data the systemic ± random error on x, y, z directions in the clarity guidance system were (2.2 ± 0.3) mm, (4.7 ± 0.2) mm, (4.1 ± 0.5) mm, respectively. In the commercially available image system the results were (2.3 ± 0.2) mm, (4.1 ± 0.3) mm, (3.1 ± 0.5) mm, respectively. The errors of two groups were similar (P > 0.05) on x direction. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) on y and z direction. The 3D-US results were greater than CBCT results in y and z direction. Conclusion: The 3D US can be a powerful complement to CT in contouring the seroma target and it can improve interobserver consistency in radiation after BCT. The number of patients in this study makes it difficult to make undisputed conclusions and it indicates the need for a large multicenter trial to validate the effectiveness of 3D US guidance system in breast cancer patients undergo hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost radiation therapy."
"Wang, L., et al.",2015,Long-term toxicity and outcomes of hypofractionated radiation therapy with an incorporated boost for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To report the 8-year results of hypofractionated radiation therapy (HRT) with an incorporated boost and to compare toxicities and outcomes to propensity matched conventional fractionation (CRT) with sequential boost for early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: The HRT cohort included 75 patients (pts) treated on a prospective Phase II study and 172 pts treated off trial in a similar manner. Inclusions were breast conservation, pts >18 years, Tis-T2, stage 0-II, and whole-breast IMRT with incorporated boost. The whole-breast received 2.25 Gy per fraction (fx) to 45 Gy with an incorporated tumor bed boost to 2.8 Gy per fx for a total of 56 Gy in 20 fx over 4 weeks. Women treated with CRT (whole-breast IMRT to 50 Gy in 2 Gy fx plus a sequential 10-16 Gy boost) were matched to HRT pts in a 2:1 ratio without replacement using a propensity score algorithm for age, T stage, systemic therapy use, bra cup size, type of boost (photon vs electron), grade, lymphovascular invasion, and ER/PR status. Adverse events during RT were considered acute, while events >1.5months after RT were considered late. All side effects were graded based on CTCAE v3. Patient reported cosmesis was scored using the Harvard scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor). Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models with robust standard errors were used to estimate local control (LC). Proportions were evaluated using Mantel-Haenszel tests to account for the effect of matching. Results: Median follow-up was 52 months (range, 3.5-130). Median age was 56 years (range, 31-88). The HRT patients included 19% Tis, 65% T1, and 16% T2 tumors; 86% were node negative. Eighty percent had negative margins, 18% had close (>0 and <2 mm) margins, and 2% had positive margins. The majority of pts received systemic therapy (45% endocrine therapy, 10% chemotherapy, and 22% both). We matched 241 of the 247 HRT pts to 482 CRT pts with no significant differences between groups except more unknown grade in CRT group. Eight-year LC was 97.5% for HRT versus 96.6% in the CRT group (P = .78). There was no significant difference in any grade acute skin erythema in HRT versus CRT (91.3% vs 90.9%, P = .89). Grade 2+ acute side effects were more frequent in CRT versus HRT (47.1% vs 18.7%, P < 0.01). There was no difference in any grade late side effects experienced in the CRT versus HRT group (47.7% vs 41.5%, P = .12); 79% of late side effects in both groups were grade 1. The most common late side effects were edema, hyperpigmentation, erythema, and fibrosis. Mean pt reported cosmesis scores were similar at 3 years for HRT versus CRT (1.9 vs 1.9). Conclusion: The 4-week course of hypofractionated whole-breast radiation with incorporated boost was associated with excellent long-term LC, less acute side effects, similar cosmesis, and late side effects compared to conventional fractionation with sequential boost."
"Wang, M., et al.",2019,Adjuvant Breast Radiotherapy Alone (Without Endocrine Therapy) in Women 70 Years or Older with Early-Stage Breast Cancer Post-Breast Conservation Surgery: A Population-Based Long-Term Follow-Up Study.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Adjuvant breast radiotherapy (RT) following breast conserving surgery (BCS) is the standard of care for women with early stage breast cancer (BC). NCCN guidelines V. 3.2018 recommends omitting RT after BCS in stage I, estrogen-receptor positive (ER+ve) BC patients ≥ 70 years of age who receive adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET). Since RT alone is a treatment option for this group of patients in our health region, we conducted a population-based study to determine the outcomes of women treated with RT alone. Materials/Methods: Data was collected from women aged ≥ 70 with ER+ve, early stage BC treated with BCS followed by adjuvant treatment from 2005 to 2015. Survival endpoints for progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and cause specific survival (CSS) were calculated. Results: A total of 1618 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 75 months. Adjuvant treatments received were: No adjuvant therapy (NAT): 194 (12.0%), RT alone: 587 (36.5%), ET alone: 190 (11.5%), and RT+ET: 647 (40.0%). 10 year PFS rates were: NAT: 83.9%, RT alone: 94.0%, ET alone: 98.2%, and RT+ET: 92.2% (p=0.0001). On multivariate analysis, BCS+RT, BCS+ET and BCS+ET+RT led to significant reduction in recurrences compared to BCS alone with estimated risks of 0.26, 0.06, and 0.14 respectively. 10 year OS rates were 29.2%, 69.1%, 30.1% and 66.3% and 10 year CSS rates were 75.8%, 93.1%, 87.1% and 91.5% for NAT, RT alone, ET alone, and RT+ET respectively. In multivariate analysis, breast cancer death risk was 0.27 (RT alone), 0.51 (ET alone) and 0.19 (RT + ET), compared to NAT after BCS. Conclusion: Our study shows that elderly women with stage I, ER+ve BC had high risk of local recurrence (LR) after BCS if managed with NAT. The risk of LR and the risk of breast cancer deaths were reduced to a similar extent by either RT alone or ET alone. Therefore, RT alone may be an appropriate treatment option for this group of BC patients."

Materials/Methods: For this study, 353 female breast cancer patients (stages I-II), treated with breast-conserving surgery at the institute between November 2002 and February 2012, were retrospectively identified. Median age at diagnosis was 43 (range 20-67) years. Two hundred eighteen patients were treated with SIB-IMRT after breast conserving therapy and 135 patients were treated with late-course boost-IMRT. The tumor bed was delineated and expanded with a margin of 10-15 mm to generate boost planning target volume (PTVt). The whole breast was expanded with a margin of 5 mm to generate the breast PTVb. For the SIB-IMRT group, fractionation schemes used were 27-28 daily fractions of 1.8-1.9 Gray (Gy) to the PTVb and 2.15-2.3 Gy to the boost PTVt. For the late-course boost- IMRT group, fractionation schemes used were 25 daily fractions of 2.0 Gy to the whole breast PTVb, then 5-8 daily fractions of 2.0 Gy to the boost PTVt only. We estimated difference of the two groups on acute radiation injury of the skin and cosmetic outcome according to RTOG and Harris' cosmetic criterion based on the Log-Rank and χ2 test. Results: Median follow-up was 62 (range 1-144) months. The two groups had comparability on age, stages, histopathology, hormone receptor status, postoperative chemotherapy (all P value > 0.05). For all patients, OS was 98.71%, 96.68%, 94.51% at 3, 5, 10-years, respectively. DFS was 95.34%, 90.55%, 88.15% and LCR was 96.86%, 95.43%, 94.60% at 3, 5, 10-years for the whole group, respectively. The 3, 5, 10-year LRR were 3.13%, 4.57%, 5.4% and the DMR was 0.60%, 2.54%, 2.94% for the patients, respectively. There was no significant differences between the SIB-IMRT and late-course boost-IMRT group (X2 = 0.01, P = 0.91). For the acute radiation injury of the skin, there were 155, 56, 7 cases and 86, 43, 5 cases at 1, 2, 3 degree for the SIB-IMRT and late-course boost-IMRT group, respectively. There was no significant differences between the SIB-IMRT and late-course boost-IMRT group (X2 = 1.85, P = 0.40). Meanwhile, in cosmetic outcome, there were 187, 22, 8, 1 cases and 109, 17, 7, 1 cases at great, good, general, bad for the SIB-IMRT and late-course boost-IMRT groups, respectively. There was no significant differences between the SIBIMRT and late-course boost-IMRT group (X2 = 1.29, P = 0.30). Conclusions: In conclusion, SIB-IMRT had the same survival comparing with late-course boost-IMRT. Meanwhile, the acute radiation injury of the skin and cosmetic outcome was the same as late-course boost-IMRT. Therefore, it was worth to popularize in clinical."

For the LCR, it was 98.17%, 96.79%, 95.87%, 95.87% and 95.56%, 94.07%, 93.33%, 93.33% at 3, 5, 8 and 10-years for the SIBIMRT and late-course boost-IMRT group, respectively. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between the groups on LCR (all P value > 0.05). The 3, 5, 8 and 10-year LRR were 1.83%, 3.21%, 4.13%, 4.13% and 4.44%, 5.93%, 6.67%, 6.67% for the SIB-IMRT and late-course boost- IMRT group and there was also no significant differences between the groups (all P value > 0.05). There were no different for DMR of the two groups (all P value > 0.05). Conclusions: In conclusion, SIB-IMRT as part of breast cancer treatment had the same treatment effect in excellent OS, DFS, and LRC rates comparing with late-course boost-IMRT. Meanwhile, the LCR and DMR was the same as late-course boost-IMRT. Therefore, SIB-IMRT was worth to popularize in clinical treatment."
"Wang, S. Y., et al.",2017,Information Needs of Older Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer When Making Radiation Therapy Decisions.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To identify the information older women with early-stage breast cancer need when making radiation therapy decisions, and who patients identify as the main decision maker. Methods and Materials We surveyed (through face-to-face interview, telephone, or mail) women aged ≥65 years who received lumpectomy and were considering or receiving adjuvant radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer. The survey instrument was constructed with input from patient and professional advisory committees, including breast cancer survivors, advocates of breast cancer care and aging, clinicians, and researchers. Participants rated the importance (on a 4-point scale) of 24 statements describing the benefits, side effects, impact on daily life, and other issues of radiation therapy in relation to radiation therapy decision making. Participants also designated who was considered the key decision maker. Results The response rate was 56.4% (93 of 165). Mean age was 72.5 years, ranging from 65 to 93 years. More than 96% of participants indicated they were the main decision maker on receiving radiation therapy. There was wide variation in information needs regarding radiation therapy decision making. Participants rated a mean of 18 (range, 3-24) items as “essential.” Participants rated items related to benefits highest, followed by side effects. Participants who were older than 75 years rated 13.9 questions as essential, whereas participants aged ≤74 years rated 18.7 as essential (P=.018). Conclusions Older women desire information and have more agency and input in the decision-making process than prior literature would suggest. The variation in information needs indicates that future decision support tools should provide options to select what information would be of interest to the participants."
"Ward, M. C., et al.",2019,Radiation Therapy Without Hormone Therapy for Women Age 70 or Above with Low-Risk Early Breast Cancer: A Microsimulation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Hormone therapy without radiation therapy is considered appropriate for women age 70 or above with low-risk, hormone-positive breast cancer after partial mastectomy. However, some patients may prefer radiation without hormone therapy, for which there is minimal modern data. We modeled the comparative efficacy of aromatase inhibition alone without radiation versus radiation alone without hormone therapy. Methods and Materials: We constructed a patient-level Markov model and compared 5 years of anastrozole to a 15-fraction course of radiation without boost or anastrozole. The relative effectiveness between treatments was based on the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-21 trial, which was further adjusted such that the endocrine-alone arm matched the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 and PRIME II trials. Common or severe side effects were considered. Eight survival metrics were assessed and validated against clinical trial data. The cost-efficacy of each strategy was considered using the quality-adjusted life year and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: The model's predicted outcomes matched those demonstrated by modern trials. Aromatase inhibitors were superior in preventing contralateral cancers, with a small impact on the risk of distant metastatic disease. Radiation was superior in preventing ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with a small impact on regional failure. No clinically significant differences were seen in the other 4 oncologic endpoints. Differences in quality-adjusted life years were small, but radiation therapy was $3809 more expensive over the average lifetime. The ICER suggested anastrozole was cost-effective in 62% of probabilistic simulations. However, the ICER was unstable owing to a denominator that approached zero. Conclusions: Women age 70 or above with low-risk early breast cancer who are reluctant or unable to pursue adjuvant aromatase inhibition can safely pursue adjuvant radiation alone with limited differences in outcome and a modest increase in costs."
"Warren, L. E. G., et al.",2014,Management of the regional lymph nodes following breast-conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer: An evolving paradigm.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Radiation therapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery has been the standard of care since randomized trials demonstrated equivalent survival compared to mastectomy and improved local control and survival compared to breast conservation surgery alone. Recent controversies regarding adjuvant radiation therapy have included the potential role of additional radiation to the regional lymph nodes. This review summarizes the evolution of regional nodal management focusing on 2 topics: first, the changing paradigm with regard to surgical evaluation of the axilla; second, the role for regional lymph node irradiation and optimal design of treatment fields. Contemporary data reaffirm prior studies showing that complete axillary dissection may not provide additional benefit relative to sentinel lymph node biopsy in select patient populations. Preliminary data also suggest that directed nodal radiation therapy to the supraclavicular and internal mammary lymph nodes may prove beneficial; publication of several studies are awaited to confirm these results and to help define subgroups with the greatest likelihood of benefit."
"Wei, R. L., et al.",2014,Association between breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme in women: A California cancer registry population-based analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Reports of a relationship between breast cancer patients subsequently developing glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have been reported in the literature, however there are no published analytical studies addressing this association. This current study is a populationbased, retrospective cohort analysis that evaluated the risk of developing GBM in women who were diagnosed with breast carcinoma. Materials/Methods: We analyzed data on 390,429 women from the California Cancer Registry whose first cancer was either invasive or in-situ breast cancer, diagnosed from 1988 through 2009, yielding 339 subsequent diagnosed GBMs. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate risk of GBM, accounting for age at first diagnosis with breast cancer, duration at risk, and race/ethnicity. Results: 339 women diagnosed with an invasive GBM with a median age at diagnosis of GBM of 69 years old and median time between diagnosis of breast cancer and GBM of 5 years (range 1-22). Women diagnosed at an early stage breast cancer, diagnosed with breast cancer at older ages, White Non-Hispanic, and ER positive were more likely to develop GBM A moderately increased SIR of GBM was found among women diagnosed with breast carcinoma, with an SIR of 1.16 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04-1.29). The SIR was 1.41 (95% CI = 1.01 - 1.92) in woman who developed breast carcinoma prior to menopause (≥45 years old). Women who were not on hormonal blockade had higher (SIR 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05-1.36) risk than patients that were on hormonal blockade (RR 1.07, CI 0.87-1.31). Women who did not underwent radiation therapy (RR 1.21, 95% CI = 1.05-1.39), and/or did not undergo chemotherapy (RR 1.23, 95% CI=1.08-1.39) had a higher risk of GBM development. In addition, women with localized disease were more likely to develop GBM (SIR 1.25, 95% CI = 1.09-1.43) as well as women with estrogen receptor positive tumors (SIR 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00-1.37). Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating a statistically significant association between breast cancer and subsequent development of GBM. These results suggest that the risk of developing GBM among women with breast cancer is elevated moderately relative to their peers, but that the risk is substantially elevated in women who develop breast cancer before the age of 45, when the level of estrogen is presumed to be higher before menopause. This preliminary population based data lends support to research showing estrogen receptor markers that link hormonal pathway with GBM formation and/or progression. Further studies are needed to determine specific molecular pathways that may be associated with this clinical association."
"Welzel, G., et al.",2011,Radiation-related quality of life parameters after targeted intraoperative radiotherapy vs. Whole breast radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer: Results from the randomized phase iii trial TARGIT-A.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): In the multicenter Phase III trial TARGIT-Awomen with early breast cancer were randomly treated either with targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT, 20 Gy) during breast-conserving surgery or whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT, 56 Gy). In presence of risk factors, postoperative WBRT (46 - 50/2 Gy) was added after IORT. Initial results show non-inferiority of IORTandWBRT in terms of local recurrence and toxicity (Vaidya et al. Lancet 2010; 376: 91 - 102). Here, we assess radiationrelated quality of life parameters from 123 women of a single centre from the Phase III trial TARGIT-A. Materials/Methods: Radiation-related quality of life was collected using two validated questionnaires of the EORTC (QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR23). In addition, fatigue, anxiety, depression, self-esteem and body image parameters were controlled. The response rate was 72% (n = 88). Forty-six patients were randomized to IORT. Of them, 16 patients were postoperatively treated with additional WBRT, 5 patients did not receive IORT due to technical problems: 4 patients were treated with WBRT, 1 patient refused WBRT. The median age at the time of TARGIT-A entry was 65 years (range, 47 to 84).With a median follow-up time of 25 months (range, 9 to 94), all patients were disease-free at the time of the survey. Results: IORT patients reported less pain, breast and arm symptoms and better role functioning as compared to WBRT patients (mean ± SD: 21.3 ± 33.2 vs. 40.9 ± 32.3 points, p = 0.007; 7.0 ± 14.0 vs. 19.0 ± 20.0 points, p = 0.001; 15.1 ± 22.2 vs. 32.8 ± 28.6 points, p = 0.009; and 78.7 ± 35.2 vs. 61.8 ± 28.3 points, p = 0.007). IORT + WBRT patients reported significantly more pain (mean ± SD: 43.8 ± 32.1 points), breast (mean ± SD: 29.7 ± 22.8 points) and arm symptoms (mean ± SD: 32.6 ± 25.8 points) compared to patients with IORT alone (p values: 0.018 for pain,<0.001 for breast symptoms, and 0.011 for arm symptoms). Conclusions: At a median follow-up of 2 years, important radiation-related quality of life parameters after IORT are superior to WBRT."
"Wen, B., et al.",2016,Predictive value of primary tumor site for locoregional recurrence in early breast cancer patients with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymphadenophy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): To explore the predictive value of primary tumor site for loco-regional recurrence (LRR) in early breast cancer patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes. Materials/Methods: Six hundred fifty-six patients with pT1-2N1M0breast cancer consecutively treated with radical operation without postoperative radiation therapy between March 1998 and December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary tumor sites included outer quadrant in 455 patients, inner quadrant in 156 patients and central quadrant in 45 patients. LRR and LRR-free survival (LRFS) in combination with clinicopathological features were analyzed to screen out patients with higher risk of LRR. Results: The median follow-up time was 64.9 months. The 5-, 10-year LRR for the cohort was 8.6% and 12.9%, respectively; the 5-, 10-year LRFS was 86.2% and 76.4%, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that age of 35 years, inner quadrant tumor and non-luminal subtype were independent risk factors for LRR and LRFS. Patients with primary tumor in inner quadrant showed higher LRR and poorer LRFS when risk factors are 2 than those with tumors in other site. Conclusion: Inner quadrant tumor was an independent predictor for LRR and LRFS in patients with early breast cancer and one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, which would be more accurate in combination with other prognostic indexes including patients' age, pathological T stage, Ki67 status, molecular subtypes."
"Wenz, F., et al.",2013,Local recurrence and survival for the german centers in the targit-a (targeted intraoperative radiation therapy-alone) trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): In 2010, we reported data on local control and early toxicity for the TARGIT-A trial of intraoperative radiation therapy after lumpectomy for early breast cancer. The updated results and first analysis of survival of the whole cohort (n = 3451) were presented at San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2012. We analyzed the German cohort of patients, which was supposed to be more homogeneous than the international cohort (older, low risk [smaller tumors] patients due to legal restrictions for radiation therapy studies in Germany, prepathology IORT only, homogeneous treatment in EBRT arm). Materials/Methods: TARGIT-A was a randomized trial in patients ≥50 years with invasive ductal carcinoma (≤2 cm) undergoing breast conserving surgery comparing Standard fractionated whole breast EBRT (56 Gy) with single dose TARGIT (20 Gy) immediately after tumor excision / at the time of the primary operation. The experimental arm mandated additional EBRT (46 Gy, excluding a boost, n = 126) if adverse features were detected on final pathology (EIC, N+, margin <1 cm) making this a “risk-adapted policy”. Median follow-up was 2 years and 5 months. Results: Seven hundred thirty-four patients recruited from 7 centers in Germany. Patient's ages were 70 years (12%). Tumor sizes were 0-1 cm (35%), 1.1-2 cm (55%), and>2 cm (11%). Grade I 29%, II 59%, III 12%, and node-negative 81%, 1-3 nodes 16%, >3 nodes 3%. At 5-years, the absolute number of events in TARGIT vs EBRT were as follows: Primary outcome: IBR 4 vs 1, Exploratory outcome: All recurrences (breast+axilla+contralateral+ distant recurrence) 11 vs 7, Secondary outcome: All deaths 6 vs 12, Breast Cancer deaths 3 vs 5, Non Breast Cancer deaths 3 vs 7. Conclusions: Patients in the TARGIT-A trial have excellent 5 year outcomes (local control >97%, overall survival ≥94%) in both arms of the trial."

Methods and Materials Eligibility included stage I/II unifocal breast cancer <3 cm in size after lumpectomy with negative surgical margins and 0 to 3 positive axillary nodes without extracapsular extension. The APBI dose delivered was 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions over 5 days for high-dose-rate (HDR); and 45 Gy in 3.5 to 5 days for low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was HDR and LDR MCT reproducibility. This analysis focuses on long-term ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR), contralateral breast cancer events (CBE), regional recurrence (RR), and distant metastases (DM), disease-free, and overall survival. Results The median follow-up was 12.1 years. One hundred patients were accrued from 1997 to 2000; 98 were evaluable; 65 underwent HDR and 33 LDR MCT. Median age was 62 years; 88% had T1 tumors; 81% were pN0. Seventy-seven percent were estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive; 33% received adjuvant chemotherapy and 64% antiendocrine therapy. There have been 4 isolated IBRs and 1 IBR with RR, for 5.2% 10-year IBR without DM. There was 1 isolated RR, 1 with IBR, and 1 with a CBE, for 3.1% 10-year RR without DM. The 10-year CBE rate was 4.2%, with 5 total events. Eleven patients have developed DM, 8 have died of breast cancer, and 22 have died from other causes. The 10-year DFS and OS rates are 69.8% and 78.0%, respectively. Conclusion This multi-institutional, phase 2 trial studying MCT-APBI continues to report durable in-breast cancer control rates with long-term follow-up."
"Wilkinson, B., et al.",2013,Six-year outcomes for phase 1/2 study evaluating hypofractionated accelerated partial-breast irradiation using a 2-day dose schedule.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s):We report six-year outcomes from a Phase I/II trial using balloon-based brachytherapy to deliver APBI in two days. Materials/Methods: Forty-five patients with early-stage breast cancer received adjuvant APBI using a single-lumen brachytherapy applicator as part of a prospective, Phase I/II trial. Total dose was 2800 c Gy in four fractions (700 c Gy BID) with a BED equivalent to whole breast irradiation plus lumpectomy cavity boost. Negative margins and skin to balloon distance > 8mm were required. We evaluated toxicities (CTCAE v3) as well as ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional nodal failure (RNF), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), causespecific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Median age and tumor size were 66 yrs (48-83) and 0.8 cm (0.2- 2.3 cm). Four percent of cases were N1 (n= 2) and 73% were ER positive (n=32). Median follow-up was 6.2 yrs (2.4-8.0 yrs). Median skin distance was 12 mm (8-24 mm) and mean balloon volume was 60 cc (35- 110 cc). Most patients (61%, n=25) received hormonal therapy and 18% received chemotherapy (n=8). Acute and initial chronic toxicities have been previously reported. The vast majority toxicities at this six-year time interval are grade 1 and grade 2 events except for one patient (2%) with grade 3 telangiectasia. Chronic fat necrosis was present in 11% of women (n=5), which was associated with prior infection (p=0.02) or high balloon fill volume (p=0.002). Asymptomatic seromas were noted on mammogram in 13% of cases (n=6) and also associated with higher fill volume (p=0.01). Grade 1-2 telangiectasia was 22% and 9% (n=10, 4), while most women (64%) had some level of fibrosis on exam (grade 1: 32%, grade 2: 32%, n=16, each). Other grade 2 skin toxicities were minimal (4%). Previously reported symptomatic rib fractures in this patient cohort (grade 2, n=3, 7%) have resolved with non-surgical management. Cosmesis at last follow-up was good or excellent in 91% of cases (n=40) and fair in 9% (n=4). There were no IBTR or RNF (sixyear IBTR/RNF rate 0%); however, two patients experienced DM (4% at six years). The six-year actuarial DFS, CSS, and OS were 96%, 100%, and 93%, respectively. ASTRO CS group assignment (S: 27%, C: 64%, US: 9%) did not correlate with local recurrence (no events) or distant metastasis (p=0.31). Conclusions: Treatment of early-stage breast cancer with hypofractionated two-day APBI using single-lumen balloon-based brachytherapy resulted in similar clinical outcomes as standard five-day fractionation. Chronic toxicity was acceptable and appears to be improving with additional clinical follow-up. Improved dosimetric parameters and reduced toxicities may be possible with multi-lumen or strut-based applicators using a similar dose/fractionation schedule."
"Wilkinson, J. B., et al.",2013,Evaluation of current Consensus Statement recommendations for accelerated partial breast irradiation: A pooled analysis of William Beaumont Hospital and American Society of Breast Surgeon MammoSite Registry Trial data.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine whether the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Consensus Statement (CS) recommendations for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) are associated with significantly different outcomes in a pooled analysis from William Beaumont Hospital (WBH) and the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) MammoSite® Registry Trial. Methods and Materials: APBI was used to treat 2127 cases of early-stage breast cancer (WBH, n=678; ASBrS, n=1449). Three forms of APBI were used at WBH (interstitial, n=221; balloon-based, n=255; or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, n=206), whereas all Registry Trial patients received balloon-based brachytherapy. Patients were divided according to the ASTRO CS into suitable (n=661, 36.5%), cautionary (n=850, 46.9%), and unsuitable (n=302, 16.7%) categories. Tumor characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed according to CS group. Results: The median age was 65 years (range, 32-94 years), and the median tumor size was 10.0 mm (range, 0-45 mm). The median follow-up time was 60.6 months. The WBH cohort had more node-positive disease (6.9% vs 2.6%, P<.01) and cautionary patients (49.5% vs 41.8%, P=.06). The 5-year actuarial ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional nodal failure (RNF), and distant metastasis (DM) for the whole cohort were 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.6%. The rate of IBTR was not statistically higher between suitable (2.5%), cautionary (3.3%), or unsuitable (4.6%) patients (P=.20). The nonsignificant increase in IBTR for the cautionary and unsuitable categories was due to increased elsewhere failures and new primaries (P=.04), not tumor bed recurrence (P=.93). Conclusions: Excellent outcomes after breast-conserving surgery and APBI were seen in our pooled analysis. The current ASTRO CS guidelines did not adequately differentiate patients at an increased risk of IBTR or tumor bed failure in this large patient cohort.  Inc."

Methods of APBI delivery included interstitial brachytherapy (n = 221), balloon-based brachytherapy (n = 201), and 3D-CRT (n = 106). Women were assigned a breast cancer subtype (BCST) based on results of testing for estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor (HER-2/neu) receptors. Those without test results for all three receptors were excluded. 278 patients were eligible and submitted for analysis. Receptor subtypes were approximated as follows: ER+ or PR+, HER-2 negative [luminal A (LA), 164 pts.]; ER+, PR+/-, HER-2 positive [luminal B (LB), 81 pts.]; ER/PR-, HER-2+ [HER-2 (H2), 5 pts.]; and ER/PR/HER-2 negative [basal (B), 28 pts.]. A Kaplan-Meier actuarial analysis was performed to estimate ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional nodal failure (RNF), distant metastasis (DM), disease free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Mean age was 66 years with median follow-up of 4.9 years. Basal and H2 subtype patients had higher histologic grades (Gr. 3 = 75% vs. 10% LA/LB, p<0.001), larger tumors (13.0mmvs. 10.7mmLA/LB,p=0.05), and were more likely to receive chemotherapy (68% vs. 15% LA/LB, p<0.001). Basal subtype patients were also more likely to be African American (18% vs. 4% LA/LB,p =0.002). Margin and nodal status were similar between all BCSTs. At five years, IBTR rates were 2.9%, 3.2%, 0%, and 4.8% for LA, LB, H2, and B subtypes, respectively (p = 0.75). The IBTR within the B subtype group was due to a single elsewhere failure; when compared to the cohort with the lowest IBTR rate, the 4.8% rate of local failure for B subtype patients was not statistically different than that for the LA subtype (2.9%, p = 0.30). DM was only seen in LA (2.5%) and LB (1.4%) (p = 0.87). Disease free survival (95-100%), CSS (97%-100%), and OS (80-100%) were also not statistically different (p = 0.98, 0.85, 0.24, respectively). Conclusions: Five year local control rates after treatment with APBI are excellent for luminal, HER-2, and basal phenotypes of early-stage breast cancer. (Table Presented) ."
"Williams, N. R., et al.",2014,Cosmetic outcome before and after external beam or intraoperative radiation therapy for early breast cancer within 1 year of breast-conserving surgery: An objective assessment of patients from a randomized controlled trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The multi-center randomized controlled TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT) trial demonstrated non-inferiority between TARGIT (intraoperative radiation therapy [IORT]) and whole-breast external beamradiation therapy (EBRT) inwomenwith early breast cancer.We have shown in a sub study of 342 patients that cosmesis at one year or laterwas better after TARGIT than EBRT; significant components were LBC (lower breast contour, a measure of symmetry), cX2b (“redness,” a surrogate for radiation induced erythema grade I or II), and sEMDb (scar). The aim of this study was to determine if the single high dose of TARGIT is associated with impaired cosmesis within the first year after surgery. Materials/Methods: EBRT was given as 2 Gy per fraction over 23 or 28 fractions, without a boost. IORT was given as 20 Gy at the surface of the applicator for between 26 and 52 minutes (depending on applicator size). Frontal digital photographs were taken of women participating in the TARGIT Trial at a single center and analyzed, blinded to treatment received, by BCCT.core software which produced Harris scores, and individual scores for symmetry, color, and scar (LBC, cX2b and sEMDb). Results: Seventeen women (9 EBRT, 8 IORT) of median age 65 years (range 50 to 79) had photographs taken at baseline (no more than 5 days prior to surgery), and at one month (median 31 d), at 6m if given EBRT (median 87 d from start), and at one year (median 332 d). All images scored Excellent, Good, or Fair with no differences apparent over time or between treatment groups. At 6m there was a significant change from baseline in cX2b in the women given EBRT (P = 0.0247 by paired t-test, see Table); this change persisted to one year. No change was seen after IORT. There were no significant differences in LBC or sEMDb. Conclusions: This objective assessment of aesthetic outcome in patients from a randomized trial demonstrates that “redness” is significantly worse within 90 d of commencement of EBRT; this change was not seen in women treated with IORT. This study provides further evidence that the objective scoring of cosmesis from photographs using BCCT.core is feasible and may be an approach for standardization, and shows an early beneficial effect of TARGIT on cosmesis.

"Wobb, J. L., et al.",2015,Nomogram for predicting the risk of locoregional recurrence in patients treated with accelerated partial-breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To develop a nomogram taking into account clinicopathologic features to predict locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients treated with accelerated partialbreast irradiation (APBI) for early-stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A total of 2000 breasts (1990 women) were treated with APBI at William Beaumont Hospital (n=551) or on the American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite Registry Trial (n=1449). Techniques included multiplanar interstitial catheters (n=98), balloon-based brachytherapy (n=1689), and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (n=213). Clinicopathologic variables were gathered prospectively. A nomogram was formulated utilizing the Cox proportional hazards regression model to predict for LRR. This was validated by generating a bias-corrected index and cross-validated with a concordance index. Results: Median follow-up was 5.5 years (range, 0.9-18.3 years). Of the 2000 cases, 435 were excluded because of missing data. Univariate analysis found that age <50 years, pre-/perimenopausal status, close/positive margins, estrogen receptor negativity, and high grade were associated with a higher frequency of LRR. These 5 independent covariates were used to create adjusted estimates, weighting each on a scale of 0-100. The total score is identified on a points scale to obtain the probability of an LRR over the study period. The model demonstrated good concordance for predicting LRR, with a concordance index of 0.641. Conclusions: The formulation of a practical, easy-to-use nomogram for calculating the risk of LRR in patients undergoing APBI will help guide the appropriate selection of patients for off-protocol utilization of APBI."
"Wobb, J. L., et al.",2015,Outcomes of APBI patients according to factors not included in the astro consensus guidelines.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Determining which breast cancer (BC) patients are suitable for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is ongoing. This study reports outcomes of APBI patients according to clinicopathologic factors not included in the current ASTRO consensus guidelines. Materials/Methods: Seven hundred fifty-nine patients who received APBI at our institution (N=215 interstitial, N=329 applicator-based, N=215 3D conformal) from 4/1993 to 9/2013 were stratified by ASTRO consensus groups (N=260 suitable, N=388 cautionary, N=111 unsuitable). The entire cohort was analyzed by non-consensus factors including menopausal status, race, personal history of BC, 1st-degree relative with BC, grade, progesterone receptor (PR), Her2 status, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Actuarial rates of local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), and contralateral BC failure (CLBF), were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Median follow-up was 7.6 years (0.1-20.0). Within the entire cohort, the majority of patients were white (90%; 6% African American (AA); 4% other), postmenopausal (89%), ER positive (88%), PR positive (74%), Her2 negative (93%), and grade 2 (48%; all p < 0.001). Endocrine therapy was given in 65% of cases (p=0.05) and chemotherapy in 14% (p<0.001). The table demonstrates 5- and 10-year LR rates, as well as univariate analysis (UVA) for factors predictive of LR. No factors were predictive for RR on UVA with the exception of grade 3 disease in all patients (p=0.009). Nothing was predictive for CLBF except personal history of BC in cautionary patients (p=0.03) and 1st-degree relative with BC in suitable patients (p=0.05), both demonstrating higher rates of CLBF. The use of chemotherapy in unsuitable patients decreased the rate of CLBF (p=0.03). Conclusion: These data suggest that other factors outside of the current ASTRO consensus guidelines should be considered in determining future guideline recommendations for early stage breast cancer patients treated with APBI."
"Wobb, J. L., et al.",2013,Accelerated partial-breast irradiation provides equivalent 10-year outcomes to whole breast irradiation: A matched-pair analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Breast conserving therapy (BCT) represents a standard of care in the management of early stage breast cancer; while adjuvant radiation therapy was traditionally delivered using whole breast irradiation (WBI), accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) offers an alternative to WBI that shortens the duration of treatment and may improve toxicity profiles and quality of life. The purpose of this analysis is to compare clinical outcomes of patients treated with WBI versus APBI. Materials/Methods: A total of 3,009 patients were treated with BCT at single institution between 1980 and 2012 with 2,528 patients receiving WBI and 481 patients receiving APBI (interstitial or balloon-based). A matched-pair analysis was performed with patients matched according to age (+/- 3 years), T stage (Tis vs T1 vs T2), and estrogen receptor (ER) status (+/-). All patients had a minimum of 12 months of follow-up. A total of 247 matches were made with clinical outcomes compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Mean follow-up was 8.1 years for WBI vs 7.8 years for APBI (p < 0.001), a difference of less than 4 months. There were no differences with respect to age (p = 0.88), tumor stage (p = 1.0), or ER status (p = 1.0). Long-term cosmesis was good to excellent in 94% vs 95% of patients (p = 0.78). WBI patients demonstrated a trend for slightly larger tumors (13.0 vs 11.4 mm, p = 0.06). At 10 years, no difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (4% vs 4%, p= 0.11), regional recurrence (1% vs 1%, p = 0.20), distant metastases (3% vs 6%, p = 0.47), disease free survival (93% vs 91%, p = 0.10), or contralateral breast failure (9% vs 3%, p = 0.06) was noted when comparing WBI and APBI. In addition, 10 year cause-specific survival (94% vs 93%, p = .72) and overall survival (83% vs 75%, p = 0.34) were similar. Conclusions: At 10 years, no differences in locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis or survival were found between patients undergoing whole breast irradiation or accelerated partial breast irradiation using interstitial catheter or balloon-based brachytherapy. These data represent one of the only APBI series with prolonged follow-up and show similar outcomes in a matched group of patients undergoing WBI or APBI."
"Wong, A. T., et al.",2015,Three week accelerated whole-breast radiation therapy with concomitant boost for ductal carcinoma in situ in patients younger than 70 years old.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated whole-breast radiation therapy (RT) is an accepted alternative to conventional RT for the treatment of early-stage invasive breast cancer based on several phase III trials. However, these studies did not include patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) nor specifically address younger patients. There is also evidence that RT boost may further improve local control, particularly in younger patients. The objective of this study is to demonstrate feasibility and safety of a 3-week accelerated RT schedule with concomitant boost for patients with DCIS younger than 70 years old. Materials/Methods: Eligible patients with Tis/T1-2 N0 breast cancer status post lumpectomy with negative margins were prospectively enrolled onto a previously-published, Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. 1 For this analysis, we included only patients with DCIS who were <70 years old. Patients received adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy when indicated. The RT dose to the whole-breast was 40.5 Gy in 2.7 Gy/fraction with concomitant boost of 4.5 Gy in 0.3 Gy/fraction. CT simulation was obtained in all cases and 3D conformal field-in-field forward planning was utilized. The whole-breast volume included the entire palpable breast excluding the chest wall and 0.5 cm skin thickness. The boost volume included the lumpectomy cavity as defined by seroma/clips with 1-1.5 cm margin. Dosimetric goals included coverage of the breast volume by the 95% isodose while minimizing the 107% hot spot within the boost volume. Patients were assessed weekly during treatment with post-therapy followup at regular intervals. Results: A total of 62 patients with available follow-up data are included in this analysis. The median age was 56 years (range 37-69 years, 22% < 50 years). Twenty-seven patients (44%) had intermediate-grade and twenty-five (40%) had high-grade DCIS. Estrogen receptor status was positive in 54 patients (87%) but only 47 patients (60%) received antiestrogen therapy. At a median follow-up of 43 months (range 5-129 months), there have been no local or regional recurrences. No acute grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted. There has been no adverse effect on cosmesis as evaluated by digital photographs. Conclusion: We report excellent local control with 3-week accelerated RT with concomitant boost for the treatment of DCIS in patients < 70 years old. This schedule is well tolerated with no detrimental effect on cosmesis. There is a paucity of data supporting the feasibility of accelerated RT among this subset of breast cancer patients. This study contributes to the growing body of literature that suggests accelerated RT may be used in these patients. Follow-up is ongoing as we await the results of cooperative group trials (RTOG 1005)."
"Wong, F., et al.",2010,"Her2-neu positivity prognosticates for poor disease control in asian women with small, node negative breast cancer treated with Conservation Therapy.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The treatment of breast cancer patients with small, node-negative and HER-2 positive tumors is controversial. Limited data exist on the outcome of Asian patients with early stage breast cancer and HER-2 positivity. We report the outcomes of this group of patients who received treatment at our institution, evaluating the prognosticative values of HER-2 status in small, node negative disease. Materials/Methods: A retrospective review of 488 pT1N0 (40% pT1a/b) breast cancer patients who received treatment at the National Cancer Centre Singapore was performed. After completing breast-conserving surgery between 1995 and 2008, these patients were given adjuvant radiotherapy to the whole breast, 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks followed by boost of 10 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week to the tumor bed. Results: The median follow-up of these patients is 46 months. Seventeen (8%) and 2 (1%) patients with T1a/b tumors received chemotherapy and anti-HER-2 therapy respectively compared to 14 (5%) and 89 (31%) patients with T1c tumor. Five-year recurrence free survival (RFS) is 96.6% for HER-2 negative tumors and 79.6% for HER-2 positive tumors (p<0.0001). Five-year local relapse rates was higher for HER-2 positive tumor (8.4%) vs. HER-2 negative tumor (1.6%), p<0.0001. In the 196 patients with tumors < 1 cm, 5-year RFS for HER-2 negative tumors is 96.3% vs. 80.8% (p = 0.002) for HER-2 positive patients. Among hormone sensitive tumors, 5-year RFS is lower for HER-2 positive tumors vs. HER-2 negative tumors: 85.2% vs. 97.7%, (p<0.0001). Among hormone insensitive tumors, 5-year RFS is lower for HER-2 positive tumors vs. HER-2 negative tumors: 74.8% vs. 91.3%, (p<0.0001). After multivariate analysis (MVA) adjusting for T1a/b vs. T1c stage, hormone sensitivity and age at diagnosis, HER- 2 positive tumors were associated with worse 5-year RFS (HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.7 to 14.4), Distant-RFS (HR, 10.3; 95% CI 3.0 to 34.5) and overall survival (HR, 11.6; 95% CI, 2.7 to 50.3). After MVA adjusting for hormone sensitivity and age at diagnosis, T1a/ b tumors were associated with a marginally decreased 5-year RFS (HR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 41) but equivalent overall survival. Conclusions: Among small, node-negative tumors, HER-2 positivity imparts higher risk of local and distant relapse. This effect is seen in both hormone sensitive and insensitive tumors. Even among tumors\1 cm, HER-2 prognosticates for a poorer RFS despite our small patient number, few events and short follow-up. More aggressive treatment should be considered in the management of small, node negativeHER-2 positive breast cancers despite the lack of consensus in the use of chemotherapy and targeted therapy in tumors < 1 cm."
"Wong, J. S., et al.",2000,"The relationship between lymphatic vessell invasion, tumor size, and pathologic nodal status: Can we predict who can avoid a third field in the absence of axillary dissection?",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Tangential (2-field) radiation therapy to the breast and lower axilla is typically used in our institution for treating patients with early-stage breast cancer who have 0-3 positive axillary nodes, as determined by axillary dissection, whereas a third supraclavicular/axillary field is added for patients with 4 or more positive nodes. However, dissection may result in complications and added expense. We, therefore, assessed whether clinical or pathologic factors of the primary tumor could reliably predict, in the absence of an axillary dissection, which patients with clinically negative axillary nodes have such limited pathologic nodal involvement that they might be effectively treated with only tangential fields. This would eliminate both the complications of axillary dissection and the added complexity and potential morbidity of a supraclavicular/axillary field. Methods and Materials: In this study, 722 women with clinical Stage I or II unilateral invasive breast cancer of infiltrating ductal histology, with clinically negative axillary nodes, at least 6 lymph nodes recovered on axillary dissection, and central pathology review were treated with breast-conserving therapy from 1968 to 1987. Pathologic nodal status was assessed in relation to clinical T stage, the presence of lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), age, histologic grade, and the location of the primary tumor. Results: LVI, T stage, and tumor location were each significantly correlated with nodal status on univariate analysis. Ninety-seven percent of LVI-negative patients had 0-3 positive axillary nodes compared to 87% of LVI-positive patients. There was no association between T stage and extent of axillary involvement within LVI-negative and LVI-positive subgroups. In a logistic regression model, only LVI remained a significant predictor of having 4 or more positive nodes, although tumor size was of borderline significance. The odds ratio for LVI (positive vs. negative) as a predictor of having 4 or more positive nodes was 3.9 (95% CI, 2.0-7.6).Conclusion: For patients with clinical T1-2, N0, infiltrating ductal carcinomas, the presence of LVI is predictive of having 4 or more positive axillary nodes. Only 3% of patients with clinical T1-2, N0, LVI-negative breast cancers had 4 or more positive nodes on axillary dissection. Such patients may be reasonable candidates for treatment with tangential radiation fields in the absence of axillary dissection. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc."
"Wong, J. S., et al.",1997,Treatment outcome after tangential radiation therapy without axillary dissection in patients with early-stage breast cancer and clinically negative axillary nodes.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To determine the risk of nodal failure in patients with early- stage invasive breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes treated with two-field tangential breast irradiation alone, without axillary lymph node dissection or use of a third nodal field. Methods and Materials: Between 1988 and 1993, 986 evaluable women with clinical Stage I or H invasive breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Of these, 92 patients with clinically negative nodes received tangential breast irradiation (median dose, 45 Gy) followed by a boost, without axillary dissection. The median age was 69 years (range, 49- 87). Eighty-three percent had T1 tumors. Fifty-three patients received tamoxifen, 1 received chemotherapy, and 2 patients received both. Median follow-up time for the 79 survivors was 50 months (range, 15-96). Three patients (3%) have been lost to follow-up after 20-32 months. Results: No isolated regional nodal failures were identified. Two patients developed recurrence in the breast only (one of whom had a single positive axillary node found pathologically after mastectomy). One patient developed simultaneous local and distant failures, and six patients developed distant failures only. One patient developed a contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ, and two patients developed other cancers. Conclusion: Among a group of 92 patients with early-stage breast cancer (typically T1 and also typically elderly) treated with tangential breast irradiation alone without axillary dissection, with or without systemic therapy, there were no isolated axillary or supraclavicular regional failures. These results suggest that it is feasible to treat selected clinically node-negative patients with tangential fields alone. Prospective studies of this approach are warranted."
"Wong, M. L., et al.",2012,A single-institutional experience using the strut-adjusted volume implant for accelerate partial breast irradiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an increasingly popular treatment modality for the treatment of early-stage invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ. We report our institutional experience with the use of the strut-adjusted volume implant (SAVI) for APBI treatments. Material/Methods: Fifty-one patients were treated who had either DCIS or early-stage invasive breast cancer treated with a lumpectomy with negative margins of at least 2 mm. The device was inserted by a close technique and a total dose of 34.0 Gy in 10 fractions was delivered twice daily. Planning target volume was created using computed tomography-based threedimensional planning with a 1.0-cm expansion of the lumpectomy cavity. Skin dose was measured dosimetrically, with skin constraints <125% of the prescription. Toxicities were graded, and patients were assessed at various intervals. Results: The median age of patients in our study is 64 with a median follow-up time of 12 months. Two (3.9%) of the patients were found to have a true local recurrence and 1 patient developed a new primary in the contralateral breast. One patient died from a non-breast cancer related cause. Eighty-six percent of the patients had an excellent cosmesis and 11.8% had cosmesis. Additionally, dosimetry for the SAVI was found to be excellent with no device having to be pulled due to insufficiency dosimetric coverage of the surgical bed or unacceptable proximity to the skin or chest wall. Conclusion: APBI as delivered by a SAVI applicator is associated with excellent local control for patients with early-stage breast and the majority of patients have good to excellent cosmesis. The results from NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 will provide more definitive answers to the efficacy of APBI as compared to standard whole breast irradiation but in the interim, results such as our own can help guide treatments off-protocol. Furthermore, the SAVI applicator compares favorably to other breast brachytherapy devices and external beam partial breast irradiation."
"Wong, W. W., et al.",2010,Five-year outcome of a prospective study evaluating tumor bed boost with intra-operative electron irradiation (IOERT) in breast Conserving Treatment for T1/T2 N0 Breast Cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The standard radiation treatment for early stage breast cancer includes whole breast external beam irradiation (EBRT) for approximately 5 weeks, plus an electron beam boost to the tumor bed for 1-2 weeks. We conducted a phase II study for patients with T1/T2 N0 breast cancers in which a single fraction of IOERT was used as the boost, thus shortening the treatment duration by 1-2 weeks. Materials/Methods: Patients underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. If the surgical margin and lymph nodes were free of disease by frozen section, 10 Gy of IOERT using 6-12 MeV electrons was delivered to the tumor bed by a dedicated mobile linear accelerator in the operating room. After adequate wound healing, 48 Gy EBRT was given to the whole breast in 24 fractions. Results: Fifty-two patients (pts) were enrolled between 2/2003 and 1/2005. The median age was 68. There were 44 T1 and 8 T2 tumors. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy was given to 11 and 27 patients, respectively. With a median follow-up of 61 months (range, 29-81 months), the 5-year overall survival, local control and distant control rates were 92%, 98%, and 96%, respectively. One pt developed an local in-field relapse. Two pts developed distant metastases. Two pts died of inter-current disease. Most toxicities improved with time. At last follow-up, the toxicity scores were: skin-grade 1 in 2 pts (4%); breast edemagrade 1 in 2 pts (4%) and grade 2 in 1 pt (2%); cosmesis-excellent in 33 pts (66%), good in 11 pts (21%), fair in 6 pts (12%) and poor in 2 pts (4%); subcutaneous tissues-grade 1 in 13 pts (25%), grade 2 in 4 pts (8%); lung-grade 1 in 1 pt (2%); arm edema-grade 1 in 4 pts (8%), grade 2 in 2 pts (8%). No pt had any rib toxicity at last follow-up. Five pts (10%) had clinical and/or radiographic findings of fat necrosis. One pt developed nipple discharge at 13 months, requiring re-excision and ultimately a thoracodorsal artery perforator muscle flap for a non-healing wound. Another pt developed significant fibrosis and breast deformity after aspiration of a seroma. Late breast infection occurred in 4 pts (8%) at up to 6 years post-treatment. Two of these pts required incision and drainage.A cost analysis showed a mean savings of > 1524/case in the cost of treatment compared to standard external electron beam boost. Conclusions: Our study shows that 10 Gy of IOERT can be used as the tumor bed boost in lieu of 6-8 days of standard electron beam treatment with excellent local control of disease at 5 years, allowing a shortened treatment time and lower cost. Late complications included fat necrosis in 10% of patients and 8% late infections. Late surgical manipulation of the lumpectomy bed may potentially result in wound healing difficulty and more pronounced tissue fibrosis."

W., et al.",2011,Five-year outcome of a prospective study evaluating hypofractionated whole breast external beam irradiation and tumor bed boost with intra-operative electron irradiation (IOERT) for T1/T2 no breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The standard radiation treatment for early stage breast cancer includes whole breast external beam irradiation (EBRT) for approximately 5 weeks, plus an electron beam boost to the tumor bed for 1-2 weeks. We conducted an IRB approved phase II study for patients with T1/T2N0 breast cancers in which a single fraction of IOERT was used as the boost, followed by hypofractionated whole breast irradiation for 16 fractions, thus shortening the treatment duration by about 3-4 weeks. Materials/Methods: Patients underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. If the surgical margin and lymph nodes were free of disease by frozen section, 12Gy of IOERT using 6-12MeV electrons was delivered to the tumor bed by a dedicated mobile linear accelerator in the operating room. After adequate wound healing, 40Gy EBRT was given to the whole breast in 16 daily fractions. Results: Forty-five patients (pts) were enrolled between 2/2005 and 8/2006. The median age was 71. There were 38 T1 and 7 T2 tumors. Median tumor size was 1.1cm. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy was given to 4 and 35 patients, respectively. Two pts did not complete EBRT: one had mastectomy and another declined treatment after IOERT. With a median follow-up of 59 months (range: 17-71 months), the 5-year overall survival, local control and distant control rates were 98%, 100% and 100%, respectively. One pt died of inter-current disease. Most toxicities improved with time. At last followup, the toxicity scores were: skin-grade 1 in 1 pt (2%); breast edema-grade 1 in 2 pts (5%) and grade 2 in 1 pt (2%); cosmesis- excellent in 26 pts (60%), good in 8 pts (19%), fair in 7 pts (17%) and poor in 2 pts (5%); subcutaneous tissues-grade 1 in 15 pts (35%), grade 2 in 2 pts (5%), grade 3 in 1 pt (2%); arm edema-grade 1 in 1 pt (2%). Four pts (9%) had clinical and/ or radiographic findings of fat necrosis. Possible mastitis/breast infection was seen in 9 pts (20%), 5 before starting EBRT and 4 during EBRT. These pts were treated with antibiotics. Three pts (7%) had breast infection after completion of radiation. Four pts (9%) had breast pain for a prolonged period, but only one had residual mild pain at last follow-up. The use of IOERT boost achieved a mean savings of ≥1524/case in the cost of treatment compared to standard external electron beam boost. Conclusions: The combination of 12Gy of IOERT and 40Gy/16 fractions of whole breast EBRT achieved excellent local control of disease at 5 years with a significant saving in cost and treatment time. Acute toxicity included mastitis/ possible infection in 20% of pts. Late complications included fat necrosis in 9%, and late breast infections in 7% of pts."
"Woodward, W. A., et al.",2003,Locoregional recurrence after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and postmastectomy: Implications for breast cancer patients with early-stage disease and predictors for recurrence after postmastectomy radiation.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To compare rates of locoregional recurrence (LRR) after mastectomy, doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and radiation with those of patients receiving mastectomy and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy without radiation and to determine predictors of LRR after postmastectomy radiation. Methods: Kaplan-Meier freedom-from-LRR rates were calculated for 470 patients treated with mastectomy, doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and postmastectomy radiation in five single-institution clinical trials. The LRR rates in these patients were compared to previously reported rates in 1031 patients treated without radiation in the same trials. Results: Median follow-up was 14 years. Irradiated patients had significantly less favorable prognostic factors for LRR than did unirradiated patients. Despite this, in all subsets of node-positive patients, postmastectomy radiation led to lower rates of LRR. This included patients with T1 or T2 tumors and one to three positive nodes (10-year LRR rates of 3% vs. 13%, p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis of LRR for patients with this stage of disease revealed that no radiation, close/positive margins, gross extracapsular extension, and dissection of <10 nodes predicted for increased LRR (hazard ratios 6.25, 4.61, 3.27, and 2.66, respectively). Significant predictors of LRR for patients treated with postmastectomy radiation were higher number and ≥20% positive nodes, larger tumor size, lymphovascular space invasion, and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease. Recursive partitioning analysis revealed ER-negative status to be the most powerful discriminator of LRR in irradiated patients. Conclusions: Postmastectomy radiation decreases LRR for patients with breast cancer, including those with Stage II breast cancer and one to three positive lymph nodes.  Inc."
"Woolf, D. K., et al.",2014,Biological dosimetry with γ-H2AX foci using radiation therapy for breast cancer as a model.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The phosphorylated histone H2AX protein (γ-H2AX) is expressed after induction of DNA double strand breaks caused by ionizing radiation, created as lymphocytes pass through and adjacent to the irradiated field.We have used γ-H2AX foci formation in peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate marker of radiation dose to the heart and great vessels in patients receiving adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for early breast cancer to evaluate the differences between the radiation therapy techniques in terms of dose to the heart, and to assess the utility of this biological technique to provide valid dosimetry data. Material/Methods: Thirty-four patients were recruited, having either EBRT or IORT as part of a randomized controlled trial. The main inclusion criteria were adult females with early breast cancer suitable for breast conserving surgery and the main exclusion criteria were previous malignancy, recent exposure to radiation (excluding CT planning scan) and prior chemotherapy. Blood sampleswere taken immediately prior to and 30minutes after either first fraction of EBRT (2.67 Gy) or after IORT treatment, and then rapidly processed to allow quantification of the γ-H2AX biomarker in lymphocytes. This study had approval from the Local Research and Ethics Committee. Results: Data were available for 31 patients. Mean increase in γ-H2AX foci number per cell were 0.935 in the EBRT group and 0.203 in the IORT group which were significantly different (p = 0.009). Mean heart dose in the EBRT group was 1.24 Gy as derived from CT planning data. Correlation in the EBRT group between heart dose in gray and change in mean γ-H2AX foci number per cell showed a correlation coefficient of -0.154 (p = 0.542). Using previously estimated doses to the heart from IORT (0.01 Gy) correlation coefficient for all patients was 0.375 (p = 0.037). Conclusions: Biological dosimetry with the γ-H2AX biomarker is useful to differentiate large dose differences such as between EBRT and IORT and suggests a higher cardiac dose from EBRT. However this study did not demonstrate a correlation between planned dose to the heart and change in the γ-H2AX foci within EBRT patients. One possible reason for this is that the increase in γ-H2AX foci number detected is due to an increased whole body radiation dose rather than a greater volume of blood from the heart being within the radiation field."
"Woolston, C. M., et al.",2011,Redox protein expression predicts radiotherapeutic response in early-stage invasive breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: Early-stage invasive breast cancer patients have commonly undergone breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy. In a large majority of these patients, the treatment is effective; however, a proportion will develop local recurrence. Deregulated redox systems provide cancer cells protection from increased oxidative stress, such as that induced by ionizing radiation. Therefore, the expression of redox proteins was examined in tumor specimens from this defined cohort to determine whether such expression could predict response. Methods and Materials: The nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of nine redox proteins (glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutaredoxin, glutathione peroxidase 1, 3, and 4, and glutathione S-transferase-θ, -π, and -α) was assessed using conventional immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of 224 tumors. Results: A high cytoplasmic expression of glutathione S-transferase-θ significantly correlated with a greater risk of local recurrence (p = .008) and, when combined with a low nuclear expression (p = .009), became an independent predictive factor (p = .002) for local recurrence. High cytoplasmic expression of glutathione S-transferase-θ also correlated with a worse overall survival (p = .009). Low nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 (p = .002) correlated with a greater risk of local recurrence and was an independent predictive factor (p = .005). These proteins did not correlate with tumor grade, suggesting their function might be specific to the regulation of oxidative stress rather than alterations of tumor phenotype. Only nuclear (p = .005) and cytoplasmic (p = .001) expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 correlated with the tumor grade. Conclusions: Our results support the use of redox protein expression, namely glutathione S-transferase-θ and glutathione peroxidase 3, to predict the response to radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer patients. If incorporated into routine diagnostic tests, they have the potential to aid clinicians in their stratification of patients into more tailored treatment regimens. Future targeted therapies to these systems might improve the efficacy of reactive oxygen species-inducing therapies, such as radiotherapy.  Inc."
"Wooten, C. E., et al.",2010,Accuboost therapy with implantable dose verification: Proving the principle over an initial 30 applications.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the capability of internal dosimeters to act as both a fiducial marker and interstitial dosimeter in the treatment of early stage breast cancer with Noninvasive Image-guided Breast Brachytherapy (NIIGBB). Materials/Methods: We utilized internal dosimeters (Dose Verification Systems) in external beam breast patients as quality assurance for actual dose delivered. In external beam therapy, the device is used for both dosimetric verification and as a fiducial marker. Recently, NIIGBB was prescribed as surgical bed boost to three of our patients in whom internal dosimeters had already been implanted for use during whole breast external beam therapy. The dosimeters were used as the targeting fiducial marker for the NIIGBB therapy, and because dosimetric information was available, we evaluated the utility of an internal dosimetric device in breast patients receiving surgical bed boost through the use of NIIGBB. Following each 200 c Gy (dosed to midplane) fraction of surface brachytherapy, the expected dose at the location of the dosimeter was verified by comparison of the orthogonal kV images to the predicted dose distribution. This expected dose, rather than the prescription at mid-plane, was compared to the dosimeter findings. Results: The internal dosimeter successfully recorded a value for delivered dose that was consistent with the expected dose for each fraction of NIIGBB. A plurality of fractions fell within +/- 6% of expected dose. The total range of deviation from expected values was +/- 12%. Wide variation in absolute dose was observed and attributed to the mid-plane dosing technique utilized in NIGBB when the dosimeter was not located at mid-plane. Conclusions: Data collected suggests that internal dosimeters designed for external beam use can be used as both a fiducial marker and dosimeter in the context of NIIGBB. In total, 30 dose fractions were given and the dose delivered to the tumor bed for each set was successfully measured by the implanted dosimeter. 7 of the 15 measured doses delivered to the tumor bed fell within the range of +/-6% of expected dosage. This led us to conclude that if internal dosimeters are to have a role in the expanding technology of NIIGBB then we must consider dosing to the location of the dosimeter rather than mid-plane. With mid-plane dosing and non-mid-plane internal dosimeter location, we are comparing measured dose to an extrapolated expected dose at a variable distance from the prescription plane. Dosing to the dosimeter would allow for a better evaluation of measured dose to prescribed dose as a quality assurance parameter. Furthermore, dosing to dosimeter location offers the advantage of prescribing to the surgeon's representation of the surgical bed, rather than to a plane in space without specific anatomic relationship."
"Wratten, C., et al.",2004,Fatigue during breast radiotherapy and its relationship to biological factors.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Introduction Fatigue is commonly reported in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast conservation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods Patients with early breast cancer participating in a prospective study of the impact of inflammatory processes on early and delayed breast morbidity were assessed for fatigue levels using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) fatigue subscale before and at intervals during and after radiotherapy. Blood for analysis of a variety of circulating cytokines, coagulation factors, peripheral blood indices and biochemical factors was collected at the same time points. Results Fifty-two eligible patients were assessed. Twenty-one patients (43%) developed significant fatigue during radiotherapy, whereas 28 (54%) developed minimal or no fatigue. Fatigue appeared to plateau between week 4 of treatment and 2 weeks after treatment. The fatigue was beginning to settle by 6 weeks after treatment. Significant fatigue was predicted by a higher baseline fatigue score, red cell count, neutrophil count, and D-dimer level. Baseline fatigue correlated with higher body mass index, C-reactive protein, soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, von Willebrand factor antigen, interleukin-6, ICAM-1, hemoglobin and red cell, monocyte, and neutrophil counts. There were also significant correlations between body mass index and tissue plasminogen activator, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, ICAM-1, and red cell count. After these factors were controlled for, baseline fatigue was seen to be associated with higher body mass index, soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator, von Willebrand factor antigen, monocyte count, and neutrophil count. Multiple logistic regression procedures indicated that the most predictive factors for fatigue during radiotherapy were higher baseline fatigue level and higher baseline neutrophil and red cell counts. Conclusion This study has shown that significant fatigue is common in patients receiving breast irradiation and is precipitated during radiotherapy in some patients but not others. The factors shown to be associated with fatigue in this study will be helpful in shaping future studies.  Inc."
"Wright, J. L., et al.",2017,Use of Geriatric Assessment Tools in Selecting Therapies in Women Aged ≥70 Years With Hormone Receptor–Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Preliminary Experience With a Quality Improvement Initiative.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To develop a multidisciplinary algorithmic approach to management of women aged ≥70 years with clinically staged T1N0 hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, including geriatric assessments predicting life expectancy and the likelihood of functional decline in the near future, in the context of a program-wide quality improvement initiative, to better select patients for therapeutic interventions. Methods and Materials Two geriatric assessment tools, the Combined Lee-Schonberg Index and the Vulnerable Elderly Scale, were introduced into our clinical workflow to predict long-term mortality and likelihood of functional decline. Scores from these tools, along with patient preferences and clinical features, were incorporated into a preoperative algorithm addressing the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and a postoperative algorithm addressing the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Results The algorithms were approved for use in August 2015. Twenty-four patients were identified by in-clinic screening and have been managed using the algorithms as a guide. Mean patient age was 80 years (range, 71-89 years). Per the preoperative algorithm, consideration of omission of SLNB was an option in 11 of 24 patients (46%), and in total 18 of 24 (75%) opted against SLNB. Per the postsurgical algorithm, consideration of omission of adjuvant RT was an option for 19 of 24 patients (79%), and in total 17 of 24 (71%) opted to forego RT. Conclusion Incorporation of simple geriatric assessments seems to have had a marked impact on decision making regarding both surgical and adjuvant therapies for women aged ≥70 years with early-stage hormone-positive breast cancer compared with historical patterns, with ≥71% omission of both SLNB and adjuvant RT in patients managed according to an institutional quality improvement initiative."
"Wu, S. P., et al.",2016,The effect of breast irradiation on cardiac disease in women enrolled on BCIRG-001 at 10-year follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer has been shown to increase the risk of long term cardiac morbidity. Modern techniques such as 3D-CRT and IMRT decrease cardiac dose from RT. This study investigated cardiac toxicity associated with breast RT at 10 year follow-up in BCIRG-001, a phase III trial comparing adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy (FAC) with anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy (TAC) in women with lymph node (LN) positive early breast cancer. Materials/Methods: Prospectively collected data from all 746 patients in the control arm (FAC) of BCIRG-001 at 10 year follow up was analyzed from Project Data Sphere. Cardiac toxicities examined were grade 3 or 4 congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), and LVEF decrease of >20% from baseline. Toxicities were compared between patients who did and did not receive RT, left sided versus right sided RT, left sided versus no RT, and left internal mammary nodal (IMN) versus no RT. Statistical comparisons of categorical data were completed using the chi-square test and Fisher exact test, and multivariate analysis was performed using binomial logistic regression in the R statistical package. Results: Of the 746 patients, 538 (72%) received RT to a median dose of 50 Gy (25-65 Gy). Among the RT patients, 266 (49%) received left sided RT, 393 (69%) received regional nodal irradiation (RNI), and 51 (13% of RNI group) were treated to the IMNs (31% left-sided). There was no significant difference in age, KPS, menopausal status, ER/PR, or HER2 status, tumor grade, history of diabetes, MI, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or arrhythmia, between patients receiving RT and those that did not. Per protocol, nearly all patients who underwent lumpectomy received RT; 241/439 (55%) of patients who underwent mastectomy received RT. There was thus fewer RT patients (versus non-RT patients) who underwent mastectomy (55% vs. 95%, P < 0.001) and more RT patients with >3 positive LN (42% vs 28%, P = 0.001). MI occurred in 6 RT patients versus 8 patients non-RT patients (1% vs 4%, P = 0.8). No patient treated with left sided or left IMN RT experienced MI. Grade 3/4 CHF was seen in 14 RT patients versus 3 non-RT patients (3% vs. 1.5%, P = 0.9). Four of 14 RT patients (29%) died of complications of CHF versus no non-RT patients. Evaluable baseline echocardiograms were available in 270 patients. Among these, 35/198 RT patients had LVEF decrease of >20% baseline versus 6/72 who did not receive RT (18% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.09). There was no difference between LVEF decreases in rightsided versus left-sided RT. On multivariate logistic regression, MI is significantly associated with previous history of MI, obesity, and older age. Conclusion: There is no significant increase in risk of MI at 10 years in LN positive women treated with breast RT and uniform adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in this modern prospective study with long-term cardiac outcomes. The higher incidence of CHF morbidity and mortality warrants further study with a larger randomized cohort."
"Wu, S. P., et al.",2017,Effect of Breast Irradiation on Cardiac Disease in Women Enrolled in BCIRG-001 at 10-Year Follow-Up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose To investigate cardiac toxicity associated with breast radiation therapy (RT) at 10-year follow-up in BCIRG-001, a phase 3 trial comparing adjuvant anthracycline chemotherapy (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) with anthracycline–taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) in women with lymph node–positive early breast cancer. Methods and Materials Prospective data from all 746 patients in the control arm (fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) of BCIRG-001 at 10-year follow-up were obtained from Project Data Sphere. Cardiac toxicities examined included myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, and relative and absolute left ventricular ejection fraction decrease of >20% from baseline. Toxicities were compared between patients who received RT versus no RT, left-sided RT versus no RT, and internal mammary nodal RT versus no RT. Results Of the 746 patients, 559 (75%) received RT to a median dose of 50 Gy. Myocardial infarction occurred in 3 RT patients (0.5%) versus 6 no-RT patients (3%) (P=.01). Heart failure was seen in 15 RT patients (2.7%) versus 3 no-RT patients (1.6%) (P=.6). Among these, 35 RT patients (18%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction relative decrease of >20% baseline versus 7 (10%) who did not receive RT (P=.1). Arrhythmias were more common in RT patients (3.2%) versus no-RT patients (0%) (P=.01). On univariable and multivariable analysis HF was not significantly associated with RT, and MI was negatively associated with RT. Conclusions In this retrospective analysis of prospective toxicity outcomes, there is an increased risk of arrhythmias but no clear evidence of significantly increased risk of MI or HF at 10 years in lymph node–positive women treated with breast RT and uniform adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. Given the low incidence of these outcomes, studies with larger numbers are needed to confirm our findings."
"Wu, S. P. P., et al.",2017,The impact of adjuvant radiation timing on survival after breast conserving surgery in early stage breast cancer patients.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate the impact of increasing interval between breast conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) on overall survival (OS). Purpose/Objective(s): Women with pT1-2, N0-1 breast cancer who underwent BCS and no chemotherapy and with known time between surgery and radiation were identified in the National Cancer Database (2004-2011). Patients with mortality prior to 6 months were excluded to minimize survivorship bias. We evaluated time from surgery to time of initiation (TTI) of radiation therapy. Patients were divided into two groups based on TTI of ≤12 weeks (vs. >12 weeks). The association of increasing TTI and covariates was assessed with logistic regression. The effect of TTI on OS was analyzed with a multivariable (MVA) Cox model adjusting for clinicopathologic, treatment and demographic variables. A recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) via conditional inference trees with logrank statistics was used to estimate the optimal threshold with the greatest difference in OS. A 2-fold cross-validation of the RPA was repeated 1,000 times to assess threshold robustness. Results: From 2004 to 2011, a total of 233,518 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 72 months (range 6-147). The median age was 64 (range 19-90), 89% had T1 disease, 93% had N0 disease, 86% were white, 91% ER positive, 37% had low grade disease, 3.6% had positive margins, 27% were treated at an academic or research center, and 87% had Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0. Median TTI was 48 days (IQR 35-66 days) for the entire cohort. Shorter TTI was associated with patients who were older, white, have lower grade tumors, treated at a comprehensive community cancer program, who had received hormone therapy (HT), have Medicare, and higher educational levels. The 5yr OS for ≤12 weeks was 93.5% (93.5%-93.7%) and for patients >12 weeks it was 92.4% (92.1%-92.8%). This difference was significant on univariate analysis (HR 1.13, 1.09-1.18, p < 0.0001) and TTI remained significant (HR 1.16 (1.12-1.20), p<0.001) in MVA Cox model. Demographic and treatment factors significant for OS on univariate analysis include age, T-stage, N-stage, (ER) status, TTI, race, grade, histology, lymphovascular invasion, performance status, ER status, HT, surgical margins, facility type, education, income, insurance status, and distance from treatment facility. RPA identified a TTI of 86 days as the threshold (IQR 85-91) with the greatest difference in OS (HR 1.14 (1.10-1.18), p <0.001). Conclusion: In this largest analysis of early stage breast cancer patients, we find that increasing interval between BCS and RT is significantly associated with decreased OS. Time to radiation greater than 86 days is most consistently associated with increased risk of death."
"Xanthopoulos, E. P., et al.",2015,Postoperative complications following intraoperative breast radiation therapy (IORT).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Definitive breast conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiation is a common treatment for many early stage breast cancers. The sub-acute post-operative complications of definitive surgery are well documented. More recently, IORT has been increasingly used for low risk disease. However, the sub-acute post-operative complication profile of this therapy is less well studied. Materials/Methods: Using a prospectively consented cohort of 82 consecutive women that received IORT from September 2013 to February 2015 for early stage breast cancer, we retrospectively reviewed charts for sub-acute postoperative complications. Univariate logistic regression looked for risk factors associated with sub-acute complications. The rate of post-operative complication was too low to permit meaningful multivariate regression. Results: The women had median age of 67 years (range 45 - 91). 70% were white; 11% black; & 12% Hispanic. 93% were post-menopausal. 34% had DCIS; the rest had £IIA disease. Median tumor size was 1 cm (0.1 - 3 cm) All underwent lumpectomy, receiving a single-dose of cephalosporin pre-operatively. 85% of patients had negative initial margins; all had negative final margins. On median, they had 0 positive & 1 excised node. All women received 20 Gy IORT via an orthovoltage source (50kV) prescribed to the surface using a spherical applicator with median size 3cm (3 - 4.5cm). No one had chemotherapy before surgery or within 90 days postoperatively. 80% of patients that had adjuvant hormonal therapy started it within 3 months of surgery. 17% had adjuvant external beam radiation. 7% (6/82) received antibiotics within 90 d post-operatively. All 6 presented with erythema at the incision site; 2 had serosanguinous drainage; and all had 0 of 4 SIRS. No cultures were taken. Four percent (2/82) had seroma drainage; 6% (3/82) complained of local pruritus; and 2% (1/82) had a minor wound separation. On univariate logistic regression, diabetes and adjuvant external beam radiation therapy trended towards significant association with post-operative antibiotic use (p = 0.05 & 0.08). No other factors associated with sub-acute post-operative complications, including age, race, menstrual status, tumor stage, histology, grade, receptor status, laterality, quadrant, number of foci, number of nodes excised or positive, number of re-excisions, time to surgery after diagnosis, time to hormonal therapy after surgery, or IORT treatment time or applicator size. Conclusion: Here we demonstrate in a single institution, retrospective study that women tolerate IORT well. The type and frequency of sub-acute post-operative complications compare well with those seen in surgery without IORT. Further review with a larger cohort and matched controls may help provide additional information about this relatively new therapeutic modality."
"Yamada, Y., et al.",1999,Does the dose fractionation schedule influence local control of adjuvant radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To explore the correlation between dose fractionation and local control for the adjuvant radiotherapy of early stage breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A matched-pair analysis of early stage invasive breast cancer treated adjuvantly with two different dose fractionation schedules, 4000 cGy in 16 fractions (Cohort A) vs. 5000 cGy in 25 fractions (Cohort B) was undertaken to compare local control rates. A systematic review of the published experience in similar patient populations was conducted and the reported dose fractionation schedule was converted to a biologic effect dose (BED) based upon the linear quadratic equation. The BED was then used as a basis for comparing reported local control rates with different dose fractionation schemes. Results: The 118 patient pairs were matched from Cohort A and Cohort B using known significant prognostic factors including age, histology, surgical margins, receptor status, lymphvascular space invasion, extensive intraductal disease, lymph node status, and systemic therapy. The local recurrence rate at 5 years for those treated with 4000 cGy (BED = 65 cGy4) and 5000 cGy (BED = 75 cGY4) was 12.7% and 6.8%, respectively, and this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Overall survival was 84% at 5 years for both groups. Comparison of the different dose fractionation schemes reported in the literature revealed a highly statistically significant difference between those treated with less than a BED of 75 Cy4 and those treated with a BED of 75 Gy4 or greater. Conclusion: Although not statistically significant, there was a trend in the matched pair analysis which suggests that 4000 cGy in 16 fractions (BED = 65 cGY4) provides inferior local control compared to 5000 cGy in 25 fractions (BED = 75 cGy4). Moreover, the literature review demonstrates that a dose control relationship may exist for local control in the adjuvant setting. A dose fractionation schedule equivalent to 5000 cGy in 25 fractions to the whole breast may represent the optimal dose fractionation schedule for local control."
"Yang, T. I. J., et al.",2010,Clinical Factors Associated With Seroma Volume Reduction in Breast-Conserving Therapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Multi-Institutional Analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose: To correlate clinical factors with seroma volume and reduction; and to determine whether cone-beam CT (CBCT) could be used clinically to monitor seroma reduction. Patients and Methods: This investigation included 102 women from five institutions with stage T1-2 breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Two CT scans were acquired: the planning CT (CT1) and a second CT (CT2) during radiotherapy (RT). Seroma was contoured on all scans, and correlations between seroma characteristics and clinical factors were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. In a substudy, 10 of the 102 patients received multiple CBCT scans during RT. Seroma were contoured by two observers in the substudy. Fifteen time points at which CT and CBCT were performed within 2 days were identified. The levels of correlation in seroma contours between CBCT and CT and between the two observers were examined. Results: The mean relative seroma reduction from CT1 to CT2 was 54% (p < 0.001). A significant inverse relationship was found between relative seroma reduction per week and number of RT fractions given by univariate and multivariate analyses (p = 0.01, 0.03). The mean difference in contoured seroma volumes between CT and CBCT was 12% (3.3 cm3). When assessing the relative difference in seroma contours between Observer 1 and Observer 2, an interobserver difference of 12% was demonstrated. Neither discrepancy was clinically significant. Conclusions: Radiotherapy seems to hinder seroma reduction. Volume discrepancies between CBCT and CT were minor, with low interobserver variation, indicating that CBCT might be useful in monitoring seroma reduction.  Inc. All rights reserved."
"Yang, Y. and M. J. Rivard",2013,Design of an internally shielded D-shaped breast brachytherapy applicator using monte carlo methods.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The applicators are designed to deliver boost dose to early stage breast cancer in replacement of conventional electron boost. The D-shaped applicators were able to provide more conformal target coverage with the flat edge positioned near the patient at the chest wall. By adding an internal shield, there is additional dose sparing to critical structures (such as skin, chest wall, and lung) with similar target coverage. The purpose of this study was to design and optimize the internal shield using Monte Carlo (MC) methods of radiation transport simulations. Materials/Methods: The D45 applicator served as the platform for MCguided design optimization and dose characterization. To protect tissue within 3 mm of the surface and to provide a clinical setup tolerance, the internal shield was focused 5 mm below the skin surface. Based on a preliminary study, a single focus technique caused hot spots at the D corners and complicated manufacturing. Thus, the line focus technique was developed to keep the internal shield for a similar D-shape radiation dose distribution at depths beyond 5 mm. The applicator height was also investigated to reduce treatment time. The 31NC, 31C, 25C, and 19C (Table Presented) applicators were simulated using the MCNP5 ∗F4mesh tally where 31, 25, and 19 indicate the applicator height (mm), and NC is no shield and C is with a shield. Dose was delivered using parallel-opposed beams and normalized to 1 Gy midway through the compressed breast on the applicator central axis for the 4 aforementioned applicators. Results: The maximum skin dose was reduced up to 15% and 27% for the 31C and 25C applicators, respectively, for a breast separation of 3 cm to 10 cm. For a pair of parallel-opposed beam, the 31C applicators increased treatment time by ∼5% while the 25C applicator reduced treatment time up to 12% in comparison to a 31NC applicator. The 19C applicator reduced treatment time by ∼21% while providing similar maximum skin dose as 31NC for breast thickness < 60 mm. The maximum skin dose and treatment time compared to the applicator without internal shield are summarized in Table. Conclusions: The internal shield with line focus significantly improved skin dose and reduced treatment times. However, DMAX was at ∼ 10 mm depth for the line focus technique compared to ∼ 5 mm for point focus."
"Yang, Z., et al.",2012,Simultaneous integrated boost in breast conserving radiation therapy: Is replanning necessary for seroma shrinkage?,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To explore whether replanning is beneficial following seroma reduction in breast conserving radiation therapy (RT) using the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with whole breast irradiation (WBI) and simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). Materials/Methods: Thirty early stage breast cancer patients treated by WBI plus sequential tumor bed (TB) boost after breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy seroma were consecutively selected for this study. In addition to the planning CT (CT1), repeat CT scans were acquired. A total of 84 CT scans (24 with 3 CTs (CT1 at one week before RT, CT2 after two weeks of RT and CT3 at the fifth week of RT) and 6 without CT3) were collected. TB and whole breast target volumes on all CTs were delineated and compared. WBI with SIB treatment plan using inversely IMRT with 50.68 Gy to the whole breast and 64.4 Gy to the boost in 28 fractions was generated for each patient on CT1. A hybrid plan and replanning were generated on the CT2. The hybrid plan was created by directly copying the original plan to CT2 without modifying the MLC positions, beam orientations and MUs. Replanning means a new WBI with SIB planning which was based on the re-contoured target volumes on the CT2. Replanning and hybrid plan were compared in terms of both target volume coverage and excess irradiation to the normal tissues. Results: The mean TB volumes for CT1, CT2, and CT3 were 42.1 cm3, 20.1 cm3, and 17.0 cm3, respectively. The mean TB reduction was 40.5% from CT1 to CT2 and 4.3% from CT2 to CT3. The difference of TB volumes between CT1 and CT2 was statistically significant (p < 0.001), but not significant between CT2 and CT3 (p = 1.000). For all patients, target coverage remained adequate with either hybrid plans or replannings. However, replanning could significantly decrease the whole breast mean dose (35.2 vs.35.6 Gy, p = 0.026) and breast tissue outside the boost receiving 95% of the boost prescribed dose (39.5 vs.68.2 cm3, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Although the boost volume could be adequately irradiated using initial planning even if the seroma reduction is significant in the course of WBI with SIB, replanning after two weeks of RT could avoid the undesired high dose irradiation to the breast volume outside the boost."
"Yang, Z., et al.",2016,Clinical results of phase 2 study of whole-breast irradiation with simultaneously integrated tumor bed boost (WBI-SIB): A single-center experience.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): To report the clinical result of phase II study of whole breast irradiation with simultaneously integrated tumor bed (TB) boost for early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: From October 2010 to April 2013, 200 patients with breast cancer who received breast conservative surgery were prospectively enrolled in this WBI-SIB study with inversely intensity modulated radiation therapy. The radiation therapy schema was 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the breast and an additional concurrent 0.6 Gy delivered to the TB. Acute breast skin toxicity was assessed according to the common terminology criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0 based on the highest grade toxicity. Cosmetic results were graded using 4-point scale according to the Harvard criteria by patient's self-assessment. Local control was calculated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Results: The median age for all patients was 45 year old. The mean breast PTV was 529.2cc and TB PTV was 92.9cc. The ipsilateral lung mean V20 was 17.2% and mean heart dose was 531cGy for left breast cancer. The acute skin toxicity was Grade 0 in 16 patients (8%), Grade 1 in 126 (63%) and Grade 2 in 58 (29%). Moist desquamation rate was 10.5% for all patients. In multivariate analysis, the predictive factors for grade 2 acute dermatitis were breast PTV ( P = 0.031) and TB PTV (P<0.001). In 185 cases, global breast cosmesis was judged as excellent or good in 87.1% and fair in 12.9%. Median follow-up time was 38 months, 2 patients had inbreast recurrence, and one patient has ipsilateral axillary lymph node and lung metastasis. Local control rate of 3 year was 98.7%. Conclusion: WBI-SIB for early stage breast cancer had good acute skin toxicity profile and cosmetic result in our hospital. The local control rate of 3 years was excellent. The WBI-SIB treatment scheme is feasible in Chinese patients."
"Yashar, C., et al.",2013,Outcomes for APBI with strut-based brachytherapy: 101 patients at 4.5 years median follow-up.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The SAVI Collaborative Research Group (SCRG), was created to study the long-term outcomes of women receiving accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using strut-based applicators. The outcomes for the most mature subgroup of this study's patients (n=101), accrued 3.5 to 6 years ago at 3 institutions, is presented. Materials/Methods: All patients were treated at least 42 months prior to abstract submission. Median follow-up of this cohort was 54 months. Patients were treated with APBI using the strut-based brachytherapy device with conventional dose and fractionation (3.4 Gy x 10 fx, BID). Treatment planning goals for the planning target volume were a V90 >90%, V150 <50 cc, and V200 <20 cc. Patients were followed regularly and outcome was graded based on the CTCAE v3.0 (common terminology criteria for adverse events, version 3.0). Results: Seventy-one patients had invasive disease and 29 had ductal carcinoma in situ. The median age was 62 years (range, 40-82 years), with 82% post-menopausal. Median tumor size was 12.5 mm (range, 2-35 mm) with 92% being estrogen receptor positive. All patients completed APBI as planned with no serious adverse events. All patients met the dosimetric criteria with median V90 of 96%, V150 of 29 cc and V200 of 14 cc. Late toxicity (grade ≥ 2) rates were low; hyperpigmentation (0%), telangiectasias (2%), seroma (2%), fat necrosis (0%) and breast asymmetry secondary to radiation effects (3%). Statistically, tumor size had a weak association with fibrosis (21.7 cc vs 12.5 cc, p=0.049) and surgical breast asymmetry (22 cc vs 12.7 cc, p=0.089). There were no statistical associations (p < 0.05) between treatment parameters and toxicity, possibly due to the low event rates (≥3%). Local control was excellent with a true recurrence/marginal miss rate of 2% and an ipsilateral/elsewhere recurrence rate of 2%. These data will be updated and presented for 5 year median follow-up in October 2013. Conclusions: For these 101 patients with a median 4.5 years of follow-up (all with >3.5 years), strut-based brachytherapy appears to be a welltolerated, effective treatment with low rates (<5%) of toxicities. With APBI an acceptable treatment for many women with early-stage breast cancer, strut-based brachytherapy continues on longer follow-up to be versatile, safe and effective."
"Yashar, C. M., et al.",2014,Outcomes for APBI with strut-based brachytherapy: First 200 accrued patients (52-month median follow-up).,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The SAVI Collaborative Research Group (SCRG) was created to study the long-term outcomes of women receiving accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using strut-based applicators. The outcomes for the first 200 accrued patients in the study (n = 200) are reported for all subjects, as well as stratified by DCIS or invasive histology. Materials/Methods: Patients for this subset analysis were taken as the initial 100 treated across all participating sites. Median follow-up of this cohort was 52.3 months at the time of the abstract. Patients were treated with APBI using the strut-based brachytherapy device with conventional dose and fractionation (3.4 Gy x 10 fx, BID). Treatment planning goals for the planning target volume were a V90 > 90%, V150 < 50 cc, and V200 < 20 cc. Patients were followed regularly by their radiation oncologists and outcome was graded based on the CTCAE v3.0 (common terminology criteria for adverse events, version 3.0). Recurrence (raw and actuarial) rates were also calculated based on the follow-up. Cosmesis was graded using the Harvard Scale. Results: 149 patients had invasive disease and 51 had ductal carcinoma in situ. The median age was 62.0 yrs (range 40-85 yrs), with 84% postmenopausal. Median tumor size was 10.5 mm (range 0.0-55 mm) with 88% being estrogen receptor positive. All patients completed APBI as planned with no serious adverse events. All patients met the dosimetric criteria. Late toxicity (grade ≥ 2) rates were low; telangiectasias (1.6%), seroma (3.2%) and fat necrosis (0.5%). Good/excellent cosmesis was seen in > 93% of subjects at all times of follow-up (6 months to 60 months). Local control was excellent with a true recurrence/marginal miss rates of 1.5% (n = 3), 1.4% (n = 2) and 2.0% (n = 1) for all subjects, invasive and DCIS subgroups, respectively. The ipsilateral/elsewhere recurrence rate was 1.0% (n = 1), 1.4% (n = 2) and 0% (n = 0) for all subjects, invasive and DCIS subgroups, respectively. The 4-yr actuarial rates for TR/ MM were 1.8%, 1.7%, and 2.1% for all subjects, invasive and DCIS subgroups, respectively. Conclusions: For these initially treated 200 patients with a median 52 months of follow-up, strut-based brachytherapy appears to be a welltolerated, effective treatment with low rates of toxicities. Local control rates are as good as those for other brachytherapy-based APBI techniques. With APBI an acceptable treatment for many women with early-stage breast cancer, strut-based brachytherapy continues to be versatile, safe, and effective."
"Yehia, Z. A., et al.",2019,APBI (Accelerated Partial-Breast Irradiation) Versus WBI (Whole-Breast Irradiation) Delivered with the Same Dose Fractionation: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis of Two Prospective Studied Cohorts.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The recent updates of the RAPID and RTOG 0413 trials have led to renewed interest in the question of APBI versus WBI outcomes. On the other hand, IMPORT-LOW, which was the only APBI randomized study strictly testing treatment volume without the confounding effect of dose-time factors, reported non-inferiority of APBI with fewer late toxicities. In this study, we report our institutional experience comparing two matched prospective cohorts of breast cancer patients treated with the same dose-fractionation using APBI or WBI. Materials/Methods: Two phase II trials using the same dose fractionation of 4995 cGy in 15 fractions enrolled early stage breast cancer patients at our institution between 2008 and 2017; one utilizing APBI and the other utilizing WBI. A total of 184 patients were enrolled in both trials (34 on the APBI and 150 on the WBI). Patients who received regional nodal irradiation or who were treated prone on the WBI trial were excluded. We then performed a propensity score 1:1 match between the two cohorts using age, histology, breast volume, and seroma volume. Outcomes of interest included loco-regional control, acute and late toxicity, and cosmesis. Cosmesis was scored using the Harvard Cosmesis Scale; toxicities were recorded using CTCAE version 4.03. Results: A total of 68 patients were matched. All patients had T1-T2, N0 disease with negative margins. Median follow up was 62.5 months [6-96] for the WBI patients versus 92.5 months [23-119] for the APBI patients. Median time to final cosmetic evaluation was 24.5 months [6-67] in the WBI cohort versus 90 months [9-119] in the APBI cohort. In accordance with the propensity score match, breast size mean (1400 cc vs 1600 cc; p =0.15), seroma size mean (37 cc vs 49 cc, p=0.27) and mean age (58 vs 60, p=0.17) were similar in the two groups. Ipsilateral breast recurrence rates were similar between the two groups (2/34, 5.9%) in the APBI versus (3/34, 8.8%) in the WBI, p= 1.0. In the WBI group, 1 patient had distant metastasis 6 years after treatment and 1 patient had a contralateral breast recurrence (CBR). In the APBI group, 4 patients had CBR. At final cosmetic evaluation, 91.2% in each cohort had excellent/good cosmesis, 5.9% in each cohort had fair cosmesis and 2.9% (1 patient in each cohort) had poor cosmesis, p = 0.92. In the WBI cohort, 11/34 patients had grade 2 or 3 acute toxicities (32.4%) versus 2/34 in the APBI group (5.9%), p= 0.01. In the WBI cohort, 12/34 patients had grade 2 or 3 late toxicities (35.3%) versus 7 in the APBI group (20.6%), p= 0.28. Conclusion: Clinical outcomes, toxicity profiles and cosmetic results were similar in patients treated with APBI or WBI, with significantly fewer grade 2–3 acute side effects after APBI. Our results are in agreement with the IMPORT-LOW outcomes and suggest that with similar fractionation schemes APBI and whole breast are associated with similar outcomes."
"Yoo, S., et al.",2013,"Comparison of preoperative partial breast radiosurgery treatment techniques: 3D-CRT, non-coplanar IMRT, coplanar IMRT, and VMAT.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Patients at our institution were enrolled on a phase I clinical protocol evaluating preoperative partial breast radiosurgery for early stage breast cancer. Treatment planning technique was not specified in the protocol. Therefore, we compared non-coplanar 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), non-coplanar intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRTNC), coplanar IMRT (IMRTCO) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in order to optimally determine the individualized treatment planning approach. Materials/Methods: As of July 2012, sixteen patients were enrolled in the breast radiosurgery study approved by IRB. CT and MR images were acquired in the prone position for each patient. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined based on fused CT and MR images. A 1.5 cm-margin and an additional 0.3 cm-margin from GTV were added to define the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV), respectively. Both CTVand PTV were modified to keep a minimum 5-mm distance from the skin surface. A 3 mm thick region along the ipsi-lateral breast surface was defined as skin to analyze dose to the subcutaneous tissue. Treatment plans used 6 MV photon beams. Gantry and couch angles were set to avoid the heart and contralateral breast. The single-fraction prescription dose was 15 Gy for the first eight patients and 18 Gy for the remaining patients. Four treatment plans with different delivery techniques were generated for each case. Dosimetric parameters for target coverage, maximum skin dose and normal breast tissue were compared between these four plans. Results: All plans were normalized to cover 95.1% of CTV with the prescribed dose (V100%=95.1%). The average homogeneity index (HI) was the smallest (1.05) for 3D-CRT and the largest (1.11) for VMAT. The average conformity index (CI) was the smallest (1.42) for IMRTNC and the largest (1.60) for VMAT. The average of maximum skin dose was the smallest (73.7%) for IMRTNC and the largest (86.5%) for 3D-CRT. IMRTCO showed very similar HI, CI, and maximum skin dose as IMRTNC (differences <1%). The differences in doses to the normal breast tissue were very small among plans (e.g., Differences in average V50% <1%). The average delivery time, excluding the time spent for patient positioning and imaging, was the shortest (7 minutes) for VMAT and the longest (11 minutes) for 3D-CRT. The average delivery times for IMRTNC and IMRTCO were 9.7 minutes and 8.3 minutes, respectively. Conclusions: For 3D-CRT, the standard for accelerated partial breast irradiation, yields high skin dose. VMAT offers short beam delivery time, but provides poor dose homogeneity and conformity. Noncoplanar IMRT or coplanar IMRT is the desired treatment technique for partial breast radiosurgery as IMRT plan can provide homogeneous and conformal target coverage as well as skin sparing with a short beam delivery time."
"Yoo, S., et al.",2014,Delivered dose for preoperative single fraction partial breast radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate patient positioning and investigate the impact of changes in breast shape on planned versus actual delivered dose for preoperative single fraction partial breast radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Thirty-two patients underwent preoperative single fraction partial breast radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer. A 0.3 cm margin was added from clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV). Patients were initially positioned using the skin marks placed at the time of planning CT simulation. The initial setup was corrected with on-line image-guidance using 2D kV images followed by 3D cone-beam CT (CBCT) prior to treatment. Post-treatment 2D or 3D images were acquired for all patients. The initial setup error was determined as the difference between the position based on skin markers and the position based on 2D kV images. The residual setup error was determined as the difference between 2D kV images and 3D CBCT. The intra-fractional motion was determined as the difference between pre-treatment and posttreatment images. Deformable registration was performed to register the planning CT to the pre-treatment CBCT retrospectively. The breast outlines from the deformed CT and CBCT were visually confirmed to be aligned after deformable registration. Dose was reconstructed based on the deformed planning CT to generate delivered plans. Delivered plans and original plans were compared. Results: The mean initial setup error, mean residual setup error, and mean intra-fractional motion were 1.00 ± 0.75 cm, 0.28 ± 0.42 cm and 0.21 ± 0.18 cm, respectively. The mean CTV volume receiving 95% of prescription dose (V95%) and PTV V95% were reduced by 0.9 ± 2.4% (p = 0.04) and 2.2 ± 3.9% (p < 0.01), respectively, in delivered plans compared to original plans. The differences in homogeneity index and conformity index were negligible. The mean dose to 10 cm3 (D10cm 3 ) and maximum dose (Dmax) for skin were greater in delivered plans than in original plans by 1.5 ±2.8% (p < 0.01) and 2.8 ± 8.0% (p = 0.06). Four patients had a planned skin Dmax higher than a suggested dose constraint based on previous studies (e.g., skin Dmax > 18 Gy). After accounting for breast deformation, only two more patients had a delivered skin Dmax exceeding 18 Gy. Other structures such as heart, lung, and breast showed non-significant dose differences (< 1%) between delivered plans and original plans. Conclusions: This study showed that a 0.3cm PTV margin was able to provide good CTVand PTV coverage (i.e., V95%) even after accounting for set up error, patient motion, and difference in breast shape with real-time IGRT. Breast deformation can result in a delivered skin dose greater than the planning dose. Because this may contribute to toxicity outcomes, the treatment plan should be carefully optimized to minimize dose to the skin."
"Yoo, S., et al.",2015,Dosimetric effect of the prone breast board and the couch top for whole-breast treatment in prone position.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recently published AAPM Task Group 176 guidelines recommend including immobilization devices and the couch top in dose calculations for accurate treatment planning. This study investigates the dosimetric effect of the prone breast board and couch top in dose calculations for whole breast radiation therapy in the prone position. Materials/Methods: This study included treatment plans from 14 patients with early stage breast cancer who were treated in the prone position. For each plan, two tangential beams were designed to encompass the contoured whole breast volume. Dose calculation was originally performed without the breast board and the couch top (POriginal). To study the effect of the breast board, each plan was retrospectively re-calculated with the external body including the breast board so that the actual CT numbers of the board could be used for dose calculation (PBoard=CT). Another plan was calculated with the board defined as a support device and a bulk CT number -800 HU assigned to the board (PBoard=-800HU). To study the effect of the couch top, POriginal was calculated again with the couch top inserted as a support (PCouch). The couch top model 'Exact IGRT couch top, thin' was used with -100 HU for panel surface and -1000 HU for panel interior. The board was not included in PCouch. Results: The mean volumes of the whole breast receiving 95% of the prescribed dose (V95%) were 96.2%, 95.2%, 95.5%, and 95.9% for POriginal, PBoard=CT, PBoard=-800HU, PCouch, respectively. The mean V100% of the whole breast were 84.4%, 78.2%, 79.5%, and 80.3% for POriginal, PBoard=CT, PBoard=-800HU, PCouch, respectively. Dose calculation results including the breast board with a bulk CT number of - 800HU are comparable to the method including the board with its actual CT numbers (mean diff= 0.2% for V95% and 1.3% for V100%). Conclusion: Including the breast board with either its actual CT numbers or a bulk CT number and the couch top model with bulk CT numbers improved dose calculation accuracy. Treatment plans without inclusion of the prone breast board and the couch top in dose calculations could underestimate the dose near the chest wall area and the breast tip area, respectively, for whole breast radiation therapy significantly."

This study investigates the effect of the breast board and couch top on dose calculations for whole breast radiation therapy in the prone position. Materials/Methods: This study included the treatment plans from 20 patients with early stage breast cancer who were treated in the prone position. For each plan, two tangential beams were designed to encompass the whole breast. Dose calculations were originally performed without the breast board and couch top (POrig) in the treatment planning system. To study the effect of the breast board, each plan was retrospectively recalculated with the external body including the breast board so that the actual CT numbers of the board could be used for dose calculation (PB). Another plan was calculated with the board defined as a support device and a bulk CT number -800 HU assigned to the board (PBZ-800HU). To study the effect of the couch top, POrig was calculated again with the couch top inserted as a support (PC). The couch top model 'Exact IGRT couch top, medium' was used with -100 HU for panel surface and -1000 HU for panel interior. The combined effect of the board and couch top, PB+C, was calculated with the external body including the breast board and the couch inserted as a support device. Volumes of the whole breast receive 98% and 100% of the prescribed dose (V98% and V100%, respectively) and equivalent uniform dose (EUD, with parameter a = -7.2) were compared. Results: The mean V98% were 92.7%, 91.3%, 91.7%, 90.4% and 89.1% for POrig PB, PBZ-800HU, PC, and PB+C respectively, while the mean V100% were 86.0%, 82.0%, 83.6%, 80.9% and 76.8%. The corresponding EUDs were 100.9%, 100.4%, 100.4%, 100.5%, and 100.1%, respectively. All P values were < 0.05 comparing each variation to POrig. Calculated doses including the breast board with a bulk CT number of e 800HU were comparable to the plan including the breast board with its actual CT numbers (mean diff = 0.4% for V98% and 1.6% for V100%). Differences between POrig and PB were, in general, small (mean diff = 1.4% for V98%; 3.9% for V100%; 0.5% for EUD), but statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Differences between POrig and PC were relatively large (mean diff = 2.3% for V98%; 5.1% for V100%), but driven by a small subset of patients. Conclusion: Including the breast board with either its actual CT numbers or a bulk CT number and the couch top with bulk CT numbers improved dose calculation accuracy. Dose calculation without inclusion of the prone breast board and the couch top could underestimate the dose, especially near the chest wall and the anterior portion of breast for whole breast radiation therapy."
"Yoo, S., et al.",2012,Partial breast extracranial radiosurgery: A dosimetric evaluation of treatment delivery accuracy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Partial breast extra-cranial radiosurgery was proposed to treat early stage breast cancer patient preoperatively. Conebeam CT (CBCT) acquired prior to treatment represents the actual patient position during the treatment. This study evaluates dosimetric variations between the delivered plan (DP) based on CBCTand the original plan (OP) based on the planning CT. Materials/Methods: Seven patients treated to 15 Gy in the prone position were included in this study. The gross tumor volume (GTV) (volume: 0.5 cc to 2.7 cc) was defined based on fused CT and breast MR images. The clinical target volume (CTV) encompassed the GTV + a 1.5-cm isotropic margin. An additional 0.3-cm isotropic margin was added to form the planning target volume (PTV). Both CTV and PTV excluded the outermost 0.5 cm of the patient surface. A 3 mm thick region along the ipsilateral breast surface was defined as skin to analyze dose to the subcutaneous tissue. Four to five non-coplanar photon beams were arranged to avoid heart, lungs and contralateral breast and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) provided further optimization. The plans were normalized to deliver 100% of the prescription to at least 95% of the CTV. For treatment, target localization was achieved based on both skin surface and soft-tissue tumor and/or biopsy markers using CBCT. To standardize the CBCT images, the CT numbers were assigned - breast to -122 HU, lungs to -719 HU, and all others to 40 HU. The GTV, CTV, and PTV were copied to CBCT based on the target localization while the skin, breasts, and lungs were manually contoured. The delivered dose distribution was re-calculated on the CBCT. Dosimetric parameters of OP and DP were compared. Results: The average CTV receiving 100% of the prescription (V100%) was 95.5% ± 0.4 vs 93.2% ± 5.7 (OP vs. DP). The difference in V100% between OP and DP was > 10% for 2 patients (DP ≤ OP). However, the difference in V96% between OP and DP was < 1% for all 7 patients. The average maximum dose to skin was 76.7% ± 13.9 vs. 77.4% ± 11.7. The difference in maximum skin dose between OP and DP was > 8% for 3 patients (DP ≥ OP for 2 patients and ≤ OP for 1 patient). The lung V5Gy was ≤ 1% for all patients in both OP and DP. The contralateral breast V1Gy was 8.1% vs 12.9% for 1 patient, 6 patients had V1Gy < 1% in both OP and DP. The heart V5Gy was zero in OP for all patients, and it was not delineated in CBCT due to difficulties with image quality. Conclusions: Partial breast radiosurgery in this cohort was delivered with a high level of accuracy to the target coverage (CTV V96% achieved for all patients within 1%). Similarly, doses to critical organs were essentially as planned. However, small differences in skin doses were seen due to the effect of set-up variation on breast shape."
"Young, R., et al.",2012,A retrospective study evaluating toxicity in women with dcis undergoing hypofractionated adjuvant radiation therapy after breast conserving surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Traditional fractionation for whole breast radiation after breast-conserving surgery has been 50 Gy in 25 fractions over a 5-week period, with or without a 10 Gy boost to the lumpectomy cavity. Hypofractionation has been adapted for early-stage invasive breast cancer, typically treating with 42.5 Gy in 16 daily fractions. This approach has been shown to have equivalent efficacy as the traditional schedule. Its application to patients with DCIS has been an extrapolation of these data, and warrants further examination. This retrospective analysis reviews toxicity outcomes in women with DCIS treated with hypofractionation at our institution. Materials/Methods: Fifty-nine women with DCIS treated with lumpectomy and hypofractionated radiation therapy with or without boost between 2006 and 2010 were identified. Charts were reviewed retrospectively to assess toxicity during treatment and in short-term follow up. Median age was 69 (39-85). Median follow-up was 15 months (2-64). Surgical margin status was negative in 55, positive in 1, and unknown in 3 patients. Thirteen patients had high-grade, 17 intermediate-grade, and 13 low-grade nuclear features, while 16 did not have a grade delineation. Receptor status was: ER/ PR+ in 71.1% of patients (n=42); ER+/PR- in 8.5% (n=5); ER/PR- Her- 2-neu+ in 3.4% (n = 2); ER+/PR-, Her-2-neu+ in 1 woman; ER-/PR+ in 1 woman; triple negative status in 10.2% (n = 6) women; and unknown receptor status in 3.4% (n=2) of the patients. All women were treated with whole-breast hypofractionated therapy (42.4 Gy, in 16 fractions of 2.65 Gy each). Forty-nine women received a boost to the lumpectomy cavity consisting of either 10 Gy in 5 fractions or 9.6 Gy in 4 fractions at the physician's discretion. Thirty-three (56%) of women were treated in the prone position, and 26 (44%) were treated in the supine position. Results: No patients experienced acute RTOG toxicity above a Grade 2 on this regimen. No treatment breaks were required due to toxicity. The most common side effects were Grade 1 dermatitis (documented in 98% of the patients, n = 58), followed by Grade 2 dermatitis (documented in 10.2%, n = 6). The most common Grade 1 finding included mild erythema and hyperpigmentation, and the most common Grade 2 finding was moderate edema. A higher percentage of patients with Grade 2 dermatitis were treated in the prone vs. supine position (n = 4 vs n = 2, respectively), but the majority of women treated prone (87.9%, n = 29) had only Grade 1 skin toxicity. There were no in-breast recurrences among this group of patients at this point in our follow-up. Conclusions: Our results suggest that postoperative hypofractionated radiation to the breast is well tolerated by women with DCIS and does not result in untoward acute toxicity. Further follow-up is required to assess late toxicity."
"Yu, E., et al.",2016,Analysis of acute and late outcomes using hypofractionated tumor bed boost following hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology,"Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) confers equal local control and cosmesis as compared to standard-fractionated treatment. Trials using hypofractionated WBI did not utilize a tumor bed (TB) boost, or utilized one with standard fractionation. We performed a retrospective analysis to determine acute and late outcomes following hypofractionated WBI and boost. Materials/Methods: We examined records of patients treated with hypofractionated WBI and hypofractionated TB boost after lumpectomy for stage 0-II breast cancer. Local control, toxicity, and cosmetic outcome were evaluated. Acute skin toxicity was scored according to RTOG criteria, late toxicity 1 month after radiation therapy (RT), according to CTCAE v.4.03, and cosmetic outcome, based on the Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were evaluated including excision volume, surgical technique and complications, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy administration, and RT dose, fractionation, and technique. Univariate analyses were performed with chisquared tests using analytics software. Results: One hundred sixty-six patients received hypofractionated WBI and boost from 2010 and 2015. Median follow-up was 15 months (1 e 62 mos). Median age was 65 years (44 e 91 yrs). Patient stage was 0, I, and II in 23.5%, 67.5%, and 9.0%, respectively. Median tumor size was 1.2 cm (0.2 e 7.8 cm). Median initial excision volume was 65.2cm3 (15.1 e 962.9 cm3). 17% had oncoplastic closures. 14% had re-excision for positive margins. Postoperative complications included 21.1% palpable seroma, 2.4% wound infection, and 1.2% hematoma. 10% received chemotherapy, and 64%, endocrine therapy. All patients received hypofractionated WBI with 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions (fx). Median TB boost fractional dose was 266 cGy (240 e 266 cGy) and median number of boost fx was 3 (2e4 fx). 64% received 266 cGy/fx for 3 fx. TB boost was given via en face electrons, high dose-rate non-invasive breast brachytherapy (NIBB), electrons and NIBB, and mini-tangents in 64.5%, 21.1%, 12.7%, and 1.2%, respectively. Acute skin reaction was grade 1 in 60.8% and grade 2 in 32.5%. Moist desquamation developed in 7.2%. No treatment breaks for acute toxicity were needed. Late toxicities included 19.3% postsurgery/radiation volume loss, 3.6% breast edema, 1.2% telangiectasia, 1.8% symptomatic fat necrosis, and 0.6% arm lymphedema. 15% experienced subcutaneous fibrosis; 13.2%, 1.2%, and 0.6% were grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 93.4% achieved good/excellent cosmesis. There were no local recurrences. Postoperative complications (relative risk 3.2, P<0.01) correlated with late toxicity, but not closure type, excision volume, reexcision, boost technique/dose/fractionation. No factors correlated with poor cosmesis. Conclusion: Hypofractionated TB boost is well-tolerated with a low rate of toxicity and high rate of good-to-excellent cosmesis. When boost is planned as part of hypofractionated WBI, a hypofractionated boost should be considered."
"Yu, J., et al.",2015,Small arc volumetric modulated arc therapy: A new approach superior to IMRT in optimizing dosimetric and treatment relevant parameters for patients following breast conservative surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) is considered to deliver a better dose distribution and shorten treatment time. There is lack of studies regarding breast irradiation after breast conservative surgery by VMAT in prone position. We set up a new approach of small arc VMAT innovatively and compared it to the conventional fixed field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the dosimetric and treatment relevant parameters for breast cancer patients in prone position. Materials/Methods: Ten breast cancer patients in early stage were included in this exploratory study. Patients all underwent Big Bore Computed Tomography (CT) simulation scan in prone position and each patient was given IMRT and VMAT plans simultaneously by Monaco planning system. Two symmetrical partial arc fields were applied in VMAT plans. The angle range of the two arcs were set on average 80°- 150° and 210°-260° respectively, mini-adjusting by the volume of targets, aiming at minimizing the dose exposure of lung and heart. Comparatively, tangential IMRT plan was designed by 4-5 fields. Prescription doses were 50 Gy/25F/2.0 Gy. Target coverage, homogeneity, conformity, dose, and volume of OAR (organ at risk), treatment time, monitor unit, and segments number were evaluated respectively. Differences were analyzed by paired samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: Higher median conformal index (CI) and lower homogeneity index (HI) of PTV were observed in VMAT plans group (CI, 95% vs 91%; HI, 1.06 vs 1.09; (p<0.001). Within VMAT plans, the mean volume of ipsilateral lung V30, V20, V10, V5 reduced to 10%, 14.9%, 25.9%, 44.9% (p<0.01), mean lung dose shift from 10.5 ±1.8 Gy to 9.6 ±1.4 Gy (p=0.001). Meanwhile, volume of heart receiving 30 Gy and 40 Gy were similar between the two techniques (p > 0.1). In addition, VMAT plans reduced median treatment time (161seconds vs 412seconds p<0.001) and mean monitor unit (713 vs 878; p < 0.001) compared with IMRT plans. Conclusion: Small arc volumetric modulated arc therapy can improve conformal index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) of target, spare the dose of lung and reduce treatment time and monitor unit, compared to IMRT. It is a more promising technique for breast cancer patients following breast conservative surgery. (Table Presented)."
"Yue, Y., et al.",2017,Sel1l stratifies the prognosis of breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): We hypothesize that gene signatures with multiple SNPs play active roles in promoting disease progression and response to therapy. This study aims to use genomic mutation and signaling pathway information to identify breast cancer gene signatures associated with sensitivity to radiotherapy (RT). Purpose/Objective(s): We performed analysis on the breast cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, a large cohort of genetic data from dbGaP of NCBI. The dataset includes genotyping 528,173 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,145 European women with invasive breast cancer and 1,142 controls, and 3,233 pathways integrated from multiple public sources, including KEGG, panther, cell map, and BioCarta. A novel semiparametric model for gene and pathway level analysis using genetic data was developed. With this method, we identified gene signatures associated with sensitivity to RT using a multi-institutional test cohort consisting of 343 patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and postoperative RT (GSE30682). Results: Functional enrichment analysis suggested that 52 genes are associated with breast cancer cellular biological processes (FDR <0.001, Bonferroni correction). Among them, the SEL1L gene has 16 variations significantly associated with survival. In the cohort treated with RT, patients with high expression of SEL1L have significantly better local recurrence than those with low expression (P = 0.003, log-rank). For patients treated with higher total dose (>66 Gy), those with high SEL1L expression (n = 78) had a significantly better prognosis than those with low SEL1L (n = 22, P = 0.003). In the patients treated with less dose (<=66 Gy), high SEL1L patients (n = 165) still have better outcome than the low SEL1L expressing patients (n = 77), however, at marginal significance (P = 0.08). The results suggest that SEL1L is prone to have multiple SNPs variations, and patients with SEL1L overexpression may have increased radiosensitivity. Conclusion: This study indicates that multiple-SNPs and pathway analysis is an effective approach to identify gene signatures which are sensitive to patient treatment outcome. SEL1L mutations and expressions may confer increased radiosensitivity in breast cancer patients, and result in improved clinical results after treatment with RT."
"Yusoff, S., et al.",2012,Bilateral breast and regional nodal irradiation in early stage breast cancer D a dosimetric comparison of IMRT and 3D conformal radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Recent trials have shown benefits of regional nodal irradiation. Our study aims to compare dosimetric outcomes in women with bilateral early stage breast cancer undergoing bilateral breast and regional nodal irradiation using standard 3 dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) versus intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after breast conserving surgery. Materials/Methods: Volumes were delineated on 10 patients as per MA20 protocol. The 3DCRT technique involved bilateral tangential fields, anterior posterior supraclavicular fossa and axillary fields and an anterior internal mammary chain (IMC) electron photon mix field; IMRT technique involved 12 multi-field coplanar inverse planning. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose-volume histogram statistics, dose homogeneity and conformity index were analyzed. Results: IMRT was superior to 3DCRT with significant improvements in reducing the volume of heart in the high dose region V40 (3DCRT:16.0% versus IMRT: 2.6%; p < 0.05) and achieving lower mean lung dose (MLD) (3DCRT:21.4 Gy versus IMRT: 17.9 Gy; p < 0.05). However, these improvements came with significant higher integral dose to the lungs V5 (3DCRT:60.7% versus IMRT: 99.6%; p < 0.05). Both techniques covered the planned target volume (PTV) adequately with no significant differences in PTV dose homogeneity (3DCRT:0.25; IMRT: 0.19; p=0.49) and conformity index (3DCRT:0.92; IMRT: 0.96; p = 0.21). Conclusions: IMRT provided significant reduction in the high dose heart volume and MLD. Long-term follow-up would be required to determine if higher integral lung dose translates into clinical significant second malignancy rates given the excellent long-term survival in these patients."
"Zaenger, D., et al.",2017,The influence of histologic grade on outcomes of elderly women with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery with or without radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Two large randomized trials, CALGB 9343 and PRIME II, support omission of radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (BCS) in elderly women with favorable-risk early stage breast cancer intending to take endocrine therapy. However, patients with grade 3 (G3) histology were underrepresented on these trials. We hypothesized that high-grade disease may be unsuitable for treatment de-escalation and report the oncologic outcomes for elderly women with favorable early stage breast cancer treated with BCS with or without radiotherapy. Purpose/Objective(s): The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried for women between 70-79 years of age with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) diagnosed between 1998 and 2007. This cohort was narrowed to women with stage I (T1mic-T1c, N0), ER+ IDC treated with BCS with or without external beam radiation (EBRT). The primary endpoints were 5-and 10-year cause-specific survival (CSS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Propensity-score matching (PSM) of T-stage, year of diagnosis, and age was utilized to reduce selection bias while comparing treatment arms within the G3 subgroup. Results: 12036 women met inclusion criteria with a median follow-up was 9.4 years. EBRT was omitted in 22% of patients, including 21% with G3 disease. Patients in the EBRT cohort were slightly younger (median 74 vs. 75 yrs, p<0.01) and had fewer T1a tumors (11 vs. 13%, p=0.02). Histologic grades 1, 2, and 3 comprised 36%, 50%, and 14% of the cohort, respectively, and there were no differences in EBRT utilization by grade. Utilization of EBRT decreased following the publication of the CALGB trial in 2004 decreasing from 82-85% in 1998-2000 to 73-75% in 2005-2007 (p<0.01). In grade 1 disease there were no differences in CSS with or without EBRT at 5 (99%) and 10 years (95-96%). EBRT was associated with a modest improvement in CSS in grade 2 histology at 5 years (97% vs. 98%) and 10 years (92% vs. 95%) (p=0.004). The benefit was more pronounced in grade 3 disease with CSS increasing from 93 to 96% at 5 years and from 87% to 92% at 10 years (p=0.02) with EBRT. In the G3 subgroup, PSM confirmed EBRT was associated with superior CSS compared to surgery alone (hazard ratio 0.58 [95% confidence interval 0.34-0.98], p = 0.043). Conclusion: In this database analysis, omission of radiotherapy after BCS in elderly women with favorable-risk, early stage, grade 3 breast cancer was associated with inferior CSS. Further prospective data in this patient population are needed to confirm our findings and conclusions."
"Zagar, T. M., et al.",2011,Dosimetric comparison of radiotherapy for left sided breast cancer: Breath-hold versus free breathing.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Radiotherapy for left sided breast cancer potentially increases risk for late toxicity to the heart. The simple technique of breath-hold (BH) can be instituted in an attempt to reduce volume of lung and heart irradiated in tangential fields.We report on patients with left sided breast cancer that were planned both with conventional free-breathing (FB) and BH radiation techniques from a single institution. Materials/Methods: From 10/2006 to 5/2010, 27 patients with node-negative, early stage breast cancer underwent CT simulation for left sided breast cancer and were selected for analysis in this report. FB and BH CT scans were obtained and treatment plans using opposed tangential fields were created to compare various dosimetric indices. Results: BH plans resulted in lower doses to the heart (max dose 2273 vs. 4560cGy, p<0.0001; mean dose 175 vs. 296cGy, p = 0.0019; V25 0 vs. 1.8%, p<0.0001; volume in tangential field 0 vs. 10.11cc p = 0.0001) compared to FB. The ipsilateral lung received lower doses but a larger volume of lung was encompassed in the tangential fields (V20 13.3 vs. 20.3%, p<0.0001; mean dose 741 vs. 1025cGy, p = 0.0001; volume in tangential field 257 vs. 199cc p<0.0001) compared to FB. Conclusions: Treatment of early stage left sided breast cancer with BH technique is a simple method for minimizing cardiac and ipsilateral lung dose. Long term follow-up is necessary to demonstrate if these dosimetric differences translate into clinically meaningful differences."
"Zeidan, Y., et al.",2019,Post Mastectomy Radiation Therapy in HER2/neu Positive Breast Cancer: Analysis of the HERA trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) has been shown in multiple clinical trials to improve local control, distant metastases and overall survival in breast cancer patients. However, it remains unclear whether these findings can be applied to HER-2/neu positive patients in the modern era. Materials/Methods: The HERA trial (BIG 1-01) is a phase 3 randomized clinical trial that established the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in HER-2 positive early stage breast cancer. The current study was performed on 1633 trial subjects treated with mastectomy who received adjuvant trastuzumab. The primary goal of the study was to determine the effect of PMRT on loco-regional recurrence (LRR). Hazard ratios were estimated from Cox models and LRR curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Our analysis included 940 patients (57.6%) who received PMRT and 693 patients (42.4%) who did not. Patients in the PMRT group received radiation to the chest wall and regional lymphatics. At a median follow up of 11 years, no significant difference in LRR was noted after PMRT in node negative (N0) patients (HR = 1.0 (0.33-2.98), p-value = 0.99). However, patients with N1 disease (1-3 positive lymph nodes) had a LRR of 2.8% in the PMRT group as compared to 9.7% in the no-PMRT group (HR = 0.29 (0.12-0.66), p-value = 0.003). No significant differences in OS were observed according to receipt of PMRT. Conclusion: PMRT delivery in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive nodes decreases the risk of LRR. However, the magnitude of PMRT benefit is lower than historical studies. Future randomized trials are needed to assess the role of PMRT in HER-2/neu positive breast cancer patients."
"Zellars, R., et al.",2011,"Phase I/II trial of partial breast irradiation with concurrent dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (DDAC) chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer: Late assessment of toxicity, Cosmetic outcome, and disease recurrence.",International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Anthracyclines and concurrent whole breast radiation result in prohibitive cutaneous toxicity (40% grade 4 radiation dermatitis-Fiets et al., Eur J Cancer, 2003). With the advent of partial breast irradiation (PBI), we hypothesized that anthracycline-based chemotherapy and concurrent breast irradiation may now be feasible. Potential benefits of concurrent chemoradiation include: shorter duration of overall therapy, greater efficacy from the delivery of therapy closer to surgery, and better local control via the radiation sensitizing effects of chemotherapy. Thus we conducted a single arm feasibility trial of PBI with concurrent chemotherapy. We previously reported that early toxicity was minimal (Zellars JCO 2009). We now describe the late skin and subcutaneous tissue toxicity, cosmetic outcome, and rate of recurrence. Materials/Methods: Women with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer with ≥3 mm lumpectomy margins received PBI (40.5 Gy in 15 daily 2.7 Gy fractions) concurrently with the first 2 of 4 cycles of ddAC (60 and 600 mg/m2 respectively, every 14 days with colony-stimulating factor support). Additional, systemic therapy after ddAC was at the physician's discretion. Late skin/soft tissue toxicities were graded by the treating team according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events manual (v. 3.0). A panel of 7 physicians/nurses, who were not part of the treatment team, graded cosmetic outcome using a modified Harvard cosmetic scale (digital images of the ipsilateral, post-surgical breast, before XRT, serve as reference). Results: Twenty-seven patients enrolled between Nov 2004-Jan 2007 and 24 are evaluable (2 withdrew consent and 1 developed metastatic disease prior to therapy). Median tumor size was 1.8 cm (range 0.4 -3.0cm), 62% were pN0, and 50% received Taxol after ddAC. After median f/u of 58 months (range 39-78), there have been no locoregional or distant recurrences. Observed rate of ≥ grade 3 late skin or subcutaneous tissue toxicities was 0%. Cosmetic outcome was scored as good/excellent, fair and poor in 92% (22), 4% (1) and 4% (1) of patients, respectively. The single patient with a poor cosmetic outcome had fibrosis at the lumpectomy site without skin changes. Conclusions: Our study showed that PBI with concurrent ddAC is feasible with respect to late toxicity and cosmetic outcome. No patient has ≥ grade 3 late skin/subcutaneous tissue toxicity. Most had good/excellent cosmetic outcome and there have been no recurrences. This concept must now be tested in larger controlled studies."
"Zhang, L., et al.",2014,Dose coverage of axillary levels i-iii and the sentinel lymph node area with inverse-planned intensity modulated radiation therapy in patients with breast-conserving surgery.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Data from ACOSOG Z0011 trial and IBCSG trial 23-01 suggested that sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy could be sufficient for patients with limited number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes for early stage breast cancer. One of the possible reasons was that the low rate of axillary recurrence was attributed to the axilla dose coverage during whole breast irradiation. This study attempted to evaluate the incidental radiation doses to axillary levels I-III and the sentinel lymph node (SLN) area by whole breast irradiation with multi-field inverse-planned intensity modulated radiation therapy in early stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 40 patients with early stage breast cancer treated in our cancer center in 2008-2012. All patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node dissection by a senior experienced surgeon, meanwhile a clip was placed to mark the area of SLN. Whole breast irradiation with multi-field inverse-planned intensity modulated radiation therapy was applied in the patients. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The axillary levels I-III were delineated according to the RTOG, and the SLN CTV was defined as 2 cm in diameter around the clip. Dose-volume parameters were used to calculate the dose distribution of these lymph node areas. Results: The mean dose delivered to axillary levels I, II, III are 33.0 ± 7.5 Gy, 17.9 Gy ± 11.3 Gy, 7.3 Gy ± 6.6 Gy, respectively. The percent of volume received 95% of the prescribed dose of axillary levels I, II, III were 29.9%± 17.7%, 9.0%±14.5%, 0.1%±0.3%, respectively. All SLNs were located in axillary level I area, the mean dose received by the SLN area was 43.0±10.0 Gy. The percent of volume received 95% of the prescribed dose was 51.9±36.2%. Fifty-eight percent of SLN received a dose greater than 45 Gy. Conclusions: The multi-field inverse-planned intensity modulated radiation therapy technique offer limited dose coverage to axillary levels I-III in patients receiving whole breast irradiation. The mean dose received by SLN is 43 Gy, which should not be omitted. For those patients with SLN micrometastases and no axillary lymph node dissection, the dose contributed by breast irradiation may be sufficient to eliminate the subclinical lesion of low axillary area. (Table Presented)."
"Zhang, L., et al.",2014,Dose distribution analysis of the sentinel lymph node area during field-in-field forward-planned intensity modulated radiation therapy to breast.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The role of axillary radiation for patients with micrometastatic sentinel lymph node (SLN) in early stage breast cancer remained controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze dose distribution of sentinel lymph node area during field-in-field forward-planned intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to breast in early stage breast cancer patients with breast-conservative surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Materials/Methods: From May 2009 to February 2013, we retrospectively analyzed 39 early stage breast cancer patients with 50 clips positioned at the site of the SLN during surgery by a senior experienced surgeon in our cancer center. All patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and SLN biopsy followed by whole breast irradiation with field-in-field forwardplanned IMRT technique. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The SLN CTV was defined as 2 cm in diameter around the clip with the lateral border not exceeding 0.5 cm under skin. Dose volume histograms (DVH) of the SLN area were calculated to assess the mean dose and the dose received by 95%, 90%, and 80% of SLN volume. The relationship between the SLN area and the radiation fields was also studied. Results: The mean dose delivered to SLN area was 42.6±11.7 Gy. Sixty-two percent SLN areas had a mean dose greater than 45.0 Gy, only 10% SLN areas received a mean dose less than 30.0 Gy. The percent of volume received 95%, 90%, 80% of the prescribed dose were 64.2±38.2%, 70.0±35.3%, 83.8±27.6%, respectively. All SLN areas were contained within axillary level I area. Thirty-two of 50 SLN volumes were located within the radiation fields, no SLN volumes fell completely out of the radiation fields. Of the remaining 18 SLN volumes that were partially covered by the radiation fields, 14 SLN volumes overlapped the superior border. Conclusions: Using whole breast irradiation with field-in-field forwardplanned IMRT technique, the SLN area received a considerable amount of dose coverage. The majority of SLN volumes were located within radiation fields. For the purpose of prophylactic radiation therapy of the area of axilla, such as for patients with SLN micrometastases and no axillary lymph node dissection, the routine field-in-field forward-planned IMRT technique is adequate and sufficient."
"Zhang, L., et al.",2015,Intraoperative radiation therapy versus whole-breast external beam radiation therapy in early-stage breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) was demonstrated a promising technique for early stage breast cancer patients. However, there were still a lot of controversies. The aim of this metaanalysis was to summarize available evidence that compared the efficacy and safety of IORT with whole-breast external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for women with early stage breast cancer and breast conserving surgery. Materials/Methods: We searched the database of MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, and Cochrane Library through October 2014. Studies that compared IORT with whole-breast EBRT were selected. IORT was defined as a single dose irradiation to the tumor bed at surgery that substituted whole breast irradiation but not a tumor bed boost. Two authors independently conducted the literature selection and data abstraction. The RRs of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, overall mortality, breast cancer mortality, non-breast cancer mortality, and distant metastasis were pooled using a random-effects model. Results: Four studies with 5415 patients were included in this analysis, including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two non-RCTs. There was significant overall heterogeneity for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (I2=58.5%, P=0.065). The pooled RR of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for IORT versus whole-breast EBRT was 2.83 (95% CI: 1.23-6.51). The pooled RR for overall mortality, breast cancer mortality, non-breast cancer mortality and distant metastasis were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.66-1.17), 1.20 (95% CI: 0.77-1.86), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.44-1.31), 0.95 (95% CI: 0.61-1.49), respectively. Conclusion: Current evidence indicated that IORT should be used under careful selection of suitable patients. Identifying women with low risk of local recurrence was very important."
"Zhang, Y., et al.",2019,Carbon Fiducial Image Guidance Increases the Accuracy of Lumpectomy Cavity Localization in Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer.,Practical Radiation Oncology,"Purpose: We investigated the feasibility and accuracy of using carbon fiducials to localize the lumpectomy cavity with 2-dimensional kV imaging for early stage breast cancer radiation therapy. Methods and Materials: Carbon fiducials were placed intraoperatively in the periphery of the lumpectomy cavity. Nine patients received whole breast irradiation with a boost, and 2 patients received 3-dimensional conformal partial breast irradiation. A total of 89 fractions were assessed for setup errors relative to a predefined gold standard, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) match to the lumpectomy cavity, using the following 4 setup methods: (1) Align skin tattoos with lasers; (2) match bone with 2-dimensional–2-dimensional (2D/2D) kV onboard imaging (OBI); (3) match the whole breast with CBCT; and (4) match carbon fiducials with 2D/2D kV OBI. The margin for the planning target volume (PTV) was calculated by 2 standard deviations of the setup errors, and compared among the 4 setup methods. Setup errors for patients treated with free breathing and patients with deep inspiration breath hold were also compared. Results: The carbon fiducials were sufficiently visible on OBI for matching and introduced minimal artifacts. Of the 4 alignment methods, 2D/2D OBI match to fiducials resulted in the smallest setup errors. The PTV margin was 12 mm for aligning skin tattoos using lasers, 9.2 mm for matching bone on OBI, 6.5 mm for matching breast on CBCT, and 3.5 mm for matching fiducials on 2D/2D OBI. Compared with free breathing, deep inspiration breath hold generally reduced the standard deviations of the setup errors, but further investigation would be needed. Conclusions: Matching to carbon fiducials increased the localization accuracy to the lumpectomy cavity. This reduces residual setup error and PTV margins, facilitating tissue sparing without diminishing treatment efficacy."
"Zhao, B., et al.",2013,Assessment of breast motion during hypofractionated robotic radiation therapy.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Accounting for intrafraction motion is a critical element of breast radiation therapy to determine the treatment margin during partial breast irradiation and to reduce the toxicity to nearby critical structures such as heart, lung and ribs. Breast motion can be monitored using various methodologies, including optical or infrared tracking of individual markers placed on a patient's surface and 3D-video based optical surface imaging. Several institutions including our own have also employed implanted fiducial tracking using stereoscopic x-ray imaging on a robotic linac, using a module specifically designed to compensate for respiration induced tumor motion. The real-time tumor motion is predicted continuously based on a model that correlates external markers to internal fiducials. The purpose of this study is to analyze breast motion traces and report the characteristics of breast motion during robotic stereotactic treatment. Materials/Methods: Breast cancer patients are currently enrolled in a prospective phase I clinical trial: Phase I Partial Breast Irradiation for Early Stage Breast Cancer, with a dose scheme of 27.5-35 Gy delivered in 5 fractions. Each patient has 3-5 gold fiducials implanted in the involved breast in preparation for robotic treatment. Each treatment lasts approximately 50 minutes, and the real-time motion data is analyzed using the log files saved during treatment. The log file contains the modeled 3D tumor motion data continuously tracked with 25 fps. Motion from 20 breast patients who were treated successfully was retrospectively studied, and the amplitudes were calculated as the difference of neighboring peaks and troughs. Results: Treatment time excluding initial setup averaged 44.0 ± 14.2 mins. Throughout the treatment course, most patients exhibited small respiratory amplitudes below 5 mm. The range of motion was smallest in the RL direction and maximal in the SI direction. Average amplitudes across all patients were 1.04 ± 0.85 mm (SI), 0.30 ± 0.33 mm (RL) and 0.86 ± 0.70 mm (AP). One patient exhibited relatively large motion amplitudes of 3.06 ± 1.75 mm (SI), 0.41 ± 0.36 mm (RL) and 2.46 ± 1.44 mm (AP); 16% of the 2049 total retrieved amplitudes for this patient were over 5 mm. The amplitudes of the five fractions averaged from all patients were 0.92 ± 0.72 mm, 0.99 ± 0.62 mm, 1.14 ± 0.91 mm, 0.98 ± 0.82 mm, 1.18 ± 1.10 mm in SI direction. Conclusions: In this study, respiratory motion in breast cancer patients treated with a hypofractionated approach was generally less than 5 mm. The interfraction motion pattern is relatively reproducible based on SI amplitude statistics. While we used real time motion tracking to treat patients, this study provides information about appropriate expansions for target motion using systems without real time correction."
"Zhao, B., et al.",2014,Comparison of deep inspiration breath hold left breast tangents with active breath hold and voluntary breath hold using 3D surface image guidance.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) may be used to reduce heart dose during radiation therapy for left breast cancer. This study compared two techniques of DIBH, active breath hold (ABH) and voluntary breath hold (VBH) using surface imaging guidance on their effectiveness and efficiency in DIBH treatment. Materials/Methods: Twenty patients, 10 in each technique, with early stage left breast cancer treated with tangent whole breast irradiation were retrospectively studied. VBH patients were the first ten treated using this technique while ABH had been used for a longer period of time. During CT simulation each patient underwent DIBH CTs, which were used to generate treatment plans. For reference purposes, free breathing (FB) simulation CTs were also acquired. Each patient had 3-6 weekly portal films through the course of treatment. We then retrospectively generated plans on FB CTs using the same dose criteria on PTVs Daily fraction dose for thewhole breast was 180-200cGy for 18 patients and 266 cGy for 2 patients, one in eachDIBHtechnique. Field in field was employed to increase dose uniformity. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery dose and the heart dose were evaluated. Heart position was evaluated on pretreatment verification films at breath hold. Treatment timewas estimated as the difference of time stamps at initial set up and end of treatment, as recorded in record and verification system. Only days without portal films were analyzed. Results: Both methods significantly reduced heart and LAD dose. The maximum LAD dose decreased by 89.6% ± 50.0% with ABH and 76.4% ± 55.5% with VBH. Decrease in mean heart dose and V30Gy was 66.5% ± 34.0% and 180.0% ± 40.0%, respectively with ABH, and 53.1% ± 25.0% and 171.9% ± 48.6%, respectively with VBH. Orthogonal setup film review from VBH patients showed that heart position deviation is small for most patients. The average heart position displacement was 0.1 ± 2.0 mm (S-I), 1.4 ± 3.1 mm (R-L), and 0.3 ± 1.9 mm (A-P). Comparable data for ABH patients is under study. Portal verification films confirmed the heart was effectively excluded from the treatment fields for all patients in both techniques. The treatment time was shorter with ABH (8.3 ± 6.0 mins) than VBH (13.8 ± 4.0 mins). All VBH patients tolerated voluntary breath hold for the entire treatment course. 2 ABH patients were unable to tolerate breath hold and were replanned and treated with free breathing. Conclusions: Both DIBH techniques effectively spared the heart during irradiation, with comparable reduction in heart dose. The differences in treatment time between the two techniques may be due in part to therapist familiarity with the technique, and may not be clinically significant with continued experience."
"Zhao, X., et al.",2013,Acute radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): A dosimetric analysis.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): The use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) when treating the whole breast has been shown to have a significant decrease in the rate of radiation induced moist desquamation during treatment. IMRT has been shown to have improved dosimetric parameters when compared to existing dosimetric information and guidelines developed using conventional conformal techniques. The purpose of this study is to determine if IMRT specific dosimetric guidelines that limit the volume of breast tissue receiving above the prescribed dose reduce acute skin toxicity. Material/Methods: The study population consisted of 54 female patients with early stage breast cancer who were treated with whole breast adjuvant radiation therapy after undergoing surgery using conventional fractionation and sequential electron boost. Treatment plans were created using forward planned IMRT with conventional tangent fields, with either a field-in-field or fluence surface compensation technique. Dosimetric comparisons were conducted and the primary end-point was acute skin toxicity (notably moist desquamation). Statistical comparisons between groups were done using two-sample t-tests. Results: The incidence of radiation induced moist desquamation was 38.9% across 54 patients. Higher values of V105%, V107% and total breast volume were all associated with a significant increase in risk of radiation induced moist desquamation. For V105% >20% (n=25), the rate of moist desquamation was 56.0% compared to 24.1% for V105% <20% (p=.016; RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1 e 4.8). For V107% >5% (n = 28), the rate of moist desquamation was 57.1% compared to 19.2% for V107% <5% (p = .004; RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3 e 6.9). Larger breast size (PTV >1200 cm3; n=21) was an independent predictor of an increase in breast desquamation (p = .001; RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5 e 6.5). On subset analysis, in women with larger breast size, both the impact of V107% >5% (p = .004; RR, 3.4) and the impact of V105% >20% (p=.026; RR, 2.8) was significant. In women with smaller breast size, no significant difference was observed for the impact of V105% (p = .78; RR, 1.2) or V107% (p = .28; RR, 2). Conclusions: When treating the whole breast with forward planned IMRT, limiting the volume of breast tissue receiving greater than 105% and 107% of the prescribed dose is associated with a decrease in radiation-induced moist desquamation. Institutional guidelines such as keeping V105% below 20% and V107% below 5% may benefit in ensuring that women are not exposed to an unnecessary risk of acute skin toxicity. The importance is especially evident in the women with larger breasts; intensive efforts should be made to lower the volume of tissue receiving greater than 105% and 107% of the prescribed dose."
"Zoberi, I., et al.",2017,Evaluation of single fraction high-gradient partial breast irradiation as the sole method of radiation therapy for low-risk stage 0 and i breast cancer-early results of a single institution prospective clinical trial.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"Purpose/Objective(s): To test the hypothesis that a single fraction of external beam radiotherapy to breast tissue one centimeter around a partial mastectomy cavity will result in acceptable ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates, tolerance, and cosmesis in select women with low-risk early stage breast cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Postmenopausal women undergoing breast conserving surgery for breast cancers less than or equal to 2 cm in size were enrolled in a single institution prospective clinical trial. Patients had to be at least 50 years old and have estrogen receptor positive cancers without her2/neu gene amplification. Radiotherapy was administered with MR-guided teletherapy except in cases were MR was contraindicated in the outpatient setting within 8 weeks of surgery. Surgical margins were required to be negative by at least 2 mm. A dose of 20 Gy was prescribed to a planning target volume (PTV) defined as the surgical cavity truncated as least 5 mm from the skin surface while simultaneously prescribing a dose of 7 Gy to the surface of a PTV defined as a 1 cm expansion of the surgical cavity in breast tissue truncated 5 mm from the skin surface. The resulting high-gradient treatment was administered in a single fraction as the sole radiotherapy treatment. Results: To date 19 of a planned total fifty women have been treated. The mean age was 64 years. Three patients had pTisN0, 10 pT1bN0, and 6 pT1cN0 disease. MR-guided teletherapy via Cobalt-60 was used in all but one patient who had a pacemaker. With a mean and median follow up time of 10.3 and 10 months from diagnosis there have been no breast cancer recurrences and no intercurrent deaths. No patient has been lost to follow up. All toxicities have been grade 1 with six patients having skin hyperpigmentation in the treatment region and three having transient breast pain. Cosmesis has remained excellent in all patients. Conclusion: Early results of our trial demonstrate that a single fraction of high-gradient radiotherapy is well tolerated. Continued enrollment and follow up is needed to determine cancer control outcomes."
"Zwicker, R. D., et al.",1985,Planning of Ir-192 seed implants for boost irradiation to the breast.,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"The conservative management of early stage breast cancer with tumor excision and irradiation of the breast is becoming increasingly accepted as an alternative to modified radical mastectomy. The radiotherapy typically consists of 45 to 50 Gy delivered with external beam irradiation, followed by boost irradiation of 15 to 20 Gy to the tumor bed using electron beams or interstitial implantation. Pathological evaluation of the excised tumor, clinical assessment, and mammography are used to determine the tissue volume potentially containing a residual tumor burden and therefore requiring boost irradiation. In this paper we describe planning and implantation procedures for Quimby-type breast implants using Ir-192 seeds encapsulated in nylon tubing. This system deviates in several important respects from the requirements of the standard brachytherapy systems. For double-plane implants, optimized values of the interplanar spacing are given for a range of implant sizes, along with the corresponding target dose rates for 1.0 mCi seeds. We also describe a modification of the angiocatheter implantation technique, which allows the radioactive sources to be secured in place by a magnetic cap and washer, thus greatly facilitating the removal of the sources at the end of treatment."
