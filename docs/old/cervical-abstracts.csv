2020,Lancet,Mortality impact of achieving WHO cervical cancer elimination targets: a comparative modelling analysis in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries.,"WHO is developing a global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem, which proposes an elimination threshold of four cases per 100 000 women and includes 2030 triple-intervention coverage targets for scale-up of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to 90%, twice-lifetime cervical screening to 70%, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer to 90%. We assessed the impact of achieving the 90-70-90 triple-intervention targets on cervical cancer mortality and deaths averted over the next century. We also assessed the potential for the elimination initiative to support target 3.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-a one-third reduction in premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by 2030.The WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC) involves three independent, dynamic models of HPV infection, cervical carcinogenesis, screening, and precancer and invasive cancer treatment. Reductions in age-standardised rates of cervical cancer mortality in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) were estimated for three core scenarios: girls-only vaccination at age 9 years with catch-up for girls aged 10-14 years; girls-only vaccination plus once-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up; and girls-only vaccination plus twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment scale-up. Vaccination was assumed to provide 100% lifetime protection against infections with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and to scale up to 90% coverage in 2020. Cervical screening involved HPV testing at age 35 years, or at ages 35 years and 45 years, with scale-up to 45% coverage by 2023, 70% by 2030, and 90% by 2045, and we assumed that 50% of women with invasive cervical cancer would receive appropriate surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by 2023, which would increase to 90% by 2030. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.In 2020, the estimated cervical cancer mortality rate across all 78 LMICs was 13·2 (range 12·9-14·1) per 100 000 women. Compared to the status quo, by 2030, vaccination alone would have minimal impact on cervical cancer mortality, leading to a 0·1% (0·1-0·5) reduction, but additionally scaling up twice-lifetime screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 34·2% (23·3-37·8), averting 300 000 (300 000-400 000) deaths by 2030 (with similar results for once-lifetime screening). By 2070, scaling up vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 61·7% (61·4-66·1), averting 4·8 million (4·1-4·8) deaths. By 2070, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 88·9% (84·0-89·3), averting 13·3 million (13·1-13·6) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 92·3% (88·4-93·0), averting 14·6 million (14·1-14·6) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). By 2120, vaccination alone would reduce mortality by 89·5% (86·6-89·9), averting 45·8 million (44·7-46·4) deaths. By 2120, additionally scaling up screening and cancer treatment would reduce mortality by 97·9% (95·0-98·0), averting 60·8 million (60·2-61·2) deaths (with once-lifetime screening), or by 98·6% (96·5-98·6), averting 62·6 million (62·1-62·8) deaths (with twice-lifetime screening). With the WHO triple-intervention strategy, over the next 10 years, about half (48% [45-55]) of deaths averted would be in sub-Saharan Africa and almost a third (32% [29-34]) would be in South Asia; over the next 100 years, almost 90% of deaths averted would be in these regions. For premature deaths (age 30-69 years), the WHO triple-intervention strategy would result in rate reductions of 33·9% (24·4-37·9) by 2030, 96·2% (94·3-96·8) by 2070, and 98·6% (96·9-98·8) by 2120.These findings emphasise the importance of acting immediately on three fronts to scale up vaccination, screening, and treatment for pre-invasive and invasive cervical cancer. In the next 10 years, a one-third reduction in the rate of premature mortality from cervical cancer in LMICs is possible, contributing to the realisation of the 2030 UN SDGs. Over the next century, successful implementation of the WHO elimination strategy would reduce cervical cancer mortality by almost 99% and save more than 62 million women's lives.WHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Germany Federal Ministry of Health, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Compute Canada, and Fonds de recherche du Québec-Santé.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

2020,Lancet,Impact of HPV vaccination and cervical screening on cervical cancer elimination: a comparative modelling analysis in 78 low-income and lower-middle-income countries.,"The WHO Director-General has issued a call for action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. To help inform global efforts, we modelled potential human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening scenarios in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) to examine the feasibility and timing of elimination at different thresholds, and to estimate the number of cervical cancer cases averted on the path to elimination.The WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Modelling Consortium (CCEMC), which consists of three independent transmission-dynamic models identified by WHO according to predefined criteria, projected reductions in cervical cancer incidence over time in 78 LMICs for three standardised base-case scenarios: girls-only vaccination; girls-only vaccination and once-lifetime screening; and girls-only vaccination and twice-lifetime screening. Girls were vaccinated at age 9 years (with a catch-up to age 14 years), assuming 90% coverage and 100% lifetime protection against HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Cervical screening involved HPV testing once or twice per lifetime at ages 35 years and 45 years, with uptake increasing from 45% (2023) to 90% (2045 onwards). The elimination thresholds examined were an average age-standardised cervical cancer incidence of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years and ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and an 85% or greater reduction in incidence. Sensitivity analyses were done, varying vaccination and screening strategies and assumptions. We summarised results using the median (range) of model predictions.Girls-only HPV vaccination was predicted to reduce the median age-standardised cervical cancer incidence in LMICs from 19·8 (range 19·4-19·8) to 2·1 (2·0-2·6) cases per 100 000 women-years over the next century (89·4% [86·2-90·1] reduction), and to avert 61·0 million (60·5-63·0) cases during this period. Adding twice-lifetime screening reduced the incidence to 0·7 (0·6-1·6) cases per 100 000 women-years (96·7% [91·3-96·7] reduction) and averted an extra 12·1 million (9·5-13·7) cases. Girls-only vaccination was predicted to result in elimination in 60% (58-65) of LMICs based on the threshold of four or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, in 99% (89-100) of LMICs based on the threshold of ten or fewer cases per 100 000 women-years, and in 87% (37-99) of LMICs based on the 85% or greater reduction threshold. When adding twice-lifetime screening, 100% (71-100) of LMICs reached elimination for all three thresholds. In regions in which all countries can achieve cervical cancer elimination with girls-only vaccination, elimination could occur between 2059 and 2102, depending on the threshold and region. Introducing twice-lifetime screening accelerated elimination by 11-31 years. Long-term vaccine protection was required for elimination.Predictions were consistent across our three models and suggest that high HPV vaccination coverage of girls can lead to cervical cancer elimination in most LMICs by the end of the century. Screening with high uptake will expedite reductions and will be necessary to eliminate cervical cancer in countries with the highest burden.WHO, UNDP, UN Population Fund, UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Program of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Canadian Institute of Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec-Santé, Compute Canada, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia Centre for Research Excellence in Cervical Cancer Control.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

2019,Pract Radiat Oncol,Associations of Early Medicaid Expansion With Insurance Status and Stage at Diagnosis Among Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy.,"Medicaid expansion in 2014 is associated with improved insurance coverage and stage at diagnosis in cancer patients. However, little is known about the effect of early Medicaid expansions in 2010 to 2011 on outcomes in radiation therapy recipients. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of early Medicaid expansion on insurance status and stage at diagnosis among radiation therapy recipients.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for cases aged 18 to 64 diagnosed in 2007 to 2013 with a first primary malignancy treated with radiation therapy. Difference-in-differences analyses were used to compare changes in insurance coverage and stage at diagnosis from 2007 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013 in expansion relative to nonexpansion states.There was a -0.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.84 to -0.13; P = .007) percentage point (PP) reduction in uninsured in expansion relative to nonexpansion states, primarily among counties with lower educational attainment (-1.73 PP; 95% CI, -2.72 to -0.75). Increases in early stage diagnoses in expansion relative to nonexpansion states were found overall and in breast (1.56 PP; 95% CI, 0.45-2.68; P = .006), colorectal (3.72 PP; 95% CI, 0.33-7.12; P = .032), and lung (1.49 PP; 95% CI, 0.25-2.72; P = .018) cancers. Decreases in late stage diagnoses were found in cervical (-5.91 PP; 95% CI, -9.58 to -2.25; P = .002), colorectal (-2.72 PP; 95% CI, -5.43 to -0.01; P = .05), and lung (-3.28 PP; 95% CI, -5.47 to -1.1; P = .003) cancers.For radiation therapy recipients, early Medicaid expansion was associated with decreased percent uninsured, particularly among low education counties, and earlier stage diagnoses for screenable cancers. Thus, early Medicaid expansion may improve access to care and decrease disparities for radiation therapy recipients.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

2019,Lancet,Population-level impact and herd effects following the introduction of human papillomavirus vaccination programmes: updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"More than 10 years have elapsed since human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was implemented. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination.In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks.We identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5-8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% (RR 0·17, 95% CI 0·11-0·25) among girls aged 13-19 years, and decreased significantly by 66% (RR 0·34, 95% CI 0·23-0·49) among women aged 20-24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0·33-0·66) among girls aged 13-19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67% (RR 0·33, 95% CI 0·24-0·46) among girls aged 15-19 years, decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0·46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60) among women aged 20-24 years, and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·53-0·89) among women aged 25-29 years. Among boys aged 15-19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48% (RR 0·52, 95% CI 0·37-0·75) and among men aged 20-24 years they decreased significantly by 32% (RR 0·68, 95% CI 0·47-0·98). After 5-9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51% (RR 0·49, 95% CI 0·42-0·58) among screened girls aged 15-19 years and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·57-0·84) among women aged 20-24 years.This updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men. Additionally, programmes with multi-cohort vaccination and high vaccination coverage had a greater direct impact and herd effects.WHO, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

2019,Pract Radiat Oncol,Appropriate Methodology for EBRT and HDR Intracavitary/Interstitial Brachytherapy Dose Composite and Clinical Plan Evaluation for Patients With Cervical Cancer.,"This study assessed the appropriateness of full parameter addition (FPA) methods with respect to the 3-dimensional deformable dose composite method for evaluating combined external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT).A total of 22 patients who received EBRT and high-dose-rate ICBT were retrospectively evaluated. Split-ring and tandem applicators were used for all patients. Additional interstitial needles were used for 5 patients to supplement the implant. Deformable image registrations were performed to deform the secondary EBRT and ICBT planning computed tomography (CT) images onto the reference CT from the third fraction of ICBT. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to evaluate the quality of deformable registration. Doses were transferred to the reference CT, scaled to the equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions and combined to create the dose composite. Eight dose-accumulation methods were evaluated and compared. D2cc and D0.1cc for organs at risk were investigated.The differences in D2cc for rectum, bladder, sigmoid, and bowel between the FPA method for whole-pelvis EBRT and ICBT, calculated using an old American Brachytherapy Society worksheet (FPA_Eh + I_old) and deformable composite for EBRT with boosts and ICBT (Def_E + B + I) were -2.19 ± 1.37 Gyα/β = 3, -0.64 ± 1.13 Gyα/β = 3, -2.06 ± 2.71 Gyα/β = 3, and -1.59 ± 0.89 Gyα/β = 3, respectively. The differences in D2cc for rectum, bladder, sigmoid, and bowel between the new ABS worksheet (FPA_Eh + B + I_abs) and the Def_E + B + I method were 1.21 ± 1.22 Gy α/β = 3, 1.93 ± 1.38 Gyα/β = 3, 0.72 ± 1.12 Gyα/β = 3, and 1.19 ± 1.46 Gyα/β = 3, respectively. Differences in dose-volume histogram parameter values among Def_E + B + I and other FPA methods were not statistically significant (P > .05).Compared with the FPA-based method, deformable registration-based dose composites demonstrated lower OAR D2cc and D0.1cc values; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The current ABS-recommended FPA-based sheet can serve as an acceptable plan evaluation tool for clinical purposes.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Radiation Oncology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2019,Lancet,Cervical cancer.,"Each year, more than half a million women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and the disease results in over 300 000 deaths worldwide. High-risk subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) are the cause of the disease in most cases. The disease is largely preventable. Approximately 90% of cervical cancers occur in low-income and middle-income countries that lack organised screening and HPV vaccination programmes. In high-income countries, cervical cancer incidence and mortality have more than halved over the past 30 years since the introduction of formal screening programmes. Treatment depends on disease extent at diagnosis and locally available resources, and might involve radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation, or a combination of both. Conservative, fertility-preserving surgical procedures have become standard of care for women with low-risk, early-stage disease. Advances in radiotherapy technology, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, have resulted in less treatment-related toxicity for women with locally-advanced disease. For women with metastatic or recurrent disease, the overall prognosis remains poor; nevertheless, the incorporation of the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab has been able to extend overall survival beyond 12 months. Preliminary results of novel immunotherapeutic approaches, similarly to other solid tumours, have shown promising results so far.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA
2019,Pract Radiat Oncol,Is SBRT Boost Feasible for PET Positive Lymph Nodes for Cervical Cancer? Evaluation using Tumor Control Probability and QUANTEC Criteria.,"This study aimed to examine the feasibility of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as an external beam radiation therapy boost to positron emission tomography (PET) positive lymph nodes (LN) in patients with cervical cancer and to evaluate overall tumor control probability (TCP) increase.Ten patients with cervical cancer and PET positive LN metastasis who received external beam radiation therapy (45 Gy), followed by a 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy boost (5.4-9 Gy) and tandem-and-ovoid high-dose-rate brachytherapy (16-30 Gy) were retrospectively enrolled in this study. SBRT plans were generated using 21 Gy, 24 Gy, or 30 Gy as a replacement for 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy boost. The 2 Gy-per-fraction equivalent dose maps were made using an α/β value of 10 for PET positive LNs and 3 for organs at risk (OARs). TCP values were calculated using a logistic TCP model, where 2 input parameters (D50 and Gamma50 = 2) were modeled by 2 clinical outcomes: our institution and the literature. OAR sparing was evaluated using Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) dose limits.Thirty percent of 10 patients receiving conventional boost experienced recurrence. The TCP of the SBRT schemes was 88% ± 7% (97% ± 2%; 21 Gy), 96% ± 1% (99% ± 0%; 24 Gy), and 99% ± 1% (100% ± 0%; 30 Gy), and the conventional LN-boost TCP value was 25% ± 11% (58% ± 15%) when TCP input parameters were based on published clinical outcome data for LN SBRT treatments (institutional outcome data). The tumor coverage doses (D90) of the SBRT boost plans were on average 32.34 Gyαβ=10 (21 Gy), 37.78 Gyαβ=10 (24 Gy), and 55.54Gyαβ=10 (30 Gy) higher than the conventional LN boost plan. The QUANTEC OAR dose constraints were met for the bladder, rectum, and bowel in all cases for the SBRT LN 21 Gy group, and in 90% and 70% of cases in the SBRT LN 24 Gy and SBRT LN 30 Gy groups, respectively.An SBRT boost dose of 30 Gy can be delivered without compromising QUANTEC OAR limits. The use of SBRT increases TCP values, regardless of the input parameters.Published by Elsevier Inc.",NA
2019,Pract Radiat Oncol,Less Than Whole Uterus Irradiation for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Maintains Locoregional Control and Decreases Radiation Dose to Bowel.,"This study aimed to evaluate whether our institutional standard of less-than-whole-uterus irradiation affects locoregional control in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.We retrospectively reviewed 53 patients with stage IB to IVB cervical carcinoma who were treated with image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy. The entire uterus was not included in the clinical target volume, as per our institutional standard. Dosimetric parameters were obtained, including positron emission tomography gross tumor volume (GTV), uterus volume excluding GTV, proportion of uterus included in the planning target volume (PTV; percentage), volume of overlap between uterus and prescription dose (cm3), minimum and mean dose to the uterus, and bowel V40 and D200cc. Local, regional, and distant failure and death were recorded.The median proportion of the uterus included in the PTV was 66%. With a median follow-up of 44 months, no patient experienced isolated local recurrence, and 2-year locoregional failure was 10.9%. Positron emission tomography GTV correlated significantly with increased chance of any failure (P = .049; 95% confidence interval, 1.000-1.018). Compared with patients who had ≥90% of the uterus included in the PTV (n = 12), patients who had <90% (n = 41) of the uterus included in the PTV had significantly lower bowel V40 (P = .049) and D200cc (P = .006).Less-than-whole-uterus irradiation for locally advanced cervical cancer does not compromise locoregional control and reduces bowel V40 and D200cc. Further investigation is required to evaluate whether this reduction in bowel dose translates to a clinically significant reduction in bowel toxicity and whether modifications should be made to the recommended definitive cervix intensity modulated radiation therapy volumes.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

2019,Pract Radiat Oncol,Patterns of Recurrence in Node-Positive Cervical Cancer Patients Treated With Contemporary Chemoradiation and Dose Escalation: A Multi-Institutional Study.,"We assessed the effect of elective extended field radiation (EFRT) and nodal dose escalation on locoregional control and survival in patients with node-positive cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation at 2 academic institutions.Patients with cervical cancer with pelvic and/or paraortic lymph node (PALN) metastases treated with definitive chemoradiation between 2004 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Patterns of failure were recorded. The impact of tumor and treatment on survival or recurrence were evaluated.A total of 78 patients were included. Median follow-up in surviving patients was 34 months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 65% and 50%, respectively (all patients), 68% and 52% (pelvic lymph nodes), and 59% and 48% (PALN). OS or DFS in pelvic-only versus PALN-positive patients was not significantly different (log-rank P = .24). Recurrences were distant (n = 22), PALN (n = 6), central pelvis (n = 5), pelvic lymph node (n = 3), and suspended ovary (n = 1). Higher nodal prescribed dose (range, 45-60 Gy) and elective EFRT did not affect DFS or OS (Cox proportional hazards P > .05). There was a trend toward decreased regional recurrence with higher nodal dose (hazard ratio, 0.85 per Gy increase; Cox proportional hazards P = .08). Elective EFRT did not affect PALN failure rate, OS, or DFS (Cox proportional hazards P > .05).Survival of patients with PALN involvement was similar to those with pelvic-only nodes. Higher nodal dose may improve regional control but did not affect survival. Elective extended-field radiation did not affect outcomes in this cohort. Most failures were distant, emphasizing the potential role of systemic therapy to improve outcomes.Published by Elsevier Inc.",NA
2017,Lancet,"Final efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety analyses of a nine-valent human papillomavirus vaccine in women aged 16-26 years: a randomised, double-blind trial.","Primary analyses of a study in young women aged 16-26 years showed efficacy of the nine-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV; HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) vaccine against infections and disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and non-inferior HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 antibody responses when compared with quadrivalent HPV (qHPV; HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine. We aimed to report efficacy of the 9vHPV vaccine for up to 6 years following first administration and antibody responses over 5 years.We undertook this randomised, double-blind, efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety study of the 9vHPV vaccine study at 105 study sites in 18 countries. Women aged 16-26 years old who were healthy, with no history of abnormal cervical cytology, no previous abnormal cervical biopsy results, and no more than four lifetime sexual partners were randomly assigned (1:1) by central randomisation and block sizes of 2 and 2 to receive three intramuscular injections over 6 months of 9vHPV or qHPV (control) vaccine. All participants, study investigators, and study site personnel, laboratory staff, members of the sponsor's study team, and members of the adjudication pathology panel were masked to vaccination groups. The primary outcomes were incidence of high-grade cervical disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, invasive cervical carcinoma), vulvar disease (vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3, vulvar cancer), and vaginal disease (vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3, vaginal cancer) related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 and non-inferiority (excluding a decrease of 1·5 times) of anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 geometric mean titres (GMT). Tissue samples were adjudicated for histopathology diagnosis and tested for HPV DNA. Serum antibody responses were assessed by competitive Luminex immunoassay. The primary evaluation of efficacy was a superiority analysis in the per-protocol efficacy population, supportive efficacy was analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, and the primary evaluation of immunogenicity was a non-inferiority analysis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00543543.Between Sept 26, 2007, and Dec 18, 2009, we recruited and randomly assigned 14 215 participants to receive 9vHPV (n=7106) or qHPV (n=7109) vaccine. In the per-protocol population, the incidence of high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 was 0·5 cases per 10 000 person-years in the 9vHPV and 19·0 cases per 10 000 person-years in the qHPV groups, representing 97·4% efficacy (95% CI 85·0-99·9). HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs were non-inferior in the 9vHPV versus qHPV group from month 1 to 3 years after vaccination. No clinically meaningful differences in serious adverse events were noted between the study groups. 11 participants died during the study follow-up period (six in the 9vHPV vaccine group and five in the qHPV vaccine group); none of the deaths were considered vaccine-related.The 9vHPV vaccine prevents infection, cytological abnormalities, high-grade lesions, and cervical procedures related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Both the 9vHPV vaccine and qHPV vaccine had a similar immunogenicity profile with respect to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Vaccine efficacy was sustained for up to 6 years. The 9vHPV vaccine could potentially provide broader coverage and prevent 90% of cervical cancer cases worldwide.Merck & Co, Inc.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA
2017,Lancet,"Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (Gynecologic Oncology Group 240).","On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial. In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events.In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain. Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease. Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible. We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m2 on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2 on day 1) or topotecan (0·75 mg/m2 on days 1-3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response. We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic). We gave treatment open label. Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062.Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups). By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis. The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16·8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13·3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·62-0·95]; p=0·007). Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24·5 months versus 16·8 months (0·64 [0·37-1·10]; p=0·11). Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8·4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7·1 months; 0·83 [0·66-1·05]; p=0·06). Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated). Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (<1%). No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death.The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated. After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped). These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer.National Cancer Institute.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2017,Lancet,The global burden of women's cancers: a grand challenge in global health.,"Every year, more than 2 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, yet where a woman lives, her socioeconomic status, and agency largely determines whether she will develop one of these cancers and will ultimately survive. In regions with scarce resources, fragile or fragmented health systems, cancer contributes to the cycle of poverty. Proven and cost-effective interventions are available for both these common cancers, yet for so many women access to these is beyond reach. These inequities highlight the urgent need in low-income and middle-income countries for sustainable investments in the entire continuum of cancer control, from prevention to palliative care, and in the development of high-quality population-based cancer registries. In this first paper of the Series on health, equity, and women's cancers, we describe the burden of breast and cervical cancer, with an emphasis on global and regional trends in incidence, mortality, and survival, and the consequences, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged women in different settings.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2017,Lancet,"Changing global policy to deliver safe, equitable, and affordable care for women's cancers.","Breast and cervical cancer are major threats to the health of women globally, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Radical progress to close the global cancer divide for women requires not only evidence-based policy making, but also broad multisectoral collaboration that capitalises on recent progress in the associated domains of women's health and innovative public health approaches to cancer care and control. Such multisectoral collaboration can serve to build health systems for cancer, and more broadly for primary care, surgery, and pathology. This Series paper explores the global health and public policy landscapes that intersect with women's health and global cancer control, with new approaches to bringing policy to action. Cancer is a major global social and political priority, and women's cancers are not only a tractable socioeconomic policy target in themselves, but also an important Trojan horse to drive improved cancer control and care.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2017,Lancet,Interventions to close the divide for women with breast and cervical cancer between low-income and middle-income countries and high-income countries.,"Breast and cervical cancers are the commonest cancers diagnosed in women living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where opportunities for prevention, early detection, or both, are few. Yet several cost-effective interventions could be used to reduce the burden of these two cancers in resource-limited environments. Population- wide vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) linked to cervical screening, at least once, for adult women has the potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer substantially. Strategies such as visual inspection with acetic acid and testing for oncogenic HPV types could make prevention of cervical cancer programmatically feasible. These two cancers need not be viewed as inevitably fatal, and can be cured, particularly if detected and treated at an early stage. Investing in the health of girls and women is an investment in the development of nations and their futures. Here we explore ways to lessen the divide between LMICs and high-income countries for breast and cervical cancers.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA
2016,Lancet,"Rituximab and dose-dense chemotherapy for adults with Burkitt's lymphoma: a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.","Short intensive chemotherapy is the standard of care for adult patients with Burkitt's leukaemia or lymphoma. Findings from single-arm studies suggest that addition of rituximab to these regimens could improve patient outcomes. Our objective was to test this possibility in a randomised trial.In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients older than 18 years with untreated HIV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma (including Burkitt's leukaemia) from 45 haematological centres in France. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to any drug included in the chemotherapy regimens, any serious comorbidity, poor renal (creatinine concentration >150 μmol/L) or hepatic (cirrhosis or previous hepatitis B or C) function, pregnancy, and any history of cancer except for non-melanoma skin tumours or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma. Patients were stratified into two groups based on disease extension (absence [group B] or presence [group C] of bone marrow or central nervous system involvement). Patients were further stratified in group C according to age (<40 years, 40-60 years, and >60 years) and central nervous system involvement. Participants were randomly assigned in each group to either intravenous rituximab injections and chemotherapy (lymphome malin B [LMB]) or chemotherapy alone by the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte datacentre. Randomisation was stratified by treatment group and centre using computer-assisted permuted-block randomisation (block size of four; allocation ratio 1:1). We gave rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and day 6 during the first two courses of chemotherapy (total of four infusions). The primary endpoint is 3 year event-free survival (EFS). We analysed all patients who had data available according to their originally assigned group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00180882.Between Oct 14, 2004, and Sept 7, 2010, we randomly allocated 260 patients to rituximab or no rituximab (group B 124 patients [64 no rituximab; 60 rituximab]; group C 136 patients [66 no rituximab; 70 rituximab]). With a median follow-up of 38 months (IQR 24-59), patients in the rituximab group achieved better 3 year EFS (75% [95% CI 66-82]) than did those in the no rituximab group (62% [53-70]; log-rank p stratified by treatment group=0·024). The hazard ratio estimated with a Cox model stratified by treatment group, assuming proportionality, was 0·59 for EFS (95% CI 0·38-0·94; p=0·025). Adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The most common adverse events were infectious (grade 3-4 in 137 [17%] treatment cycles in the rituximab group vs 115 [15%] in the no rituximab group) and haematological (mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 3·31 days per cycle [95% CI 3·01-3·61] vs 3·38 days per cycle [3·05-3·70]) events.Addition of rituximab to a short intensive chemotherapy programme improves EFS in adults with Burkitt's leukaemia or lymphoma.Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Roche, Chugai, Sanofi.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2016,Lancet,Antiangiogenic therapy in oncology: current status and future directions.,"Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, has been validated as a target in several tumour types through randomised trials, incorporating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors into the therapeutic armoury. Although some tumours such as renal cell carcinoma, ovarian and cervical cancers, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours are sensitive to these drugs, others such as prostate cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and melanoma are resistant. Even when drugs have yielded significant results, improvements in progression-free survival, and, in some cases, overall survival, are modest. Thus, a crucial issue in development of these drugs is the search for predictive biomarkers-tests that predict which patients will, and will not, benefit before initiation of therapy. Development of biomarkers is important because of the need to balance efficacy, toxicity, and cost. Novel combinations of these drugs with other antiangiogenics or other classes of drugs are being developed, and the appreciation that these drugs have immunomodulatory and other modes of action will lead to combination regimens that capitalise on these newly understood mechanisms.

2016,Lancet,"Costs, affordability, and feasibility of an essential package of cancer control interventions in low-income and middle-income countries: key messages from Disease Control Priorities, 3rd edition.","Investments in cancer control--prevention, detection, diagnosis, surgery, other treatment, and palliative care--are increasingly needed in low-income and particularly in middle-income countries, where most of the world's cancer deaths occur without treatment or palliation. To help countries expand locally appropriate services, Cancer (the third volume of nine in Disease Control Priorities, 3rd edition) developed an essential package of potentially cost-effective measures for countries to consider and adapt. Interventions included in the package are: prevention of tobacco-related cancer and virus-related liver and cervical cancers; diagnosis and treatment of early breast cancer, cervical cancer, and selected childhood cancers; and widespread availability of palliative care, including opioids. These interventions would cost an additional US$20 billion per year worldwide, constituting 3% of total public spending on health in low-income and middle-income countries. With implementation of an appropriately tailored package, most countries could substantially reduce suffering and premature death from cancer before 2030, with even greater improvements in later decades.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2015,Lancet,"Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100, a therapeutic synthetic DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus 16 and 18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial.","Despite preventive vaccines for oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is common, and current treatments are ablative and can lead to long-term reproductive morbidity. We assessed whether VGX-3100, synthetic plasmids targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins, delivered by electroporation, would cause histopathological regression in women with CIN2/3.Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 were assessed in CIN2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b study. Patients from 36 academic and private gynaecology practices in seven countries were randomised (3:1) to receive 6 mg VGX-3100 or placebo (1 mL), given intramuscularly at 0, 4, and 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by age (<25 vs ≥25 years) and CIN2 versus CIN3 by computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4). Funder and site personnel, participants, and pathologists were masked to treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was regression to CIN1 or normal pathology 36 weeks after the first dose. Per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat analyses were based on patients receiving three doses without protocol violations, and on patients receiving at least one dose, respectively. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01304524) and EudraCT (number 2012-001334-33).Between Oct 19, 2011, and July 30, 2013, 167 patients received either VGX-3100 (n=125) or placebo (n=42). In the per-protocol analysis 53 (49·5%) of 107 VGX-3100 recipients and 11 (30·6%) of 36 placebo recipients had histopathological regression (percentage point difference 19·0 [95% CI 1·4-36·6]; p=0·034). In the modified intention-to-treat analysis 55 (48·2%) of 114 VGX-3100 recipients and 12 (30·0%) of 40 placebo recipients had histopathological regression (percentage point difference 18·2 [95% CI 1·3-34·4]; p=0·034). Injection-site reactions occurred in most patients, but only erythema was significantly more common in the VGX-3100 group (98/125, 78·4%) than in the placebo group (24/42, 57·1%; percentage point difference 21·3 [95% CI 5·3-37·8]; p=0·007).VGX-3100 is the first therapeutic vaccine to show efficacy against CIN2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18. VGX-3100 could present a non-surgical therapeutic option for CIN2/3, changing the treatment outlook for this common disease.Inovio Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2015,Lancet,"Global surveillance of cancer survival 1995-2009: analysis of individual data for 25,676,887 patients from 279 population-based registries in 67 countries (CONCORD-2).","Worldwide data for cancer survival are scarce. We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control.Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25·7 million adults (age 15-99 years) and 75,000 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995-2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005-09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15-19% in North America, and as low as 7-9% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10-20% between 1995-99 and 2005-09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50% to more than 70%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995-99 and 2005-09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005-09, 5-year survival was 40% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005-09 was high (54-58%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18-23%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60% in several countries, but as high as 90% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease.International comparison of survival trends reveals very wide differences that are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimum treatment. Continuous worldwide surveillance of cancer survival should become an indispensable source of information for cancer patients and researchers and a stimulus for politicians to improve health policy and health-care systems.Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (Toronto, Canada), Cancer Focus Northern Ireland (Belfast, UK), Cancer Institute New South Wales (Sydney, Australia), Cancer Research UK (London, UK), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA), Swiss Re (London, UK), Swiss Cancer Research foundation (Bern, Switzerland), Swiss Cancer League (Bern, Switzerland), and University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY, USA).Copyright © 2015 Allemani et al.

2014,Lancet,"Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in women older than 25 years: 4-year interim follow-up of the phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled VIVIANE study.","Although adolescent girls are the main population for prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, adult women who remain at risk of cervical cancer can also be vaccinated. We report data from the interim analysis of the ongoing VIVIANE study, the aim of which is to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in adult women.In this phase 3, multinational, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy women older than 25 years to the HPV 16/18 vaccine or control (1:1), via an internet-based system with an algorithm process that accounted for region, age stratum, baseline HPV DNA status, HPV 16/18 serostatus, and cytology. Enrolment was age-stratified, with about 45% of participants in each of the 26-35 and 36-45 years age strata and 10% in the 46 years and older stratum. Up to 15% of women in each age stratum could have a history of HPV infection or disease. The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or higher (CIN1+) associated with HPV 16/18. The primary analysis was done in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy, which consists of women who received all three vaccine or control doses, had negative or low-grade cytology at baseline, and had no history of HPV disease. Secondary analyses included vaccine efficacy against non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types. Mean follow-up time was 40·3 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00294047.The first participant was enrolled on Feb 16, 2006, and the last study visit for the present analysis took place on Dec 10, 2010; 5752 women were included in the total vaccinated cohort (n=2881 vaccine, n=2871 control), and 4505 in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (n=2264 vaccine, n=2241 control). Vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-related 6-month persistent infection or CIN1+ was significant in all age groups combined (81·1%, 97·7% CI 52·1-94·0), in the 26-35 years age group (83·5%, 45·0-96·8), and in the 36-45 years age group (77·2%, 2·8-96·9); no cases were seen in women aged 46 years and older. Vaccine efficacy against atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater associated with HPV 16/18 was also significant. We also noted significant cross-protective vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection with HPV 31 (79·1%, 97·7% CI 27·6-95·9) and HPV 45 (76·9%, 18·5-95·6]) Serious adverse events occurred in 285 (10%) of 2881 women in the vaccine group and 267 (9%) of 2871 in the control group; five (<1%) and eight (<1%) of these events, respectively, were believed to be related to vaccination.In women older than 25 years, the HPV 16/18 vaccine is efficacious against infections and cervical abnormalities associated with the vaccine types, as well as infections with the non-vaccine HPV types 31 and 45.GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2014,Lancet,Efficacy of HPV-based screening for prevention of invasive cervical cancer: follow-up of four European randomised controlled trials.,"In four randomised trials, human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening for cervical cancer was compared with cytology-based cervical screening, and precursors of cancer were the endpoint in every trial. However, direct estimates are missing of the relative efficacy of HPV-based versus cytology-based screening for prevention of invasive cancer in women who undergo regular screening, of modifiers (eg, age) of this relative efficacy, and of the duration of protection. We did a follow-up study of the four randomised trials to investigate these outcomes.176,464 women aged 20-64 years were randomly assigned to HPV-based (experimental arm) or cytology-based (control arm) screening in Sweden (Swedescreen), the Netherlands (POBASCAM), England (ARTISTIC), and Italy (NTCC). We followed up these women for a median of 6·5 years (1,214,415 person-years) and identified 107 invasive cervical carcinomas by linkage with screening, pathology, and cancer registries, by masked review of histological specimens, or from reports. Cumulative and study-adjusted rate ratios (experimental vs control) were calculated for incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma.The rate ratio for invasive cervical carcinoma among all women from recruitment to end of follow-up was 0·60 (95% CI 0·40-0·89), with no heterogeneity between studies (p=0·52). Detection of invasive cervical carcinoma was similar between screening methods during the first 2·5 years of follow-up (0·79, 0·46-1·36) but was significantly lower in the experimental arm thereafter (0·45, 0·25-0·81). In women with a negative screening test at entry, the rate ratio was 0·30 (0·15-0·60). The cumulative incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma in women with negative entry tests was 4·6 per 10(5) (1·1-12·1) and 8·7 per 10(5) (3·3-18·6) at 3·5 and 5·5 years, respectively, in the experimental arm, and 15·4 per 10(5) (7·9-27·0) and 36·0 per 10(5) (23·2-53·5), respectively, in the control arm. Rate ratios did not differ by cancer stage, but were lower for adenocarcinoma (0·31, 0·14-0·69) than for squamous-cell carcinoma (0·78, 0·49-1·25). The rate ratio was lowest in women aged 30-34 years (0·36, 0·14-0·94).HPV-based screening provides 60-70% greater protection against invasive cervical carcinomas compared with cytology. Data of large-scale randomised trials support initiation of HPV-based screening from age 30 years and extension of screening intervals to at least 5 years.European Union, Belgian Foundation Against Cancer, KCE-Centre d'Expertise, IARC, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, the Italian Ministry of Health.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2013,Lancet,Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus infection. Most human papillomavirus infection is harmless and clears spontaneously but persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (especially type 16) can cause cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis, and oropharynx. The virus exclusively infects epithelium and produces new viral particles only in fully mature epithelial cells. Human papillomavirus disrupts normal cell-cycle control, promoting uncontrolled cell division and the accumulation of genetic damage. Two effective prophylactic vaccines composed of human papillomavirus type 16 and 18, and human papillomavirus type 16, 18, 6, and 11 virus-like particles have been introduced in many developed countries as a primary prevention strategy. Human papillomavirus testing is clinically valuable for secondary prevention in triaging low-grade cytology and as a test of cure after treatment. More sensitive than cytology, primary screening by human papillomavirus testing could enable screening intervals to be extended. If these prevention strategies can be implemented in developing countries, many thousands of lives could be saved. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA
2012,Lancet,Global burden of cancer in 2008: a systematic analysis of disability-adjusted life-years in 12 world regions.,"Country comparisons that consider the effect of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes are needed for health-care planning. We calculated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to estimate the global burden of cancer in 2008.We used population-based data, mostly from cancer registries, for incidence, mortality, life expectancy, disease duration, and age at onset and death, alongside proportions of patients who were treated and living with sequelae or regarded as cured, to calculate years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). We used YLLs and YLDs to derive DALYs for 27 sites of cancers in 184 countries in 12 world regions. Estimates were grouped into four categories based on a country's human development index (HDI). We applied zero discounting and uniform age weighting, and age-standardised rates to enable cross-country and regional comparisons.Worldwide, an estimated 169·3 million years of healthy life were lost because of cancer in 2008. Colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers were the main contributors to total DALYs in most world regions and caused 18-50% of the total cancer burden. We estimated an additional burden of 25% from infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and cervical) in sub-Saharan Africa, and 27% in eastern Asia. We noted substantial global differences in the cancer profile of DALYs by country and region; however, YLLs were the most important component of DALYs in all countries and for all cancers, and contributed to more than 90% of the total burden. Nonetheless, low-resource settings had consistently higher YLLs (as a proportion of total DALYs) than did high-resource settings.Age-adjusted DALYs lost from cancer are substantial, irrespective of world region. The consistently larger proportions of YLLs in low HDI than in high HDI countries indicate substantial inequalities in prognosis after diagnosis, related to degree of human development. Therefore, radical improvement in cancer care is needed in low-resource countries.Dutch Scientific Society, Erasmus University Rotterdam, and International Agency for research on Cancer.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2012,Lancet,Cancer mortality in India: a nationally representative survey.,"The age-specific mortality rates and total deaths from specific cancers have not been documented for the various regions and subpopulations of India. We therefore assessed the cause of death in 2001-03 in homes in small areas that were chosen to be representative of all the parts of India.At least 130 trained physicians independently assigned causes to 122,429 deaths, which occurred in 1·1 million homes in 6671 small areas that were randomly selected to be representative of all of India, based on a structured non-medical surveyor's field report.7137 of 122,429 study deaths were due to cancer, corresponding to 556,400 national cancer deaths in India in 2010. 395,400 (71%) cancer deaths occurred in people aged 30-69 years (200,100 men and 195,300 women). At 30-69 years, the three most common fatal cancers were oral (including lip and pharynx, 45,800 [22·9%]), stomach (25,200 [12·6%]), and lung (including trachea and larynx, 22,900 [11·4%]) in men, and cervical (33,400 [17·1%]), stomach (27,500 [14·1%]), and breast (19,900 [10·2%]) in women. Tobacco-related cancers represented 42·0% (84,000) of male and 18·3% (35,700) of female cancer deaths and there were twice as many deaths from oral cancers as lung cancers. Age-standardised cancer mortality rates per 100,000 were similar in rural (men 95·6 [99% CI 89·6-101·7] and women 96·6 [90·7-102·6]) and urban areas (men 102·4 [92·7-112·1] and women 91·2 [81·9-100·5]), but varied greatly between the states, and were two times higher in the least educated than in the most educated adults (men, illiterate 106·6 [97·4-115·7] vs most educated 45·7 [37·8-53·6]; women, illiterate 106·7 [99·9-113·6] vs most educated 43·4 [30·7-56·1]). Cervical cancer was far less common in Muslim than in Hindu women (study deaths 24, age-standardised mortality ratio 0·68 [0·64-0·71] vs 340, 1·06 [1·05-1·08]).Prevention of tobacco-related and cervical cancers and earlier detection of treatable cancers would reduce cancer deaths in India, particularly in the rural areas that are underserved by cancer services. The substantial variation in cancer rates in India suggests other risk factors or causative agents that remain to be discovered.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and US National Institutes of Health.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In early-stage cervical cancer during the first and at the beginning of the second trimester, the two main considerations for management of the patient are the tumour size (and stage) and nodal staging. MRI and laparoscopic lymphadenectomy are useful for clinicians planning a potentially conservative approach. The management of patients with locally advanced cervical disease is controversial and should be discussed on a case-by-case basis according to the tumour size, radiological findings, the term of pregnancy, and the patient's wishes. Different histological types of malignant ovarian diseases arise during pregnancy and their management depends on the diagnosis (histological subtypes, tumour differentiation, and nodal status), the tumour stage, and the trimester of the pregnancy. In patients with peritoneal spread or high-risk early-stage disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pregnancy preservation could be appropriate.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA
2011,Lancet,Self-collection of vaginal specimens for human papillomavirus testing in cervical cancer prevention (MARCH): a community-based randomised controlled trial.,"Vaginal self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing could increase rates of screening participation. In clinic-based settings, vaginal HPV testing is at least as sensitive as cytology for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse; however, effectiveness in home settings is unknown. We aimed to establish the relative sensitivity and positive predictive value for HPV screening of vaginal samples self-collected at home as compared with clinic-based cervical cytology.We did a community-based, randomised equivalence trial in Mexican women of low socioeconomic status aged 25-65 years. Participants came from 540 medically underserved, predominantly rural communities in Morelos, Guerrero, and the state of Mexico. Our primary endpoint was CIN 2 or worse, detected by colposcopy. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly allocate patients to HPV screening or cervical cytology. Eight community nurses who were masked to patient allocation received daily lists of the women's names and addresses, and did the assigned home visits. We referred women with positive results in either test to colposcopy. We did per-protocol and intention-to-screen analyses. This trial was registered with the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Mexico, INSP number 590.12,330 women were randomly allocated to HPV screening and 12,731 to cervical cytology; 9202 women in the HPV screening group adhered to the protocol, as did 11,054 in the cervical cytology group. HPV prevalence was 9·8% (95% CI 9·1-10·4) and abnormal cytology rate was 0·38% (0·23-0·45). HPV testing identified 117·4 women with CIN 2 or worse per 10,000 (95·2-139·5) compared with 34·4 women with CIN 2 or worse per 10,000 (23·4-45·3) identified by cytology; the relative sensitivity of HPV testing was 3·4 times greater (2·4-4·9). Similarly, HPV testing detected 4·2 times (1·9-9·2) more invasive cancers than did cytology (30·4 per 10,000 [19·1-41·7] vs 7·2 per 10,000 [2·2-12·3]). The positive predictive value of HPV testing for CIN 2 or worse was 12·2% (9·9-14·5) compared with 90·5% (61·7-100) for cytology.Despite the much lower positive predictive value for HPV testing of self-collected vaginal specimens compared with cytology, such testing might be preferred for detecting CIN 2 or worse in low-resource settings where restricted infrastructure reduces the effectiveness of cytology screening programmes. Because women at these sites will be screened only a few times in their lives, the high sensitivity of a HPV screen is of paramount importance.Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, the Health Ministry of Mexico, QiAGEN Corp.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2011,Lancet,Breast and cervical cancer in 187 countries between 1980 and 2010: a systematic analysis.,"Breast and cervical cancer are important causes of mortality in women aged ≥15 years. We undertook annual age-specific assessments of breast and cervical cancer in 187 countries.We systematically collected cancer registry data on mortality and incidence, vital registration, and verbal autopsy data for the period 1980-2010. We modelled the mortality-to-incidence (MI) ratio using a hierarchical model. Vital registration and verbal autopsy were supplemented with incidence multiplied by the MI ratio to yield a comprehensive database of mortality rates. We used Gaussian process regression to develop estimates of mortality with uncertainty by age, sex, country, and year. We used out-of-sample predictive validity to select the final model. Estimates of incidence with uncertainty were also generated with mortality and MI ratios.Global breast cancer incidence increased from 641,000 (95% uncertainty intervals 610,000-750,000) cases in 1980 to 1,643,000 (1,421,000-1,782,000) cases in 2010, an annual rate of increase of 3·1%. Global cervical cancer incidence increased from 378,000 (256,000-489,000) cases per year in 1980 to 454,000 (318,000-620,000) cases per year in 2010-a 0·6% annual rate of increase. Breast cancer killed 425,000 (359,000-453,000) women in 2010, of whom 68,000 (62,000-74,000) were aged 15-49 years in developing countries. Cervical cancer death rates have been decreasing but the disease still killed 200,000 (139,000-276,000) women in 2010, of whom 46,000 (33,000-64,000) were aged 15-49 years in developing countries. We recorded pronounced variation in the trend in breast cancer mortality across regions and countries.More policy attention is needed to strengthen established health-system responses to reduce breast and cervical cancer, especially in developing countries.Susan G Komen for the Cure and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2011,Lancet,"Early effect of the HPV vaccination programme on cervical abnormalities in Victoria, Australia: an ecological study.","Australia introduced a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for all women aged 12-26 years between 2007 and 2009. We analysed trends in cervical abnormalities in women in Victoria, Australia, before and after introduction of the vaccination programme.With data from the Victorian Cervical Cytology Registry between 2003 and 2009, we compared the incidence of histopathologically defined high-grade cervical abnormalities (HGAs, lesions coded as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse or adenocarcinoma in situ; primary outcome) and low-grade cytological abnormalities (LGAs) in five age groups before (Jan 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007) and after (April 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2009) the vaccination programme began. Binary comparisons between the two periods were done with Fisher's exact test. Poisson piecewise regression analysis was used to compare incident rate trends.After the introduction of the vaccination programme, we recorded a decrease in the incidence of HGAs by 0·38% (95% CI 0·61-0·16) in girls younger than 18 years. This decrease was progressive and significantly different to the linear trend in incidence before introduction of the vaccination (incident rate ratio 1·14, 1·00-1·30, p=0·05). No similar temporal decline was recorded for LGAs or in older age groups.This is the first report of a decrease in incidence of HGAs within 3 years after the implementation of a population-wide HPV vaccination programme. Linkage between vaccination and screening registers is needed to confirm that this ecological observation is attributable to vaccination and to monitor participation in screening among vaccinated women.None.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine up to 6.4 years.Women aged 15-25 years, with normal cervical cytology, who were HPV-16/18 seronegative and oncogenic HPV DNA-negative (14 types) at screening participated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled initial study (n=1113; 560 vaccine group vs 553 placebo group) and follow-up study (n=776; 393 vs 383). 27 sites in three countries participated in the follow-up study. Cervical samples were tested every 6 months for HPV DNA. Management of abnormal cytologies was prespecified, and HPV-16/18 antibody titres were assessed. The primary objective was to assess long-term vaccine efficacy in the prevention of incident cervical infection with HPV 16 or HPV 18, or both. We report the analyses up to 6.4 years of this follow-up study and combined with the initial study. For the primary endpoint, the efficacy analysis was done in the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort; the analysis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above (CIN2+) was done in the total vaccinated cohort (TVC). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00120848.For the combined analysis of the initial and follow-up studies, the ATP efficacy cohort included 465 women in the vaccine group and 454 in the placebo group; the TVC included 560 women in the vaccine group and 553 in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against incident infection with HPV 16/18 was 95.3% (95% CI 87.4-98.7) and against 12-month persistent infection was 100% (81.8-100). Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ was 100% (51.3-100) for lesions associated with HPV-16/18 and 71.9% (20.6-91.9) for lesions independent of HPV DNA. Antibody concentrations by ELISA remained 12-fold or more higher than after natural infection (both antigens). Safety outcomes were similar between groups: during the follow-up study, 30 (8%) participants reported a serious adverse event in the vaccine group versus 37 (10%) in the placebo group. None was judged related or possibly related to vaccination, and no deaths occurred.Our findings show excellent long-term efficacy, high and sustained immunogenicity, and favourable safety of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine up to 6.4 years.GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Belgium).",NA

We now assess the vaccine efficacy in the final event-driven analysis.Women (15-25 years) were vaccinated at months 0, 1, and 6. Analyses were done in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (ATP-E; vaccine, n=8093; control, n=8069), total vaccinated cohort (TVC, included all women receiving at least one vaccine dose, regardless of their baseline HPV status; represents the general population, including those who are sexually active; vaccine, n=9319; control, n=9325), and TVC-naive (no evidence of oncogenic HPV infection at baseline; represents women before sexual debut; vaccine, n=5822; control, n=5819). The primary endpoint was to assess vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN2+) that was associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 in women who were seronegative at baseline, and DNA negative at baseline and month 6 for the corresponding type (ATP-E). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00122681.Mean follow-up was 34.9 months (SD 6.4) after the third dose. Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 92.9% (96.1% CI 79.9-98.3) in the primary analysis and 98.1% (88.4-100) in an analysis in which probable causality to HPV type was assigned in lesions infected with multiple oncogenic types (ATP-E cohort). Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ irrespective of HPV DNA in lesions was 30.4% (16.4-42.1) in the TVC and 70.2% (54.7-80.9) in the TVC-naive. Corresponding values against CIN3+ were 33.4% (9.1-51.5) in the TVC and 87.0% (54.9-97.7) in the TVC-naive.

We tested the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like-particle vaccine in women aged 24-45 years.Women aged 24-45 years with no history of genital warts or cervical disease were enrolled from community health centres, academic health centres, and primary health-care providers into an ongoing multicentre, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Participants were allocated by computer-generated schedule to receive quadrivalent HPV vaccine (n=1911) or placebo (n=1908) at day 1, and months 2 and 6. All study site investigators and personnel, study participants, monitors, and central laboratory personnel were blinded to treatment allocation. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were 6 months' or more duration of infection and cervical and external genital disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18; and due to HPV 16 and 18 alone. Primary efficacy analyses were done in a per-protocol population, but intention-to-treat analyses were also undertaken.

2008,Lancet,"Primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of preterm birth.","Interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of preterm birth can be primary (directed to all women), secondary (aimed at eliminating or reducing existing risk), or tertiary (intended to improve outcomes for preterm infants). Most efforts so far have been tertiary interventions, such as regionalised care, and treatment with antenatal corticosteroids, tocolytic agents, and antibiotics. These measures have reduced perinatal morbidity and mortality, but the incidence of preterm birth is increasing.

2007,Lancet,"Cervical cancer and hormonal contraceptives: collaborative reanalysis of individual data for 16,573 women with cervical cancer and 35,509 women without cervical cancer from 24 epidemiological studies.","Combined oral contraceptives are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a cause of cervical cancer. As the incidence of cervical cancer increases with age, the public-health implications of this association depend largely on the persistence of effects long after use of oral contraceptives has ceased. Information from 24 studies worldwide is pooled here to investigate the association between cervical carcinoma and pattern of oral contraceptive use.Individual data for 16,573 women with cervical cancer and 35,509 without cervical cancer were reanalysed centrally. Relative risks of cervical cancer were estimated by conditional logistic regression, stratifying by study, age, number of sexual partners, age at first intercourse, parity, smoking, and screening.Among current users of oral contraceptives the risk of invasive cervical cancer increased with increasing duration of use (relative risk for 5 or more years' use versus never use, 1.90 [95% CI 1.69-2.13]). The risk declined after use ceased, and by 10 or more years had returned to that of never users. A similar pattern of risk was seen both for invasive and in-situ cancer, and in women who tested positive for high-risk human papillomavirus. Relative risk did not vary substantially between women with different characteristics.The relative risk of cervical cancer is increased in current users of oral contraceptives and declines after use ceases. 10 years' use of oral contraceptives from around age 20 to 30 years is estimated to increase the cumulative incidence of invasive cervical cancer by age 50 from 7.3 to 8.3 per 1000 in less developed countries and from 3.8 to 4.5 per 1000 in more developed countries.",NA
2007,Lancet,Human papillomavirus DNA testing for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cancer: 5-year follow-up of a randomised controlled implementation trial.,"Tests for the DNA of high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have a higher sensitivity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) than does cytological testing, but the necessity of such testing in cervical screening has been debated. Our aim was to determine whether the effectiveness of cervical screening improves when HPV DNA testing is implemented.Women aged 29-56 years who were participating in the regular cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to combined cytological and HPV DNA testing or to conventional cytological testing only. After 5 years, combined cytological and HPV DNA testing were done in both groups. The primary outcome measure was the number of CIN3+ lesions detected. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN20781131.8575 women in the intervention group and 8580 in the control group were recruited, followed up for sufficient time (> or =6.5 years), and met eligibility criteria for our analyses. More CIN3+ lesions were detected at baseline in the intervention group than in the control group (68/8575 vs 40/8580, 70% increase, 95% CI 15-151; p=0.007). The number of CIN3+ lesions detected in the subsequent round was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (24/8413 vs 54/8456, 55% decrease, 95% CI 28-72; p=0.001). The number of CIN3+ lesions over the two rounds did not differ between groups.The implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of CIN3+ lesions. Earlier detection of such lesions could permit an extension of the screening interval.",NA
2007,Lancet,Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, and knowledge regarding its cause and pathogenesis is expanding rapidly. Persistent infection with one of about 15 genotypes of carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) causes almost all cases. There are four major steps in cervical cancer development: infection of metaplastic epithelium at the cervical transformation zone, viral persistence, progression of persistently infected epithelium to cervical precancer, and invasion through the basement membrane of the epithelium. Infection is extremely common in young women in their first decade of sexual activity. Persistent infections and precancer are established, typically within 5-10 years, from less than 10% of new infections. Invasive cancer arises over many years, even decades, in a minority of women with precancer, with a peak or plateau in risk at about 35-55 years of age. Each genotype of HPV acts as an independent infection, with differing carcinogenic risks linked to evolutionary species. Our understanding has led to improved prevention and clinical management strategies, including improved screening tests and vaccines. The new HPV-oriented model of cervical carcinogenesis should gradually replace older morphological models based only on cytology and histology. If applied wisely, HPV-related technology can minimise the incidence of cervical cancer, and the morbidity and mortality it causes, even in low-resource settings.",NA

Healthy women aged 30 to 59 years were eligible for the study. Screen-positive women had colposcopy, directed biopsies, and, where appropriate, cryotherapy by nurses during the screening visit. Those with larger precancerous lesions or invasive cancers were referred for appropriate investigations and treatment. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the study groups were analysed and compared using Cox regression taking the cluster design into account, and analysis was by intention to treat.

We assessed cervical cytology and subsequent biopsy for 14 oncogenic HPV types by PCR. The primary endpoint--vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ associated with HPV16 or HPV18--was assessed in women who were seronegative and DNA negative for the corresponding vaccine type at baseline (month 0) and allowed inclusion of lesions with several oncogenic HPV types. This interim event-defined analysis was triggered when at least 23 cases of CIN2+ with HPV16 or HPV18 DNA in the lesion were detected in the total vaccinated cohort for efficacy. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.

We included women who originally received all three doses of bivalent HPV-16/18 virus-like particle AS04 vaccine (0.5 mL; n=393) or placebo (n=383). We assessed HPV DNA, using cervical samples, and did yearly cervical cytology assessments. We also studied the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine.More than 98% seropositivity was maintained for HPV-16/18 antibodies during the extended follow-up phase. We noted significant vaccine efficacy against HPV-16 and HPV-18 endpoints: incident infection, 96.9% (95% CI 81.3-99.9); persistent infection: 6 month definition, 94.3 (63.2-99.9); 12 month definition, 100% (33.6-100). In a combined analysis of the initial efficacy and extended follow-up studies, vaccine efficacy of 100% (42.4-100) against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions associated with vaccine types. We noted broad protection against cytohistological outcomes beyond that anticipated for HPV 16/18 and protection against incident infection with HPV 45 and HPV 31. The vaccine has a good long-term safety profile.Up to 4.5 years, the HPV-16/18 L1 virus-like particle AS04 vaccine is highly immunogenic and safe, and induces a high degree of protection against HPV-16/18 infection and associated cervical lesions. There is also evidence of cross protection.",NA
2006,Lancet,Obstetric outcomes after conservative treatment for intraepithelial or early invasive cervical lesions: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Conservative methods to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and microinvasive cervical cancer are commonly used in young women because of the advent of effective screening programmes. In a meta-analysis, we investigated the effect of these procedures on subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes.We searched for studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE and classified them by the conservative method used and the outcome measure studied regarding both fertility and pregnancy. Pooled relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated with a random-effects model and interstudy heterogeneity was assessed with Cochrane's Q test.We identified 27 studies. Cold knife conisation was significantly associated with preterm delivery (<37 weeks; relative risk 2.59, 95% CI 1.80-3.72, 100/704 [14%] vs 1494/27 674 [5%]), low birthweight (<2500 g; 2.53, 1.19-5.36, 32/261 [12%] vs 905/13 229 [7%]), and caesarean section (3.17, 1.07-9.40, 31/350 [9%] vs 22/670 [3%]). Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) was also significantly associated with preterm delivery (1.70, 1.24-2.35, 156/1402 [11%] vs 120/1739 [7%]), low birthweight (1.82, 1.09-3.06, 77/996 [8%] vs 49/1192 [4%]), and premature rupture of the membranes (2.69, 1.62-4.46, 48/905 [5%] vs 22/1038 [2%]). Similar but marginally non-significant adverse effects were recorded for laser conisation (preterm delivery 1.71, 0.93-3.14). We did not detect significantly increased risks for obstetric outcomes after laser ablation. Although severe outcomes such as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit or perinatal mortality showed adverse trends, these changes were not significant.All the excisional procedures to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia present similar pregnancy-related morbidity without apparent neonatal morbidity. Caution in the treatment of young women with mild cervical abnormalities should be recommended. Clinicians now have the evidence base to counsel women appropriately.",NA
2006,Lancet,"Effect of study design and quality on unsatisfactory rates, cytology classifications, and accuracy in liquid-based versus conventional cervical cytology: a systematic review.","Liquid-based cytology is reported to increase the sensitivity of cervical cytology and the proportion of slides that are satisfactory for assessment, in comparison with conventional cytology. Although some countries have changed to liquid-based cytology for cervical screening, controversy remains. We reviewed the published work to assess the performance of liquid-based cytology relative to conventional cytology in primary studies assessed to be of low, medium, or high methodological quality.56 primary studies were reviewed and assessed with strict methodological criteria. Liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology were compared in terms of the percentage of slides classified as unsatisfactory, the percentage of slides classified in each cytology category, and the accuracy of detection of high-grade disease. Data were examined for studies overall and in strata to examine the effect of study quality on results.The median difference in the percentage of unsatisfactory slides between liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology was 0.17%. Only one small study was a randomised controlled trial. The classification of high-grade squamous epithelial lesion varied according to study quality (p=0.04), with conventional cytology classifying more slides in this category than did liquid-based cytology in high-quality studies (n=3) only. In medium-quality (n=30) and high-quality studies, liquid-based cytology classified more slides as atypical squamous cells of unknown significance than did conventional cytology when compared with low-quality studies (n=17; p=0.05). Only four studies provided sufficient verified data to allow estimation of sensitivity and specificity and comparison of test accuracy.We saw no evidence that liquid-based cytology reduced the proportion of unsatisfactory slides, or detected more high-grade lesions in high-quality studies, than conventional cytology. This review does not lend support to claims of better performance by liquid-based cytology. Large randomised controlled trials are needed.",NA
2005,Lancet,Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors.,"With respect to reducing mortality, advances in cancer treatment have not been as effective as those for other chronic diseases; effective screening methods are available for only a few cancers. Primary prevention through lifestyle and environmental interventions remains the main way to reduce the burden of cancers. In this report, we estimate mortality from 12 types of cancer attributable to nine risk factors in seven World Bank regions for 2001.We analysed data from the Comparative Risk Assessment project and from new sources to assess exposure to risk factors and relative risk by age, sex, and region. We applied population attributable fractions for individual and multiple risk factors to site-specific cancer mortality from WHO.Of the 7 million deaths from cancer worldwide in 2001, an estimated 2.43 million (35%) were attributable to nine potentially modifiable risk factors. Of these, 0.76 million deaths were in high-income countries and 1.67 million in low-and-middle-income nations. Among low-and-middle-income regions, Europe and Central Asia had the highest proportion (39%) of deaths from cancer attributable to the risk factors studied. 1.6 million of the deaths attributable to these risk factors were in men and 0.83 million in women. Smoking, alcohol use, and low fruit and vegetable intake were the leading risk factors for death from cancer worldwide and in low-and-middle-income countries. In high-income countries, smoking, alcohol use, and overweight and obesity were the most important causes of cancer. Sexual transmission of human papilloma virus is a leading risk factor for cervical cancer in women in low-and-middle-income countries.Reduction of exposure to key behavioural and environmental risk factors would prevent a substantial proportion of deaths from cancer.",NA
2003,Lancet,Management of women who test positive for high-risk types of human papillomavirus: the HART study.,"Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the primary cause of almost all cervical cancers. HPV testing of cervical smears is more sensitive but less specific than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+). HPV testing as a primary screening approach requires efficient management of HPV-positive women with negative or borderline cytology. We aimed to compare the detection rate and positive predictive values of HPV assay with cytology and to determine the best management strategy for HPV-positive women.We did a multicentre screening study of 11085 women aged 30-60 years. Women with borderline cytology and women positive for high-risk HPV with negative cytology were randomised to immediate colposcopy or to surveillance by repeat HPV testing, cytology, and colposcopy at 12 months.HPV testing was more sensitive than borderline or worse cytology (97.1% vs 76.6%, p=0.002) but less specific (93.3% vs 95.8%, p<0.0001) for detecting CIN2+. Of 825 randomised women, surveillance at 12 months was as effective as immediate colposcopy. In women positive for HPV at baseline, who had surveillance, 73 (45%) of 164 women with negative cytology and eight (35%) of 23 women with borderline cytology were HPV negative at 6-12 months. No CIN2+ was found in these women, nor in women with an initial negative HPV test with borderline (n=211) or mild (32) cytology.HPV testing could be used for primary screening in women older than 30 years, with cytology used to triage HPV-positive women. HPV-positive women with normal or borderline cytology (about 6% of screened women) could be managed by repeat testing after 12 months. This approach could potentially improve detection rates of CIN2+ without increasing the colposcopy referral rate.",NA
2003,Lancet,Mortality in relation to oral contraceptive use and cigarette smoking.,"As part of the Oxford Family Planning Association study, we compared mortality in relation to oral contraceptive use and smoking to highlight the differences between them from the perspective of public health.The study consisted of 17032 women, aged 25-39 years at entry, recruited between May 1, 1968, and July 31, 1974, who had used oral contraceptives, a diaphragm, or an intrauterine device. We assessed mortality from follow-up data recorded until Dec 31, 2000. The analysis is based on woman-years of observation.We analysed 889 deaths. Women who had ever used oral contraceptives had increased mortality from cervical cancer (rate ratio 7.2, 95% CI 1.1-303), and decreased mortality from other uterine (0.2, 0.0-0.8) and ovarian cancers (0.4, 0.2-0.7). Oral contraceptives had some adverse effect on deaths from ischaemic heart disease in women who smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day. For all causes of mortality, the rate ratio for death in women who ever used oral contraceptives was 0.89 (95% CI 0.77-1.02). By contrast, this rate ratio was 1.24 (1.03-1.49) in those who smoked one to 14 cigarettes per day, and 2.14 (1.81-2.53) in those who smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day.There was no harmful effect of oral contraceptive use on overall mortality. By contrast, death from all causes was more than twice as high in smokers of 15 or more cigarettes a day as in non-smokers. The harmful effect was already apparent in women aged 35-44 years.",NA
2003,Lancet,Cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is a serious health problem, with nearly 500000 women developing the disease each year worldwide. Most cases occur in less developed countries where no effective screening systems are available. Risk factors include exposure to human papillomavirus, smoking, and immune-system dysfunction. Most women with early-stage tumours can be cured, although long-term morbidity from treatment is common. Results of randomised clinical trials have shown that for women with locally advanced cancers, chemoradiotherapy should be regarded as the standard of care; however, the applicability of this treatment to women in less developed countries remains largely untested. Many women with localised (stage IB) tumours even now receive various combinations of surgery and radiotherapy, despite unresolved concern about the morbidity of this approach compared with definitive radiotherapy or radical surgery. Treatment of recurrent cervical cancer remains largely ineffective. Quality of life should be taken into account in treatment of women with primary and recurrent cervical cancer.",NA
2003,Lancet,Cervical cancer and use of hormonal contraceptives: a systematic review.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is believed to be the most important cause of cervical cancer. Recent studies suggest that long duration use of oral contraceptives increases the risk of cervical cancer in HPV positive women.Results from published studies were combined to examine the relationship between invasive and in situ cervical cancer and duration and recency of use of hormonal contraceptives, with particular attention to HPV infection.28 eligible studies were identified, together including 12531 women with cervical cancer. Compared with never users of oral contraceptives, the relative risks of cervical cancer increased with increasing duration of use: for durations of approximately less than 5 years, 5-9 years, and 10 or more years, respectively, the summary relative risks were 1.1 (95% CI 1.1-1.2), 1.6 (1.4-1.7), and 2.2 (1.9-2.4) for all women; and 0.9 (0.7-1.2), 1.3 (1.0-1.9), and 2.5 (1.6-3.9) for HPV positive women. The results were broadly similar for invasive and in situ cervical cancers, for squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, and in studies that adjusted for HPV status, number of sexual partners, cervical screening, smoking, or use of barrier contraceptives. The limited available data suggest that the relative risk of cervical cancer may decrease after use of oral contraceptives ceases. However, study designs varied and there was some heterogeneity between study results.Although long duration use of hormonal contraceptives is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer, the public health implications of these findings depend largely on the extent to which the observed associations remain long after use of hormonal contraceptives has ceased, and this cannot be evaluated properly from published data.",NA
2003,Lancet,"Safety, acceptability, and feasibility of a single-visit approach to cervical-cancer prevention in rural Thailand: a demonstration project.","To increase screening and treatment coverage, innovative approaches to cervical-cancer prevention are being investigated in rural Thailand. We assessed the value of a single-visit approach combining visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid wash (VIA) and cryotherapy.12 trained nurses provided services in mobile (village health centre-based) and static (hospital-based) teams in four districts of Roi-et Province, Thailand. Over 7 months, 5999 women were tested by VIA. If they tested positive, after counselling about the benefits, potential risks, and probable side-effects they were offered cryotherapy. Data measuring safety, acceptability, feasibility, and effort to implement the programme were gathered.The VIA test-positive rate was 13.3% (798/5999), and 98.5% (609/618) of those eligible accepted immediate treatment. Overall, 756 women received cryotherapy, 629 (83.2%) of whom returned for their first follow-up visit. No major complications were recorded, and 33 (4.4%) of those treated returned for a perceived problem. Only 17 (2.2%) of the treated women needed clinical management other than reassurance about side-effects. Both VIA and cryotherapy were highly acceptable to the patients (over 95% expressed satisfaction with their experience). At their 1-year visit, the squamocolumnar junction was visible to the nurses, and the VIA test-negative rate was 94.3%.A single-visit approach with VIA and cryotherapy seems to be safe, acceptable, and feasible in rural Thailand, and is a potentially efficient method of cervical-cancer prevention in such settings.",NA
2003,Lancet,Human papillomavirus type 18 and rapidly progressing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18) is the second most frequent of the HPV types detected when squamous-cell cancer is diagnosed and the type most strongly associated with adenocarcinoma of the cervix. However, in cross-sectional studies, HPV-18 is rarely detected at the time of diagnosis of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We used a longitudinal study design to describe the occurrence of cytological abnormality after incident HPV-18 and HPV-16 infections.The analysis was based on 1075 women aged 15-19 years, who had normal cytology and were negative for HPV at recruitment from a single family-planning clinic, and who had further follow-up. The women reattended every 6 months, and samples were taken for cytological and virological examination.The relative risk of a cytological diagnosis of borderline nuclear abnormality after exposure to HPV-18 was 2.06 (95% CI 1.24-3.43) and that after exposure to HPV-16 was 1.99 (1.32-3.01). The relative risks of mild dyskaryosis were 3.11 (1.86-5.18) and 4.76 (3.15-7.18), and the relative risks of moderate or severe dyskaryosis were 0.80 (0.24-2.65) and 2.85 (1.36-5.97). Time to acquisition of cytological abnormality was unrelated to the infecting type (p=0.88).Our findings do not support the long-held view that the reason why HPV-18 infection is under-represented at the time of diagnosis of high-grade CIN is because HPV-18-associated disease rapidly progresses through the preinvasive stages of neoplasia. We suggest that the cytological changes detected after HPV-18 infection might understate the severity of underlying disease. This feature could compromise the effectiveness of screening programmes in reducing the frequency of HPV-18-associated cancers.",NA
2002,Lancet,Long-term survival rates of cancer patients achieved by the end of the 20th century: a period analysis.,"Long-term survival rates for many types of cancer have substantially improved in past decades because of advances in early detection and treatment. However, much of this improvement is only seen many years later with traditional cohort-based methods of survival analysis. I aimed to assess achievements in cancer patients' survival by an alternative method of survival analysis,known as period analysis, which provides more up-to-date estimates of long-term survival rates than do conventional methods.The 1973-98 database of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme of the US National Cancer Institute was analysed by period analysis.Estimates of 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year relative survival rates for all types of cancer were 63%, 57%, 53%, and 51%, respectively, by period analysis. These estimates were 1%, 7%, 11%, and 11% higher, respectively, than corresponding estimates by cohort-based survival analysis. By period analysis, 20-year relative survival rates were close to 90% for thyroid and testis cancer, exceeded 80% for melanomas and prostate cancer, were about 80% for endometrial cancer, and almost 70% for bladder cancer and Hodgkin's disease. A 20-year relative survival rate of 65% was estimated for breast cancer, of 60% for cervical cancer, and of about 50% for colorectal, ovarian, and renal cancer.Timely detection of improvements in long-term survival rates might help to prevent clinicians and their patients from undue discouragement or depression by outdated and often overly pessimistic survival expectations. It also adds to the value of cancer surveillance as a basis for appropriate public-health decisions.",NA
2002,Lancet,Viral load of human papillomavirus and risk of CIN3 or cervical cancer.,"Carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are thought to be necessary for development of cervical cancer. We assessed whether higher viral loads of such viruses predicted future risk of CIN3 or cancer (CIN3+) in a cohort of 20810 women followed up for 10 years with cytological screening. We measured the viral load for 13 types of carcinogenic HPV (relative light units normalised to 1 pg/mL HPV 16 positive controls [RLU/PC]) using Hybrid Capture 2 testing of cervicovaginal lavages obtained at enrolment. Results were stratified into four groups (RLU/PC 1 to <10, 10 to <100, 100 to <1000, > or = 1000). Although presence of HPV strongly increased risk of CIN3+, high viral load did not further predict risk of CIN3+.",NA
2002,Lancet,Role of parity and human papillomavirus in cervical cancer: the IARC multicentric case-control study.,"High parity has long been suspected of being associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer, but previous analyses of this association have not taken the strong effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) into account. To assess the role of reproductive factors in the progression from HPV infection to cancer, we did a pooled analysis including only HPV-positive women.We pooled data from eight case-control studies on invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) and two on in-situ carcinoma (ISC) from four continents. 1465 patients with squamous-cell ICCs, 211 with ISCs, 124 with adenocarcinomas or adenosquamous ICCs, and 255 control women, all positive for HPV DNA by PCR-based assays, were analysed. We calculated pooled odds ratios by means of unconditional multiple logistic regression models, and adjusted them for sexual and non-sexual confounding factors. The 95% CI were estimated by treating the odds ratio as floating absolute risk.We found a direct association between the number of full-term pregnancies and squamous-cell cancer risk: the odds ratio for seven full-term pregnancies or more was 3.8 (95% CI 2.7-5.5) compared with nulliparous women, and 2.3 (1.6-3.2) compared with women who had one or two full-term pregnancies. There was no significant association between risk of adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma and number of full-term pregnancies.High parity increases the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix among HPV-positive women. A general decline in parity might therefore partly explain the reduction in cervical cancer recently seen in most countries.",NA
2002,Lancet,Effect of oral contraceptives on risk of cervical cancer in women with human papillomavirus infection: the IARC multicentric case-control study.,"Use of oral contraceptives could increase risk of cervical cancer; however the effect of human papillomavirus (HPV), the main cause of cervical cancer, is not usually taken into account. We aimed to assess how use of oral contraceptives affected risk of cervical cancer in women who tested positive for HPV DNA.We pooled data from eight case-control studies of patients with histologically confirmed invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) and from two studies of patients with carcinoma in situ (ISC). Information about use of oral contraceptives was obtained from personal interviews. Effects were estimated as odds ratios, with logistic-regression models adjusted for possible confounders.1465 of 1561 (94%) patients with ICC, 211 of 292 (72%) with ISC, and 255 of 1916 (13%) controls were positive for HPV DNA. Compared with never-users, patients who had used oral contraceptives for fewer than 5 years did not have increased risk of cervical cancer (odds ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.52-1.03). The odds ratio for use of oral contraceptives was 2.82 (95% CI 1.46-5.42) for 5-9 years, and 4.03 (2.09-8.02) for use for 10 years or longer, and these risks did not vary by time since first or last use.Long-term use of oral contraceptives could be a cofactor that increases risk of cervical carcinoma by up to four-fold in women who are positive for cervical HPV DNA. In the absence of worldwide information about HPV status, extra effort should be made to include long-term users of oral contraceptives in cervical screening programmes.",NA
2002,Lancet,Uses and abuses of screening tests.,"Screening tests are ubiquitous in contemporary practice, yet the principles of screening are widely misunderstood. Screening is the testing of apparently well people to find those at increased risk of having a disease or disorder. Although an earlier diagnosis generally has intuitive appeal, earlier might not always be better, or worth the cost. Four terms describe the validity of a screening test: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of positive and negative results. For tests with continuous variables--eg, blood glucose--sensitivity and specificity are inversely related; where the cutoff for abnormal is placed should indicate the clinical effect of wrong results. The prevalence of disease in a population affects screening test performance: in low-prevalence settings, even very good tests have poor predictive value positives. Hence, knowledge of the approximate prevalence of disease is a prerequisite to interpreting screening test results. Tests are often done in sequence, as is true for syphilis and HIV-1 infection. Lead-time and length biases distort the apparent value of screening programmes; randomised controlled trials are the only way to avoid these biases. Screening can improve health; strong indirect evidence links cervical cytology programmes to declines in cervical cancer mortality. However, inappropriate application or interpretation of screening tests can rob people of their perceived health, initiate harmful diagnostic testing, and squander health-care resources.",NA
2002,Lancet,HIV-1 infection and risk of vulvovaginal and perianal condylomata acuminata and intraepithelial neoplasia: a prospective cohort study.,"Information about vulvovaginal and perianal condylomata acuminata and intraepithelial neoplasia in women infected with HIV-1 is needed to develop guidelines for clinical care. Our aim was to investigate the incidence of these lesions in HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative women and to examine risk factors for disease.In a prospective cohort study, 925 women had a gynaecological examination twice yearly-including colposcopy and tests for human papillomavirus DNA in cervicovaginal lavage-for a median follow-up of 3.2 years (IQR 0.98-4.87).Vulvovaginal and perianal condylomata acuminata or intraepithelial neoplasia were present in 30 (6%) of 481 HIV-1-positive and four (1%) of 437 HIV-1-negative women (p<0.0001) at enrollment. Women without lesions at enrollment were included in an incidence analysis. 33 (9%) of 385 HIV-1-positive and two (1%) of 341 HIV-1-negative women developed vulvovaginal or perianal lesions, resulting in an incidence of 2.6 and 0.16 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (relative risk 16, 95% CI 12.9-20.5; p < 0.0001). Risk factors for incident lesions included HIV-1 infection (p = 0.013), human papillomavirus infection (p=0.0013), lower CD4 T lymphocyte count (p = 0.0395), and history of frequent injection of drugs (p=0.0199).Our results suggest that HIV-1-positive women are at increased risk of development of invasive vulvar carcinoma. Thus, we recommend that, as part of every gynaecological examination, HIV-1-positive women should have a thorough inspection of the vulva and perianal region, and women with abnormalities-except for typical, exophytic condylomata acuminata-should undergo colposcopy and biopsy.",NA
2001,Lancet,Survival and recurrence after concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer of the uterine cervix: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The US National Cancer Institute alert in February, 1999, stated that concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be considered for all patients with cervical cancer. Our aim was to review the effects of chemoradiotherapy on overall and progression-free survival, local and distant control, and acute and late toxicity in patients with cervical cancer.With the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration, we did a systematic review of all known randomised controlled trials done between 1981 and 2000 (17 published, two unpublished) of chemoradiation for cervical cancer.The trials included 4580 randomised patients, and 2865-3611 patients (62-78%) were available for analysis. Cisplatin was the most common agent used. The findings suggest that chemoradiation improves overall survival (hazard ratio 0.71, p<0.0001), whether platinum was used (0.70, p<0.0001) or not (0.81, p=0.20). A greater beneficial effect was seen in trials that included a high proportion of stage I and II patients (p=0.009). An improvement in progression-free survival was also seen with chemoradiation (0.61, p<0.0001). Thus, the absolute benefit in progression-free and overall survival was 16% (95% CI 13-19) and 12% (8-16), respectively. A significant benefit of chemoradiation on both local (odds ratio 0.61, p<0.0001) and distant recurrence (0.57, p<0.0001) was also recorded. Grade 3 or 4 haematological (odds ratio 1.49-8.60) and gastrointestinal (2.22) toxicities were significantly greater in the concomitant chemoradiation group than the control group. There was insufficient data to establish whether late toxicity was increased in the concomitant chemoradiation group.Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival and reduces local and distant recurrence in selected patients with cervical cancer, which may give a cytotoxic and sensitisation effect.",NA
2001,Lancet,Natural history of cervical human papillomavirus infection in young women: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Laboratory and epidemiological research suggests an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We studied the natural history of incident cervical HPV infection and its relation to the development of CIN.We recruited 2011 women aged 15-19 years who had recently become sexually active. We took a cervical smear every 6 months and stored samples for virological analysis. We immediately referred all women with any cytological abnormality for colposcopic assessment, but postponed treatment until there was histological evidence of progression to high-grade CIN.In 1075 women who were cytologically normal and HPV negative at recruitment, the cumulative risk at 3 years of any HPV infection was 44% (95% CI 40-48): HPV 16 was the most common type. The cumulative risk at 3 years of detecting an HPV type not present in the first positive sample was 26% (20-32). 246 women had an abnormal smear during follow-up, of whom 28 progressed to high-grade CIN. The risk of high-grade CIN was greatest in women who tested positive for HPV 16 (risk ratio 8.5 [3.7-19.2]); this risk was maximum 6-12 months after first detection of HPV 16. All HPV types under consideration were associated with cytologically abnormal smears. Although abnormality was significantly less likely to be associated with low-viral-load samples, the cumulative risk at 3 years of a high-viral-load sample after a low-viral-load sample was 45% (95% CI 35-56). Five women who progressed to high-grade CIN consistently tested negative for HPV.Our findings suggest that attempts to exploit the association between cervical neoplasia and HPV infection to improve effectiveness of cervical screening programmes might be undermined by the limited inferences that can be drawn from the characterisation of a woman's HPV status at a single point in time, and the short lead time gained by its detection.",NA
2001,Lancet,Changing rates of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix in England.,"A recent analysis showed little or no effect of screening on the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix between 1971 and 1992. We have used additional data on cancers diagnosed in 1993-94 in England and up to 1997 in five English cancer registries to investigate more recent trends.After inputing the number of adenocarcinomas in women with unknown histology, we fitted an age-cohort model to 8062 adenocarcinomas of the cervix diagnosed in England between 1971 and 1987. Predictions from this model were applied to the more recent data on 5854 cases. Residual effects were plotted against year of diagnosis in each of four age-groups.We estimated the underlying risk of cervical adenocarcinoma to be 14 times (95% CI 11-19) greater in women born in the early 1960s than in cohorts born before 1935. An age-cohort model fitted the data for England well up to 1987, but substantially overestimated the numbers of adenocarcinomas in young women from 1990 onwards. In 1996-97 the incidence rate in women aged 25-54 years was less than 40% of that predicted from the age-cohort model.The substantial increase in cervical adenocarcinoma in recent years is largely a birth-cohort effect presumably associated with greater exposure to human papillomavirus after the sexual revolution in the 1960s.

2001,Lancet,Molecular quantification and mapping of lymph-node micrometastases in cervical cancer.,"A proportion of patients with cancer and lymph nodes negative on histology will develop recurrence. Reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is a highly sensitive method for detection of lymph-node micrometastases, but accurate quantitative assessment has been difficult.We studied primary tumours and 156 lymph nodes from 32 patients with cervical cancer (stage IA2, IB1, and IB2) and 32 lymph nodes from nine patients with benign disease. A fully quantitative, real-time RT-PCR assay was used to document absolute copy numbers of the epithelial marker cytokeratin 19. Primers and probe were designed not to amplify either of the two cytokeratin 19 pseudogenes.All primary tumours and histologically involved lymph nodes (six) had more than 106 copies of cytokeratin 19 mRNA per microg total RNA. Expression of cytokeratin 19 (up to 1.1 x 10(5) copies per microg RNA) was detected in 66 (44%) of 150 histologically uninvolved lymph nodes, and in nodes from 16 of 32 patients with cervical cancer. 15 of these 16 patients with evidence of micrometastases had the highest cytokeratin 19 transcription level in a first lymph-node drainage station (three obturator, six internal, and six external iliac node). Transcription of cytokeratin 19 was found at a low level in just one of 32 lymph nodes obtained from nine patients with benign disease. Median copy number of cytokeratin 19 transcription was significantly higher (>10(3) copies) in association with adverse prognostic features.The results suggest that about 50% of early-stage cervical cancers shed tumour cells to the pelvic lymph nodes. The amount of cytokeratin 19 expression was related to clinicopathological features. Further studies are required to document the clinical implications of molecular micrometastases.",NA
2000,Lancet,Relation between tissue structure and imposed electrical current flow in cervical neoplasia.,"When an electrical potential is applied to human tissue, the pattern of the resulting current flow is determined by the shapes, arrangements, and internal structure of the tissue cells. By measurement of the electrical current patterns over a range of frequencies, and use of an inverse modelling procedure, electrical variables describing the tissue structure can be calculated. We used this method to develop a screening technique for the detection of cervical precancers.We used a pencil probe (diameter 5 mm) to measure electrical impedance spectra from eight points on the cervix in 124 women with abnormal cervical smears. Variables that should be sensitive to the expected tissue changes were calculated. These were compared with the colposcopic results.The measured electrical impedance changes were those predicted on the basis of the expected tissue structures. Measurements made on normal squamous tissues were well separated from those made on precancerous tissues. We constructed receiver-operating-characteristic curves, comparing measurements made on normal tissue and that showing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3; the area under the curve was 0.951. These groups of women could be separated with a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.92.Characteristics of the electrical impedance spectra of tissues can be explained by changes in cell arrangements (layering) and in the size of the nuclei. This relation opens the way to deriving tissue structure from electrical impedance spectral measurements. We show that this approach can be used to give good separation of normal and precancerous cervical tissues.",NA
2000,Lancet,Consistent high viral load of human papillomavirus 16 and risk of cervical carcinoma in situ: a nested case-control study.,"Persistent infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is believed to be a prerequisite for the development of cervical neoplasia. Persistence may depend on certain characteristics, such as viral load, which has so far been given little attention. We investigated the association between HPV 16 viral load and cervical carcinoma in situ.We did a nested case-control study of women participating in cytological screening in Sweden. We used a sensitive quantitative PCR assay to estimate HPV 16 load in multiple smears for each woman, taken during a period of up to 26 years before diagnosis. We calculated C, values, which decrease as the number of viral DNA copies increases.2081 smears from 478 cases and 1754 smears from 608 controls were tested. Among cases, we found a consistently increased load of HPV 16 already 13 years or more before diagnosis, and when many smears were still cytologically normal. Women with high HPV 16 viral loads were at least 30 times the relative risk of HPV-16-negative women more than a decade before diagnosis. The increase in relative risk was constant over time. About 25% of women (95% CI 0.12-0.32) infected with a high viral load before age 25 years developed cervical carcinoma in situ within 15 years.Cervical carcinoma in situ associated with HPV 16 occurs mainly in HPV-16-positive women who have consistently high viral loads long term. Women at high risk could be identified by use of a quantitative HPV test in addition to cytological screening.",NA
2000,Lancet,Viral load of human papilloma virus 16 as a determinant for development of cervical carcinoma in situ: a nested case-control study.,"Infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is common among young women, increases the risk of cervical cancer. However, less than 1% of young women positive for oncogenic types of HPV develop cervical cancer. We investigated whether the amount of HPV DNA is a useful predictor of progression to cervical carcinoma in situ.We estimated the amount of HPV 16 DNA by a PCR that uses the 5'-exonuclease (Taqman) method, in 478 women with cervical carcinoma in situ and 608 individually matched controls. To adjust for differences in the amount of genomic DNA between samples, we estimated the amount of a nuclear gene (beta-actin). We studied multiple smears (total 3835 archived samples) from each woman, taken over periods of up to 26 years, that covered normal cytology to development of cervical cancer.The risk of cervical carcinoma in situ increased with the amount of HPV 16 DNA. Analysis of the first smear from each woman, collected a mean of 7.8 years before cancer diagnosis, showed that women with the 20% highest amount of HPV 16 DNA were at a 60-fold higher risk of developing cervical carcinoma in situ than women negative for HPV 16. The first smear samples were classified as normal by squamous-cell cytology.Analysis of the amount of HPV DNA can predict cancer risk at a stage when current screening methods are uninformative. Testing for the amount of HPV 16 DNA during gynaecological health checks might strikingly improve our ability to distinguish between infections that have a high or low risk of progressing into cervical cancer.",NA
2000,Lancet,"Comparison of radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia in locally advanced pelvic tumours: a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial. Dutch Deep Hyperthermia Group.","Local-control rates after radiotherapy for locally advanced tumours of the bladder, cervix, and rectum are disappointing. We investigated the effect of adding hyperthermia to standard radiotherapy.The study was a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial. 358 patients were enrolled from 1990 to 1996, in cancer centres in the Netherlands, who had bladder cancer stages T2, T3, or T4, NO, MO, cervical cancer stages IIB, IIIB, or IV, or rectal cancer stage M0-1 were assessed. Patients were randomly assigned radiotherapy (median total dose 65 Gy) alone (n=176) or radiotherapy plus hyperthermia (n=182). Our primary endpoints were complete response and duration of local control. We did the analysis by intention to treat.Complete-response rates were 39% after radiotherapy and 55% after radiotherapy plus hyperthermia (p<0.001). The duration of local control was significantly longer with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia than with radiotherapy alone (p=0.04). Treatment effect did not differ significantly by tumour site, but the addition of hyperthermia seemed to be most important for cervical cancer, for which the complete-response rate with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia was 83% compared with 57% after radiotherapy alone (p=0.003). 3-year overall survival was 27% in the radiotherapy group and 51% in the radiotherapy plus hyperthermia group. For bladder cancer, an initial difference in local control disappeared during follow-up.Hyperthermia in addition to standard radiotherapy may be especially useful in locally advanced cervical tumours. Studies of larger numbers of patients are needed for other pelvic tumour sites before practical recommendations can be made.",NA
1999,Lancet,Efficacy of cervical-smear collection devices: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Few randomised controlled trials have sufficient power to show clear advantages of different designs of cervical-smear collection devices. We studied by systematic review whether the design of cervical-smear devices affects rates of inadequate smears and detection of disease and whether the presence of endocervical cells in the smear affects detection of disease.We sought relevant randomised controlled trials by computer literature review by MEDLINE backed up by a manual search of 16 journals. Each trial was classified according to methodological quality criteria. Odds ratios were calculated where data allowed.34 randomised controlled trials investigating cervical Papanicolaou smear collection devices were identified. All 34 trials compared the ability of devices to collect endocervical cells, and 19 compared the ability of devices to detect dyskaryosis. Meta-analyses showed that compared with other collection devices, the Ayre's spatula is an ineffective device for collecting endocervical cells (for example, odds ratio for comparison of extended-tip spatulas vs Ayre's spatula 2.25 [95% CI 2.06-2.44]) and also gives a lower yield of dyskaryosis (odds ratio for comparison of extended-tip spatulas vs Ayre's spatula 1.21 [1.20-1.33]). Devices that effectively collect endocervical cells also detect a higher proportion of abnormal cytology than those that do not.The widely used Ayre's spatula is the least effective device for cervical sampling and should be superseded by extended-tip spatulas for primary screening and investigation of women before and after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The presence of endocervical cells is a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis.",NA
1999,Lancet,Relation of human papillomavirus status to cervical lesions and consequences for cervical-cancer screening: a prospective study.,"A relation has been established between infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus and development of cervical cancer. We investigated a role for testing for human papillomavirus as part of cervical-cancer screening.We monitored by cytology, colposcopy, and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus 353 women referred to gynaecologists with mild to moderate and severe dyskaryosis. The median follow-up time was 33 months. At the last visit we took biopsy samples. Our primary endpoint was clinical progression, defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3, covering three or more cervical quadrants on colposcopy, or a cervical-smear result of suspected cervical cancer.33 women reached clinical progression. All had persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus. The cumulative 6-year incidence of clinical progression among these women was 40% (95% CI 21-59). In women with end histology CIN 3, 98 (95%) of 103 had persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus from baseline. Among women with mild to moderate dyskaryosis at baseline, a second test for human papillomavirus at 6 months predicted end histology CIN 3 better than a second cervical smear.Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus is necessary for development and maintenance of CIN 3. All women with severe dyskaryosis should be referred to gynaecologists, whereas women with mild to moderate dyskaryosis should be referred only after a second positive test for high-risk human papillomavirus at 6 months.",NA
1999,Lancet,Assessment of automated primary screening on PAPNET of cervical smears in the PRISMATIC trial. PRISMATIC Project Management Team.,"New technology for computer-assisted screening of cervical smears that uses neural networks could potentially decrease numbers of screening errors and improve productivity. We assessed an interactive automated system (PAPNET) for primary screening of cervical smears.In January, 1997, the National Health Service research and development programme sponsored a multicentre trial to investigate the use of PAPNET for classification of routine cervical smears as negative or needing further microscopic review. compared with conventional primary screening. The study complied with international standards for assessment of automated cervical screening systems. 21,700 smears were analysed by the two methods and were classified as inadequate, negative, mild, moderate, or severe dyskaryosis, invasion, glandular neoplasia, and borderline nuclear changes. 2906 abnormal smears and 298 negative smears were sent for independent cytological review (gold standard). We calculated sensitivity and specificity relative to the findings of the independent review.Agreement of 89.8% between the two methods was shown for all classifications of smears that were adequate for reporting. The sensitivity was similar for correctly identified abnormal smears on PAPNET-assisted (82%) and conventional screening (83%). PAPNET-assisted screening showed significantly better specificity (77%) than conventional screening (42%) for identification of negative smears. The total mean time for screening and reporting for conventional screening was 10.4 min per smear, and for PAPNET-assisted screening was 3.9 min.Use of PAPNET-assisted screening could increase quality and productivity. We recommend carefully organised and controlled development projects for the introduction of PAPNET-assisted primary screening of cervical smears.",NA
1999,Lancet,Visual inspection with acetic acid for cervical-cancer screening: test qualities in a primary-care setting. University of Zimbabwe/JHPIEGO Cervical Cancer Project.,"Naked-eye visual inspection of the cervix with acetic-acid wash (VIA), or cervicoscopy, is an alternative to cytology in screening for cervical cancer in poorly resourced locations. We tested the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of VIA done by nurse-midwives in a less-developed country.Women were screened by six trained nurse-midwives in a two-phase, cross-sectional study at 15 primary-care clinics in Zimbabwe. VIA and Pap smears were done concurrently, and their sensitivity and specificity compared. Colposcopy, with biopsy as indicated, was used as the reference test to allow a direct comparison of the test unaffected by verification bias.10934 women were screened. In phase II, 2148 (97.5%) of the 2203 participants for whom there was a screening result also had a reference test result. Also in phase II, VIA was more sensitive but less specific than cytology. Sensitivity (95% CI) was 76.7% (70.3-82.3) for VIA and 44.3% (37.3-51.4) for cytology. Specificity was 64.1% (61.9-66.2) for VIA and 90.6% (89.2-91.9) for cytology.The high sensitivity of VIA shows that the test could be valuable in detection of precancerous lesions of the cervix. However, there are costs to the patient and system costs associated with high numbers of false-positive results, so attention should be given to improving the specificity of VIA.",NA
1998,Lancet,p53 codon 72 polymorphism and risk of cervical cancer in UK.,"A polymorphism at codon 72 of the human tumour-suppressor gene, p53, results in translation to either arginine or proline. A recent report suggested that the risk of human-papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer in white women is higher for those homozygous for the arginine allele than for those who are heterozygous. We examined a similar number of cervical cancers and a larger control group for their p53 codon 72 polymorphism status to see if we could confirm this result.Three different groups of UK white women were studied: 96 who had volunteered to take part in a trial of ovarian-cancer screening; 150 attending for routine antenatal care in the Oxford region; and 50 women with cervical cancer. DNA from peripheral blood samples and from archival tissue samples was examined by PCR with allele-specific primers.The proportions of individuals homozygous for the arginine allele, homozygous for the proline allele, and heterozygous for the two alleles were 59%, 4%, and 36% among women screened for ovarian cancer; 65%, 8%, and 27% among the antenatal-care group; and 54%, 6%, and 40% in women with cervical cancer. Chi2 analysis showed no significant differences in these proportions.In the population studied, individuals homozygous for the arginine variant of codon 72 of the p53 gene were not at increased risk of cervical cancer.",NA
1997,Lancet,Randomised study of radical surgery versus radiotherapy for stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer.,"Stage Ib and IIa cervical carcinoma can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy. These two procedures are equally effective, but differ in associated morbidity and type of complications. In this prospective randomised trial of radiotherapy versus surgery, our aim was to assess the 5-year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each treatment.Between September, 1986, and December, 1991, 469 women with newly diagnosed stage Ib and IIa cervical carcinoma were referred to our institute. 343 eligible patients were randomised: 172 to surgery and 171 to radical radiotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered after surgery for women with surgical stage pT2b or greater, less than 3 mm of safe cervical stroma, cut-through, or positive nodes. The primary outcome measures were 5-year survival and the rate of complications. The analysis of survival and recurrence was by intention to treat and analysis of complications was by treatment delivered.170 patients in the surgery group and 167 in the radiotherapy group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; scheduled treatment was delivered to 169 and 158 women, respectively, 62 of 114 women with cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller and 46 of 55 with diameters larger than 4 cm received adjuvant therapy. After a median follow-up of 87 (range 57-120) months, 5-year overall and disease-free survival were identical in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (83% and 74%, respectively, for both groups), 86 women developed recurrent disease: 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group. Significant factors for survival in univariate and multivariate analyses were: cervical diameter, positive lymphangiography, and adeno-carcinomatous histotype. 48 (28%) surgery-group patients had severe morbidity compared with 19 (12%) radiotherapy-group patients (p = 0.0004).There is no treatment of choice for early-stage cervical carcinoma in terms of overall or disease-free survival. The combination of surgery and radiotherapy has the worst morbidity, especially urological complications. The optimum therapy for each patient should take account of clinical factors such as menopausal status, age, medical illness, histological type, and cervical diameter to yield the best cure with minimum complications.",NA
1997,Lancet,Invasive cervical cancer after conservative therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Conservative outpatient therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) by ablative or excisional techniques is widely used. The main objective of this treatment is the prevention of invasive cervical cancer. We assessed the rate of invasive disease and the duration of the risk of developing invasive cervical cancer after such treatment.Four UK centres have used life-table methods to analyse the long-term results of conservative treatment of CIN. We combined and updated data from these studies to investigate the rate of invasive disease after treatment and the duration of that risk.The data comprised 44 699 woman-years of follow-up, with 2116 women under observation 8 years after treatment. 33 women developed invasive cancer, 14 of whom had microinvasion. The cumulative rate of invasion 8 years after treatment was 5.8 per 1000 women and the rate of invasive cancer during this period was 85 (95% CI 60-119) per 100,000 woman-years. The risk of developing cancer did not change throughout the 8 years of follow-up.These data show that conservative outpatient therapy in women with CIN reduces the risk of invasive cancer of the cervix by 95% during the first 8 years after treatment. However, even with careful, long-term follow-up, the risk of invasive cervical cancer among these women is about five times greater than that among the general population of women throughout that period. Careful follow-up is essential for at least 10 years after conservative treatment of CIN.",NA
1996,Lancet,HIV infection and neoplasia.,"HIV infection predisposes to several neoplastic conditions, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and also intraepithelial cervical neoplasia (CIN) and anal neoplasia (AIN) (but not cervical or anal invasive cancer) and possibly seminoma. For neoplasias associated with oncogenic human viruses (ie, some NHL, CIN, AIN, and probably KS) the role of HIV is most probably linked to its immunosuppressive effect and interference with immune-mediated tumour surveillance. HIV-1, through its regulatory protein tat, might also have a direct promoting effect on KS lesions but it is not essential for their development. The increased frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma and Epstein-Barr-virus-negative large-cell lymphoma in AIDS patients, but not in immunosuppressed transplant patients, and the increased rate of testicular tumours in HIV-infected individuals remain unexplained and may indicate either a direct role for HIV or other cofactors.",NA
1996,Lancet,"A recombinant vaccinia virus encoding human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, E6 and E7 proteins as immunotherapy for cervical cancer.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially with type 16 or 18, is associated with cervical cancer. Two HPV proteins, E6 and E7, are consistently expressed in tumour cells. The objectives of the study were to examine the clinical and environmental safety and immunogenicity in the first clinical trial of a live recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the E6 and E7 proteins of HPV 16 and 18 (TA-HPV).The study was an open label phase I/II trial in eight patients with late stage cervical cancer. The patients were vaccinated with a single dose of TA-HPV and kept in strict isolation to monitor local and systemic side-effects, environmental spread, and anti-E6/E7 immune responses.Vaccination resulted in no significant clinical side-effects and there was no environmental contamination by live TA-HPV. Each patient mounted an antivaccinia antibody response and three of the eight patients developed an HPV-specific antibody response that could be ascribed to the vaccination. HPV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the effector mechanism most likely to be of therapeutic benefit, were detected in one of three evaluable patients.Further studies to investigate the use ot TA-HPV for immunotherapy of cervical cancer are warranted.",NA
1996,Lancet,Effect of smoking cessation on cervical lesion size.,"Cigarette smoking has been postulated as a cofactor in the aetiology of cervical cancer, but a causal role is difficult to establish because of potential confounding by sexual behaviour. We have investigated the effect of cessation or reduction of cigarette smoking on the course of minor-grade cervical lesions.In this intervention study 82 women volunteers with minor-grade lesions on colposcopy (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 or less) attempted to give up smoking for 6 months. Smoking histories were taken at 3-monthly clinic visits and verified by measurement of salivary cotinine concentrations. At each clinic visit, a photograph of the cervix was taken; the image was digitised and computer-aided image analysis was used to assess lesion size, by investigators unaware of smoking status.Of the 82 women, 17 stopped smoking completely for at least 6 months and 11 others reduced their smoking consumption by more than 75%. Of these 28 women, 23 (82%) showed a reduction in lesion size of at least 20% or 4 mm2 compared with 13 (28%) of the 47 non-quitters (odds ratio 12.0 [95% Cl 3.9-32.7]). The remaining seven women had unconfirmed smoking histories. There was a significant correlation between the extent of smoking reduction and the change in lesion size (chi2 for trend=31.55, p<0.0001). Adjustment for social class, method of contraception, and stage of menstrual cycle did not affect the results.Our findings support a link between smoking and cervical disease and suggest that smoking cessation could have a beneficial effect on early cervical abnormalities.",NA
1995,Lancet,Human papillomavirus testing in primary cervical screening.,"Several studies have examined the role of tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) in screening for cervical cancer but as yet the relevance is unclear. We looked at HPV testing for types 16, 18, 31, and 33 on material taken at the time of a cervical smear in 2009 eligible women having routine screening. Women with any degree of dyskaryosis or high levels of one of these HPV types were referred for colposcopy. 44% of the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions of grade 2/3 detected had negative cytology and were found only by HPV testing. A further 22% of the CIN 2/3 lesions were positive for HPV but showed only borderline or mild cytological changes. The positive predictive value of HPV testing was 42%, which was similar to that for moderate dyskaryosis. HPV types 16 and 31 were more sensitive and specific for CIN 2/3 than were types 18 or 33. However, 25% of the CIN 2/3 lesions were not detected by these four HPV tests. We suggest that HPV testing could usefully augment but not replace conventional cytology. These results should stimulate a much larger randomised trial to assess the impact of these improved CIN 2/3 detection rates on the subsequent incidence of invasive cancer.",NA
1995,Lancet,Detection rates for abnormal cervical smears: what are we screening for?,"We analysed rates of detection for smear abnormalities in 255,000 women served by the Bristol screening programme. The programme began in 1966 with the aim of eradicating the 30-40 deaths each year in Bristol from cervical cancer. Organisation has been good and population uptake has been high for the past 15 years. Records were computerised in 1977. During the 1988 to 1993 screening round, 225,974 women were tested. New smear abnormalities were found in 15,551, of whom nearly 6000 were referred for colposcopy. These numbers are excessively high in comparison with the incidence of the malignancy we are trying to prevent. The effect of screening on death rates in Bristol is too small to detect. Our conclusion is that despite good organisation of the service, much of our effort in Bristol is devoted to limiting the harm done to healthy women and to protecting our staff from litigation as cases of serious disease continue to occur. The real lesson from 30 years' cervical screening is that no matter how obvious the predicted benefit may seem for any screening test, introduction should never take place without adequate prior evaluation of both positive and negative effects in controlled trials.",NA
1994,Lancet,Oral contraceptive use and adenocarcinoma of cervix.,"The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix in the USA more than doubled between the early 1970s and the mid 1980s among women under 35 years of age. It was suggested that this increase was due to the introduction of oral contraceptives in the early 1960s. Adenocarcinoma of the cervix diagnosed in women born after 1935 was identified between 1977 and 1991 from the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program. Data from personal interviews of 195 cases and 386 controls (matched on age, race, and neighbourhood) were analysed. Information on medical, sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive history, previous cervical smears, and sexually transmitted diseases was collected. Compared with never use, ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with twice as great a risk of adenocarcinoma of the cervix (adjusted odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8). The highest risk was observed for oral contraceptive use for more than 12 years (4.4, 1.8-10.8). No additional increased risk was found for early age at start of oral contraceptive use, use before age 20 or before first pregnancy, time since first use, time since last use, or particular formulations, once total duration of use had been accounted for.",NA
1994,Lancet,Relation between human papillomavirus type 16 and potential for progression of minor-grade cervical disease.,"We have previously reported that among 200 women referred for colposcopy with smears suggesting mild dyskaryosis, medium or high copy numbers of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA identified patients with current high-grade cervical disease. We have followed up 95 women from that group who had histologically proven mild-grade cervical disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1, n = 37) or wart virus infection (n = 12) or who had no evidence of cervical abnormality at study entry (n = 43). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the 70 months' follow-up was used to identify baseline features that might affect the risk of progression. 3 women were lost to follow-up; data were available for the remaining 92. Among the whole group the probability of remaining free of high-grade cervical disease was 0.71. Women with a histological diagnosis of minor-grade disease were more likely to progress to high-grade disease than those with no evidence of abnormality (proportion disease-free 0.52 vs 0.90, p = 0.004). Stratification of the group according to median age (28 years) revealed a weak association between age and disease progression (p = 0.04). There was no difference in disease-free probability between HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative women (0.75 vs 0.65, p = 0.19). Nor was there a significant difference in disease-free probability when the group was stratified by HPV16 viral burden. These data show that a histological diagnosis of minor-grade cervical disease is a better long-term predictor of disease progression than is HPV16 positivity, irrespective of copy number. These findings do not support the simple view that HPV16 alone is the cause of high-grade cervical disease, including cancer.",NA
1994,Lancet,Long-term neoplasia risk after azathioprine treatment in inflammatory bowel disease.,"The incidence of various cancers, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is higher among patients who receive azathioprine for immunosuppression after organ transplants than in the general population. We have studied the risk of neoplasia after azathioprine in 755 patients treated for inflammatory bowel disease. The patients received 2 mg/kg daily for a median of 12.5 months (range 2 days to 15 years) between 1962 and 1991; median follow-up was 9 years (range 2 weeks to 29 years). Overall there was no significant excess of cancer: 31 azathioprine-treated patients developed cancer before age 85 compared with 24.3 expected from rates in the general population (observed/expected ratio 1.27, p = 0.186). There was a difference in the frequency of colorectal (13) and anal (2) carcinomas (expected 2.27; ratio 6.7, p = 0.00001); these tumours are recognised complications of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. There were 2 cases of invasive cervical cancer (expected 0.5), but no case of NHL. Among patients with extensive chronic ulcerative colitis there was no difference in cancer frequency between 86 who had received azathioprine and 180 matched patients who had never received it. Thus, azathioprine treatment does not substantially increase the risk of cancer in inflammatory bowel disease.",NA
1994,Lancet,Disrupted dichotomous intracellular control of human papillomavirus infection in cancer of the cervix.,"The role of specific human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in the aetiology of cancer of the cervix is firmly established. Progression of an HPV-infected cell clone to invasive growth involves consecutive modifications of a set of host cell genes. Some of these modifications suppress viral oncogene functions post-transcriptionally, and others suppress transcription via a signalling pathway stimulated by activated macrophages and possibly by additional cells. I describe a scheme that tries to unify available data by postulating the existence of two intracellular signalling pathways in the control of latent HPV infections.",NA
1994,Lancet,Efficacy and safety of large-loop excision of the transformation zone.,"Large-loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) has become a popular treatment for women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) before long-term effectiveness and safety have been fully evaluated. Women who took part in a 1990 study of the procedure have been followed-up by cervical cytology for longer than 2 years. The rate of recurrences and residual lesions was 5.0% in the first year and 0.6% in the second year. LLETZ was also effective when used as a repeat procedure, although the negative histology rate was much higher (4.7% for initial procedures and 20% for repeat procedures). 250 women from the original study group of 1000 answered a questionnaire on fertility and menstrual symptoms 3 years after LLETZ. We found no differences between these women and controls of the same age, living in the same geographical area, with a history of negative cervical smears. LLETZ is a safe and effective procedure with no effect on menstruation or fertility.",NA
1993,Lancet,Decision analysis for best management of mildly dyskaryotic smear.,"Should a woman with a mildly dyskaryotic cervical smear be referred for colposcopy or should the smear be repeated? One way to answer this question is to use decision analysis and compare the expected mortality and cost of each policy. Data for each component of the question were obtained from published work worldwide and were supplemented with an audit of mildly dyskaryotic smears in West Yorkshire, UK. 2 out of 1000 women with an initial mildly dyskaryotic smear will develop cancer if a conservative repeat smear policy is adopted in association with five-yearly cervical screening. This number can be reduced to 1.6 per 1000 if cervical screening is offered every three years. A policy of immediate referral for colposcopy is also associated with a subsequent cancer rate of 1.6 per 1000. Therefore, repeating the smear is almost as effective as an immediate referral to a colposcopy unit. Even if a five-yearly cervical screening programme is adopted, 2500 women with a mildly dyskaryotic smear will need to be referred for immediate colposcopy to save 1 additional cancer. A conservative policy is not financially cheaper: an average of six additional smears is required to save each colposcopy referral. Sensitivity analysis shows that the excess cost of the conservative policy increases exponentially as the risk of a subsequent cytological abnormality exceeds 60%. Local cytopathology laboratories should audit their recurrent dyskaryosis rate associated with borderline, mild, and moderate dyskaryosis before accepting the U-turn in the national recommendations.",NA
1993,Lancet,Antibodies to human papillomavirus and to other genital infectious agents and invasive cervical cancer risk.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) play an important part in the development of cervical cancer, but the role of other infectious agents, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), is not clear. We assayed serum samples collected from 219 women with cervical cancer and from 387 controls for antibody to infectious agents. HPV 16-E7 and/or HPV 18-E7 antibodies were significantly related to cervical cancer risk (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.2). Antibodies to HSV types 1 and 2, Chlamydia trachomatis, and to multiple infectious agents were associated with cervical cancer when seroprevalence rates in all cases and controls were compared, but when HPV-seropositive cases and controls were compared these associations were weaker and non-significant. This finding suggests that past infections with sexually transmitted infections other than HPV may be surrogate markers of exposure to HPV, and of no separate aetiological significance.",NA
1993,Lancet,Prevention of colorectal cancer by once-only sigmoidoscopy.,"There is no national screening programme for colorectal cancer in the UK despite the fact that the annual death toll from this disease exceeds that of breast and cervical cancer. Faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is under evaluation for screening, but screening by sigmoidoscopy is not considered viable. This situation contrasts with the USA where both annual FOBT and screening by flexible sigmoidoscopy every 3 to 5 years are recommended from 50 years old. We seek to demonstrate that most of the benefit from the US screening policy would accrue from a single flexible sigmoidoscopy examination at age 55 to 60 years with appropriate colonoscopic surveillance for the 3% to 5% found to have high-risk adenomas (> or = 1 cm or villous histology). If applied nationally, this screening regimen could prevent about 5500 colorectal cancer cases and 3500 deaths in the UK each year, thus saving 40,000 years of life. We estimate that there would be little net cost to the National Health Service because savings obtained from treating fewer patients would largely offset the cost of screening. We recommend that a randomised trial to evaluate screening by single flexible sigmoidoscopy should start without delay. Such a trial would involve about 120,000 participants, and 15 years of follow-up would be required to obtain a clear answer on mortality, although information on incidence reduction would be available sooner.",NA
1992,Lancet,Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: part of a multifocal disease process.,"Invasive carcinomas of the anogenital epithelium share a common aetiological factor--human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16. Although genital intraepithelial neoplasia may be multifocal, there have been no studies of the prevalence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia in women with intraepithelial neoplasia of the genital tract. We tested the hypothesis that women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are at higher risk of disease in the anus than are control women of similar age with no history of anogenital neoplasia. 29 (19%) of 152 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III had histological evidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia. Of the 29 patients, 11 had grade III anal lesions; 2 of those women had concomitant invasive anal squamous-cell carcinomas. Only 7% (8/115) women with high-grade lesions of the cervix alone had evidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia; by contrast, 57% (21/37) of those with more than one focus of intraepithelial neoplasia (cervix plus vulva, vagina, or both) had anal lesions. HPV 16 DNA was identified in 18 (51%) of 35 anal biopsy samples in the study group. No evidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia was found in the control group (50 women), although 2 patients had grade I cervical lesions. HPV 16 DNA was identified in 12 (24%) of biopsy samples from the cervix and 7 (14%) from the anus in the control group; all 7 women with anal HPV 16 had concomitant cervical infection. The role of anal examination in the assessment of women with any focus of genital intraepithelial neoplasia requires further investigation.",NA
1992,Lancet,Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17p and mutant p53 in HPV-negative cervical carcinomas.,"Inactivation of the protein product of the wild-type tumour suppressor gene p53 through complexing of the protein with the E6 oncoprotein of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in HPV-infected cells is thought to be important in the aetiology of cervical carcinoma. Mutations of p53 have also been reported in HPV-negative carcinomas, and we now demonstrate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome region 17p13 (in which p53 is located) in such tumours. Immunocytochemical staining with monoclonal antimutant-p53 antibody revealed that the carcinomas with LOH on 17p and completely lacking HPV DNA sequences had mutant p53. Thus the LOH had apparently resulted in the loss of the wild-type allele. Consequently, in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumours there is loss of function of wild-type p53, in the former because the protein product of the p53 gene complexes with that of the viral E6 gene, in the latter because the protein is altered, presumably as a result of a direct alteration of the p53 gene but possibly because of other post-translational changes. That this mutant allele of the tumour suppressor gene may sometimes behave like an oncogene is suggested by the presence of more than the expected number of copies of the remaining chromosome 17 homologue in some carcinomas.",NA
1992,Lancet,Mild cervical dyskaryosis: safety of cytological surveillance.,"How best to manage women who are found on cervical screening to have mild dyskaryosis remains controversial. Cytological surveillance misses some lesions picked up by colposcopy, but colposcopy is emotionally traumatic for women, the majority of whom will have a normal result. To determine what proportion of lesions are missed by cytological surveillance, and whether any abnormalities persist after colposcopy, we studied, by means of colposcopy and biopsy, the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and subclinical human papillomavirus infection (HPVI) in two groups of patients who had had a first smear showing mild dyskaryosis at least 24 months earlier. One group was recruited from a centre practising cytological surveillance, with colposcopy for patients showing persistent or progressive cytological abnormality. The other group all had early colposcopy and treatment. Of 214 patients recruited into the cytological surveillance group, 70 (33%) had been referred for colposcopy within 24 months. Colposcopy of the remaining 144 (after a mean interval of 27 months from presentation) revealed that 54 (38%) were disease free, 64 (44%) had HPVI/CIN1, 8 (6%) had CIN2, and 18 (12%) had CIN3. A smear at that time identified 12 of the 18 (67%) with CIN3 as needing close cytological follow-up (1 patient) or prompt referral for colposcopy (11 patients). 137 women in the early colposcopy group attended for the study colposcopy (after a mean interval of 32 months from presentation). 37% were found to have some abnormality persisting after an earlier colposcopy, but none had CIN3. Cytological surveillance of mild dyskaryosis resulted in a 12% risk of patients having a small CIN3 lesion after 2 years, but this risk was reduced to 4% by the addition of a third repeat smear 12 months after the second. With such a policy only about a third of women would require colposcopy, and the risk of missing serious underlying precancerous changes would be low.",NA
1992,Lancet,Clonal p53 mutation in primary cervical cancer: association with human-papillomavirus-negative tumours.,"Analyses of cancer cell lines and of anal cancers suggest an inverse correlation between infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and somatic mutation of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene. We have investigated this association in primary cervical tumours. Tumour-tissue samples from 28 women with primary cancer of the cervix were analysed for presence of HPV sequences and for somatic mutations of the p53 gene. Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that 25 of the tumours contained HPV sequences; 20 were HPV16 positive and 5 HPV18 positive. 17 tumours subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for the short arm of chromosome 17 showed no evidence of allelic deletion. Sequencing of the entire coding region of the p53 gene by asymmetric PCR detected heterozygous point mutations in only 3 HPV-negative tumours. By contrast, in 21 HPV-positive cancers the p53 sequence was wild-type throughout. Our data indicate that loss of wild-type p53 function is important in the pathology of cervical cancer and that in the absence of an HPV-encoded gene product that mediates loss of p53 function, somatic mutation of the gene is required. This pattern of p53 mutation may partly explain the apparently worse prognosis of HPV-negative cervical cancers.",NA
1992,Lancet,Human papillomavirus type 16 in cervical smears as predictor of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [corrected].,"The management of women with mild to moderately dyskaryotic cervical smears would benefit from a non-invasive test that predicts which women have high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Detection of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA in cervical smears may be such a test. With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we estimated the amount of HPV16 DNA in cervical smears from 85 women referred for colposcopy because of abnormal cytology. An intermediate or high amount of HPV16 DNA predicted the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a subsequent biopsy in almost 90% of patients irrespective of the cytological grade of the referral smear. This technique may allow early identification of those women with low-grade cytological abnormalities who have high-grade underlying cervical disease.",NA
1991,Lancet,Increased age and mortality associated with cervical carcinomas negative for human papillomavirus RNA.,"Attempts to relate presence and type of human papillomavirus in cervical carcinoma with prognosis have yielded conflicting results. To further investigate this relation, the association between survival of cervical cancer patients after diagnosis and the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) RNA within the tumour was assessed retrospectively. Formalin-fixed biopsy specimens from 212 patients with cervical carcinoma who had been followed for up to 6 years were tested by in-situ hybridisation with 125I-labelled riboprobes. HPV-RNA-positive women were 11.9 years younger than HPV-negative women at diagnosis (p less than 0.001). Case-fatality rates from cervical cancer rose with absence of HPV RNA, age at diagnosis, or FIGO stage. Multivariate analysis confirmed that absence of detectable HPV RNA and advanced FIGO stage were independent risk factors. No differences in survival between HPV types 16, 18, 31, or 33 were seen. These observations suggest that cervical carcinoma patients fall into two groups--a younger, HPV-RNA-positive group, with a better prognosis, and an older, HPV-RNA-negative group with poorer prognosis. Treatment regimens for the two groups may need to differ.",NA
1991,Lancet,Aetiological parallel between anal cancer and cervical cancer.,"It has been postulated that an infectious agent and/or specific sexual behaviour is involved in the aetiology of anal cancer, in analogy with the aetiology established for cancer of the cervix. A case-control study of 29,648 women with cancers registered in the Danish Cancer Registry during 1968-87 tested the hypothesis that anal cancer patients were more likely than patients with colon, stomach, or vulva cancer to have had a previous diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer. The odds ratio of CIN, adjusted for age and year of diagnosis, for anal vs colon cancer was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.3-8.3), that for anal vs stomach cancer 3.6 (2.1-6.0), and that for anal vs vulva cancer 1.6 (0.9-2.9). The median time from diagnosis of CIN to diagnosis of the registered cancer was 151 months for anal, 112 months for vulva, 114 months for colon, and 126 months for stomach cancer. The association with previous invasive cervical cancer was also investigated; no patient with cervical cancer in this second analysis had been included in the CIN analysis. The odds ratios were similar. In addition, anal cancer patients were significantly more likely to have had cervical cancer than were patients with vulva cancer (odds ratio 1.8 [1.0-3.9]). The strong association between anal cancer and CIN/invasive cervical cancer suggests that these cancers share common risk factors. The association is at least as strong as that between cervical and vulva cancer.",NA
1991,Lancet,Screening for cervical cancer by direct inspection.,"Since cytology-based screening programmes for cervical cancer cannot be provided on a large scale in developing countries, an alternative approach is needed. To find out whether visual inspection of the cervix is an adequate alternative, women with cytological evidence of dysplasia were followed up cytologically and colposcopically until cancer was detected, and the gross appearance of the cervix was recorded at each stage. Although only 40-50% of cancers were accompanied by abnormal-looking cervices, whereas 71% were detectable on cytology and 87% on colposcopy, visual inspection may be useful in areas where cytological screening programmes are not available.",NA
1991,Lancet,Oncogene expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cancer of cervix.,"Expression of the oncogenes Ha-RAS, c-MYC, and ERB-2 was investigated with an automated image analysis system in 12 specimens of normal cervix, 10 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1, 24 of CIN 3, and 10 of invasive cancer of the cervix. There was amplification of all three oncogenes in CIN 3 and invasive cancer compared with normal cervix and CIN 1. The difference was most pronounced with an antibody to the RAS p21 protein, with no overlap between CIN 3 and the normal range. This method might be useful in screening for cervical neoplasia, and for the determination of which CIN lesions require treatment.",NA
1991,Lancet,Lymphoscintigraphy with 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor.,We have used 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor (EGF) scans to study 14 patients with advanced cervical cancer. Abnormal lymph node imaging was seen most clearly 6-8 h after the injection and revealed abnormal uptake by pelvic lymph nodes in 11 patients. 4 of these 11 had abnormal computerised tomographic and ultrasound scans; in the other 7 conventional radiology did not confirm the presence of disease.,NA
1991,Lancet,Longitudinal study of women with negative cervical smears according to endocervical status.,"A longitudinal study of 20,222 women who received negative cervical smear reports in 1987 showed that the incidence of definite or equivocal cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was not significantly different between those whose first smear lacked an endocervical component and those whose smear included an endocervical component. The incidence of definite cytological evidence of CIN was significantly lower in women whose first smear did not include an endocervical component. It is concluded that women whose smears are reported as negative but lack an endocervical component should not be rescreened any earlier than women with negative smears that include an endocervical component.",NA
1990,Lancet,Association between poor prognosis in early-stage invasive cervical carcinomas and non-detection of HPV DNA.,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA sequences (HPV types 16, 18, 33, 35 or uncharacterized) were detected by Southern blot hybridisation and polymerase chain reaction in 84% of 106 early-stage invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Among HPV-positive patients, the risk of overall relapse did not differ with individual HPV types. Compared with HPV-positive patients, those with no detectable HPV DNA had a 2.6 times higher risk of overall relapse (p less than 0.05) and 4.5 times higher risk of distant metastases (p less than 0.01). The 24-month relapse-free survival rate in HPV-positive patients was significantly higher than that in HPV-negative patients (77% vs 40%), and the difference was similar (91% vs 56%) among those who were node-negative. These data indicate that HPV-negative cervical carcinomas may represent a biologically distinct subset of tumours that carry a poorer prognosis than do HPV-positive cancers.",NA
1990,Lancet,First coitus before menarche and risk of sexually transmitted disease.,"The prevalence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and cervical cancer, and the relation between these conditions were studied in 2111 Ethiopian women. Early sexual activity was associated with an increase in prevalence rates of STD and PID; possible aetiological factors include physical and immunological immaturity of the female genital tract and the number of sexual partners.",NA
1990,Lancet,Screening for cancer of the cervix in elderly women.,"A substantial proportion of women aged over 65 years has not been screened for cancer of the cervix and women in this age group are not included in current screening programmes. This policy is not supported by evidence from the natural history of preinvasive lesions. Since older women present with late disease (and therefore have a poor survival) 5-year survival rates adjusted for stage were used to estimate the reduction in number of deaths in women aged 20 years or older (during a 5-year period) if opportunistic screening were to identify more cases of cervical cancer at an earlier stage. 353 lives would be saved and women older than 65 would benefit most, with a 63% improvement in 5-year mortality. Thus, there is no reason to exclude women aged over 65 years from screening for cancer of the cervix.",NA
1989,Lancet,Anal and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: possible parallel.,"This study evaluated prospectively the use of an endoscope in examination of the anal canal for the detection of premalignant lesions. All patients underwent endoscopy and anal epithelial biopsy; the biopsy samples were examined histologically and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA hybridisation was done. No evidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) was found in 20 control patients with anal fissure or fistula. Of 82 patients with anal HPV infection, 23 had evidence of AIN. The prevalence of AIN was significantly higher among homosexual than among heterosexual men (17 of 28 vs 1 of 26) with anal HPV infection. Of 28 women with anal HPV infection, 10 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN); 5 of the 10 also had AIN, whereas no woman had AIN in the absence of CIN. The study shows that AIN occurs and can be diagnosed endoscopically in a manner similar to CIN. Further detailed prospective studies on the natural history of AIN and of groups at risk are required.",NA

1989,Lancet,Indicators of effective cytological sampling of the uterine cervix.,"A case-control comparison of adequate and inadequate cervical smears (adequacy being defined as the successful detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and inadequacy as the failure to do so when disease was almost certainly present) was undertaken to determine whether indicators of effective cytological sampling could be identified. The association between inadequate smears and the absence of two types of normal epithelial cells (columnar cells of endocervical origin and immature metaplastic cells) was measured. A significant and substantial association was found between inadequate cervical smears and immature metaplastic cells and between inadequate smears and both types of cell. Endocervical cells alone were less likely to be found in inadequate than in adequate smears, but this association was not statistically significant.",NA
1989,Lancet,Relation between infection with a subtype of HPV16 and cervical neoplasia.,"A variant (HPV16b) of the previously described human papillomavirus (HPV)16 (now called HPV16a) has been identified by polymerase chain reaction assays. Compared with HPV16a, HPV16b has a 21bp deletion and several point mutations within the upstream regulatory region. All cervical carcinoma samples studied contained only HPV16a. HPV16b was found only rarely in cervical neoplasia but was common in the normal population.",NA
1988,Lancet,Oral contraceptive use and malignancies of the genital tract. Results from the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study.,"Of 47,000 women followed since 1968, those who had used oral contraceptives (ever-users) had a significantly higher incidence rate of cervical cancer than never-users. After standardisation of rates by age, parity, smoking, social class, number of previously normal cervical smears, and history of sexually transmitted disease, the excess was 41 per 100,000 woman-years for carcinoma-in-situ and 8 per 100,000 woman-years for invasive cervical cancer. Incidence increased with increasing duration of use: the standardised incidence rate for cervical cancer in women who had taken the pill for more than 10 years was four times than in never-users. Ever-users had a lower incidence of other uterine cancers (deficit 5 per 100,000 woman-years); a lower incidence of ovarian cancer was also found (deficit 4 per 100,000), but was not statistically significant. Overall, ever-users had an excess incidence for genital tract cancers 37 per 100,000 woman-years. This excess was mainly from carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix; the excess incidence of invasive cervical cancer was offset by the deficits in other uterine and ovarian cancers. Standardised mortality rates from genital cancer were similar in ever-users and never-users. Of relevance to clinical practice is the substantially different distribution of primary cancer sites: cervical cancer accounted for 75% of the invasive genital cancers and 74% of deaths from genital cancer in ever-users, but only 31% of the invasive cancers and 30% of deaths in never-users.",NA
1988,Lancet,Effect of cigarette smoking on cervical epithelial immunity: a mechanism for neoplastic change?,"Langerhans' cells in cervical epithelium in colposcopic biopsy specimens were identified by immunocytochemical staining for S100 protein and T6 (CD1) antigen, and their density was quantified. Possible cofactors for the development of cervical neoplasia were examined for any effect on the cell counts per unit area. Current cigarette smoking was associated with a significant decrease in the Langerhans' cell population in both normal epithelium and lesions due to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Ex-smokers tended to have cell counts between those of smokers and non-smokers. There was a dose-response relation between number of cigarettes smoked daily and effect on cell counts. These findings of a local immunological effect of smoking on cervical epithelium may explain the means by which cigarette smoking contributes to the development of cervical neoplasia.",NA

The %MR in both cervical biopsy specimens and exfoliated cells did not significantly differ in subjects with or without cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The measurement of the %MR of 9,11:9,12 octadecadienoic acid has no role in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.",NA

1987,Lancet,Human papillomavirus infections in women with and without abnormal cervical cytology.,"9295 smears, obtained from women attending three gynaecological hospitals for routine screening, were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 and HPV 16 and 18 infections by filter in-situ hybridisation. The data were compared with cytological findings. In women with normal cytological smears HPV infection was identified in about 10% of women aged between 15 and 50 years and in less than 5% of those aged over 50. In women with abnormal smears (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I, II, and III and invasive cancer) HPV infection was detected in 35-40%; this rate seemed to be age-independent. the Peak incidence of CIN appeared several years after that of HPV infection. In women aged greater than 30 years it also declined earlier than did HPV positivity. The age-group distribution of women with CIN I, II, and III differed significantly from that of patients with invasive cancer. Only about a third of HPV-positive patients remained virus-positive, probably because of fluctuations in virus production and the insensitivity of the test system used. It is possible that filter in-situ hybridisation underestimates the total rate of HPV infections by a factor of 2 to 3.",NA
1987,Lancet,Trends in mortality from cervical cancer in the Nordic countries: association with organised screening programmes.,"Time trends in mortality from cervical cancer in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden since the early 1950s were investigated in relation to the extent and intensity of organised screening programmes in these countries. In all five countries the cumulative mortality rates (0-74 years) fell between 1965 and 1982. In Iceland, where the nationwide programme has the widest target age range, the fall in mortality was greatest (80%). Finland and Sweden have nationwide programmes also; the mortality fell by 50% and 34%, respectively. In Denmark, where about 40% of the population are covered by organised programmes, the overall mortality fell by 25%, but in Norway, with only 5% of the population covered by organised screening, the mortality fell by only 10%. The results support the conclusion that organised screening programmes have had a major impact on the reduction in mortality from cervical cancer in the Nordic countries.",NA

In 25 of the 72 tumours c-myc proto-oncogene was overexpressed (ie, at levels 4-20 times higher than in normal tissues). Patients whose tumours showed c-myc overexpression had an eight-fold greater incidence of early relapse than the other patients (p = 0.001).

1987,Lancet,HPV 16 DNA in normal and malignant cervical epithelium: implications for the aetiology and behaviour of cervical neoplasia.,"Southern blot hybridisation showed that cervical cancer biopsy specimens from 31 of 47 (66%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 52-80%) patients contained HPV 16 homologous DNA sequences, with evidence of integration of viral genome into host cell chromosomes in 7. Normal ectocervical biopsies from 9 of 26 (35%, 95% CI 16-53%) control women contained HPV 16 DNA, and none showed evidence of integration. HPV 16 DNA positivity did not correlate with marital or sexual history, parity, use of oral contraceptives, or smoking habits in cases or controls, or with outcome of treatment in cases. HPV 16 DNA positivity was found less frequently with age less than 40 years old than with age greater than 40 in both cases (p less than 0.05) and controls (p less than 0.01). After age-adjustment there was no significant difference between cases and controls in frequency with which HPV 16 DNA was found. These data suggest that the association between HPV 16 and cervical neoplasia is age-mediated and that the presence of the viral genome may not always warrant intervention.",NA

Spontaneous regression of mild cervical atypia occurred in only 11 cases, and in 4 of these CIN recurred. The overall prevalence of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) in the study group, detected by filter DNA-DNA hybridisation of a cervical cytological specimen, was 39%. However, 22 of the 26 (85%) cases of progressive disease were positive for HPV 16.

In the 1977-81 period the screening rate was 47% (maximum 70-80% in the 20-40 age-group). The incidence rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 varied from 3.2/1000 in women under age 35 to 0.5/1000 in those over age 55. The average yearly incidence and death rates per 100 000 women over the age of 20 were calculated from gynaecological cancer registry records.

Good images of neoplastic lesions were obtained in most patients with active disease. In 1 patient with testicular teratoma and elevated human chorionic gonadotropin who had a normal computed tomography scan, the labelled antibody located microscopic disease in a lymph node, which was then removed. No false positive localisation was seen in patients with PLAP-negative tumours or sites of inflammation. This method may be helpful in the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of PLAP-positive neoplasms of testicular, ovarian, and cervical origin.",NA
1985,Lancet,Neutron brachytherapy is better than conventional radiotherapy in advanced cervical cancer.,"Californium-252 (252Cf), a fast-neutron emitting radioisotope, was used for neutron brachytherapy (NT) of 82 patients with advanced (stage III and IV) cervical cancer. The results were compared with caesium-137 brachytherapy; both isotopes were given in combination with high-dose fractionated pelvic radiotherapy. In patients with stage IIIB disease (ie, tumour to the pelvic side-wall), 252Cf intracavitary therapy resulted in 54% 5-year survival compared with 12% in the caesium group. To be effective, Cf-NT must be given before external beam (photon) therapy.",NA
1985,Lancet,Increased risk of cervical neoplasia in consorts of men with penile condylomata acuminata.,"19 (76%) of 25 women who had been the sole sexual consorts, for at least 1 year, of men with pre-existing penile condylomata acuminata had similar lesions of the lower genital tract. 9 (36%) of the women had an abnormal cervix as judged by cytology, colposcopy, and histology, and 7 (77%) of these 9 had associated human papillomavirus (HPV) infection detected by DNA/DNA hybridisation. None of 20 women in an age-matched control group had cytological or colposcopic evidence of cervical epithelial atypia. It is suggested that penile HPV infection in a male partner places a woman at risk of cervical neoplasia.",NA
1985,Lancet,Screening for wart virus infection in normal and abnormal cervices by DNA hybridisation of cervical scrapes.,"Cervical scrapings from 78 women attending a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic, family planning clinic, and colposcopy clinic were assayed for human papillomavirus type 6 (HPV-6) by DNA hybridisation. Results of hybridisation were compared with clinical, colposcopic, and cytological findings. Scrapings from 2 of the 4 women with genital warts gave positive results with the HPV probe. No HPV-6 DNA was detected in scrapings from 18 women attending an FPC whereas scrapings from 2 of 19 STD clinic patients with normal colposcopic and cytological examination were positive-this means that DNA hybridisation detected wart virus infection where previously none was suspected. HPV-6 DNA was detected in about 10% of cervical scrapings from women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) both before and after treatment. Indeed in 2 patients in whom viral DNA persisted after laser therapy, it was associated with local recurrence of neoplasia. This non-invasive technique is suitable for use as a screening test for HPV infection. In this study it identified women who have a high risk of developing CIN and in whom close cytological and colposcopic surveillance is indicated.",NA
1984,Lancet,"""Pap"" smear and the risk of cervical neoplasia: quantitative estimates from a case-control study.","The relation between Papanicolau (""Pap"") smear and the risk of cervical neoplasia was evaluated in a case-control study in which 145 women with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) were compared with 145 age-matched outpatient controls, and 191 cases of invasive cervical cancer were compared with 191 control subjects in hospital for acute conditions unrelated to any of the established or suspected risk factors for cervical cancer. Compared with women with no previous screening smear, the relative risk (RR) estimate for invasive cancer was 0.44 (with 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.80) for those who had had one smear and 0.20 (95% CI = 0.13-0.32) for those who had had two or more smears. The corresponding estimates for CIN were 0.27 (95% CI = 0.10-0.71) and 0.12 (95% CI = 0.06-0.25), respectively. The risk estimates for intervals of more than 5, 3-5, and less than 3 years were 0.36, 0.18, and 0.10 for invasive cancer, and 0.45, 0.31, and 0.07 for CIN. These results were not materially modified by adjustment for the major risk factors for cervical cancer, such as indicators of socioeconomic status and sexual habits. According to the estimates of this study, 64% of invasive cervical cancers could be prevented by screening at intervals of more than 5 years, an additional 18% by reducing the interval to 3-5 years, and a further 8% to less than 3 years.",NA
1983,Lancet,Neoplasia of the cervix uteri and contraception: a possible adverse effect of the pill.,"The incidence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia during a 10-year follow-up was determined in 6838 parous women who entered the Oxford-Family Planning Association contraceptive study while using oral contraceptives and 3154 parous women who entered the study while using an intrauterine device (IUD). Risk factors for cervical neoplasia, continuation of attendance at family planning clinics, and frequency of examination by cervical cytology were similar in the two groups. All 13 cases of invasive cancer occurred in women in the oral contraceptive group; 9 had more than 6 years' use of the pill. Both carcinoma-in-situ and dysplasia also occurred more frequently in the oral contraceptive group than in the IUD group, and when the two conditions were considered together there was a trend in incidence with duration of oral contraceptive use. The incidence for all three forms of neoplasia combined rose from 0.9 per 1000 woman-years in those with up to 2 years' pill use to 2.2 per 1000 woman-years in those with more than 8 years' pill use. Amongst IUD users, there was no such trend in incidence with duration of use: the rate fluctuated around 1.0 per 1000 woman-years. The great majority of cases of invasive cancer were detected by means of cervical smears and were treated while the disease was still curable. Long-term users of oral contraceptives should have regular cervical cytological examination.",NA
1983,Lancet,Serological evidence for the association of papillomavirus and cervical neoplasia.,"Serum was collected from patients with anogenital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and invasive squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. All sera were screened with a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for an IgG antibody to a group-specific papillomavirus antigen. All three study groups had higher antibody levels than did control groups of children and adults. The invasive-cancer group had a higher geometric mean titre than the CIN or anogenital wart groups. It is proposed that patients with invasive squamous cancer of the cervix are exposed to human papillomavirus (HPV) antigens and that HPV has a role in the aetiology of cervical squamous-cell carcinoma.",NA
1982,Lancet,Human genital cancer: synergism between two virus infections or synergism between a virus infection and initiating events?,"It is proposed that human genital cancer results from a ""promoting"" papillomavirus infection and initiating events, frequently caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. This hypothesis is based on the demonstration of DNA from different types of papillomaviruses in some cervical cancer biopsy samples and in premalignant lesions; on studies revealing the initiator-like functions of HSV infections; and on analogous interactions of papillomavirus infections with initiators in the induction of certain animal and human carcinomas. The model reconciles seroepidemiological data linking HSV to human genital cancer with the apparent difficulties in finding HSV DNA by biopsy in genital cancer.",NA
1982,Lancet,Importance of the male factor in cancer of the cervix.,"A woman's risk of cervical cancer is generally thought to be related to her sexual behaviour. The sexual background of her male partners is also important. In some societies, a woman's risk of cancer of the cervix will depend less on her own behaviour than on that of her partner. Male sexual behaviour, particularly in relation to prostitution, may account for two hitherto unexplained features of the epidemiology of this disease--the extremely high incidence in Latin America and the decline in mortality this century. If this is so and men carry the aetiological agent, it will be important to discover whether they do so for short or long periods.",NA
1982,Lancet,A new marker for human cancer cells. 1 The Ca antigen and the Ca1 antibody.,"In a search for antibodies that might distinguish between malignant and non-malignant cells a panel of matched pairs of hybrid cells produced by fusion of diploid fibroblasts with malignant cells originating from a cervical carcinoma was used as a screen. Each pair consisted of a hybrid in which malignancy was suppressed and a malignant segregant derived from this hybrid. A monoclonal antibody, designated Ca1, was found that discriminated absolutely between the hybrids in which malignancy was suppressed and the malignant segregants. This antibody detected an antigen present in the cell membranes of a wide variety of malignant human cells lines but not of diploid human cell strains. The antigen was found in very low concentrations, if at all, in homogenates of normal adult or fetal tissues. It could be immunoprecipitated by the Ca1 antibody from extracts of malignant cells but not from extracts of non-malignant cells. After reduction, the immunoprecipitated antigen separated in sodium dodecyl sulphate acrylamide gels as two bands with proximate molecular masses of 390 000 and 350 000. These two components had a properties of glycoproteins with a high carbohydrate content; both bound the Ca1 antibody. The antigenic determinant resisted boiling at 100 degrees C and extraction by range of organic solvents. The binding of the Ca1 antibody to the antigen was substantially reduced by treatment of the antigen with neuraminidase, and the antigenic determinant was largely destroyed by certain endoglycosidases and by extensive proteolysis. Pending its further characterisation, this antigen had been called the Ca antigen.",NA
1981,Lancet,Case-control study of the husbands of women with dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix uteri.,"The husbands of married women with cervical dysplasia, carcinoma-in-situ, or invasive carcinoma of the cervix who, in an earlier study, had claimed to have had no sexual partner other than their husband, were interviewed to determine whether the risk of cervical epithelial abnormalities in the women could be related to their husband's sexual background. Of 322 women previously studied, 57 were eligible for this study and the husbands of 31 of them were interviewed together with the husbands of a control group, matched for age and age at first intercourse. The number of sexual partners reported by the husband was found to be a significant risk factor, with a relative risk of 7.8 for 15 or more partners outside marriage. The relative risk for women who smoked was 7.0, and this was independent of any of the sexual risk factors. The findings for subgroups of women with invasive carcinoma and with dysplasia or carcinoma-in-situ were similar. The data strongly support the view that an infectious agent is involved in the aetiology of cancer of the cervix and suggest that smoking may have an independent carcinogenic action.",NA
1981,Lancet,Application of human leucocyte interferon in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,"15 patients with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were treated with crude human leucocyte interferon (HLI) for 3 weeks before surgical removal of the tumour. 9 patients were given HLI topically and intramuscularly and 6 topically only. In 3 patients the surgical material was free from tumour cells, in 3 it showed a lower grade of carcinoma, and in 9 the findings remained unchanged. In only 1 patient the tumour metastasised to the lymph nodes. Typically a tumour regressed to about a third of its original size. There was a sharp distinction between the tumour mass and the healthy tissue manifested in the formation of a fibrous wall. On the basis of the scores--i.e., stromal response, relation between tumour-cell and macrophage activity and reactivity, and reactivity of the original lymph nodes--the overall appraisal of the response caused by HLI therapy was as follows: in 6 patients excellent, in 5 very good, in 1 moderate, in 2 poor, and in 1 no response. It is suggested that HLI is suitable for administration both before and after surgery in patients with cervical cancer of grade I or II. If stroma cannot be induced to respond within 21 days of treatment, HLI application should be discontinued.",NA
1980,Lancet,Prevention of postoperative lymphopenia and granulocytosis by epidural analgesia.,"Blood leucocyte-counts, cortisol, and glucose were measured in twelve healthy premenopausal women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy during either general anaesthesia (six women) or epidural analgesia (T4 to S5) (six women). Surgery during general anaesthesia caused significant lymphopenia 6 and 9 h after skin incision and significantly increased granulocyte-counts 6, 9, and 24 h after skin incision. Epidural analgesia prevented lymphopenia and reduced granulocytosis to about 40% of that seen in the group receiving general anaesthesia. The normal increase in plasma glucose and cortisol during and after surgery was abolished by epidural analgesia. These results indicate that neurogenic stimuli from the surgical area, probably through their influence on adrenal hormones (cortisol and adrenaline), are the main mediators of postoperative lymphopenia and are partly responsible for postoperative granulocytosis. Inhibition of the endocrine-metabolic response to surgery may prevent postoperative immunodepression.",NA
1979,Lancet,Distinction between endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma with immunoperoxidase staining of carcinoembryonic antigen in routine histological tissue specimens.,"The differential diagnosis of endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas can be improved by the demonstration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in tissue by means of immunoperoxidase staining. Tissue from 131 (80%) of 163 patients with endocervical adenocarcinoma but only 11 (8%) of 137 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma was CEA-positive. The commonest exceptions were endocervical mesonephroid adenocarcinomas (which were CEA-negative) and endometrial adenosquamous carcinomas (which were CEA-positive). After exclusion of these on simple morphological criteria, 86 of 107 endocervical adenocarcinomas (80%) were CEA-positive, and all 122 endometrial adenocarcinomas were CEA-negative. The remarkable difference in the expression of CEA between endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas suggests a novel application of immunohistochemistry in routine clinical practice.",NA
1979,Lancet,"""Incessant ovulation"" and ovarian cancer.","A case-control study of 150 ovarian cancer patients under the age of 50 and individually matched controls was done to study the influence of fertility and oral contraceptive use on the risk of ovarian cancer. The risk decreased with increasing numbers of live births, with increasing numbers of incomplete pregnancies, and with the use of oral contraceptives. These three factors can be amalgamated into a single index of protection--""protected time""--by considering them all as periods of anovulation. The complement of protected time--viz., ""ovulatory age"", the period between menarche and diagnosis of ovarian cancer (or cessation of menses) minus ""protected time""--was strongly related to risk of ovarian cancer. Other factors found to be associated with increased ovarian cancer risk were obesity, cervical polyps, and gallbladder disease. Women who had an ""immediate"" intolerance to oral contraceptive use had a fourfold increased risk of ovarian cancer. 7 patients, but no controls, could recall a family history of ovarian cancer.",NA
1979,Lancet,"Does screening by ""Pap"" smears help prevent cervical cancer? A case-control study.","The Papanicolaou (Pap)-smear history of 212 cases of invasive cervical cancer was compared with that of 1060 age-matched controls drawn from neighbours. In the 5 years before the year of diagnosis 32% of the cases had been screened by Pap smear, compared with 56% of the controls. This difference was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and indicated a relative risk of invasive cancer of 2.7 in women who had not been screened by Pap smear, compared with those who had. Differences in Pap-smear history between cases and controls persisted when the data were stratified by age, income, education, marital history, smoking habit, employment status, and access to medical care. These results support the belief that the Pap smear is an effective screening procedure for invasive cervical cancer.",NA
1978,Lancet,Cancer-specific density changes in lymphocytes after stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin.,"A fluorescence polarisation technique (""S.C.M. test"") for detecting responses to phytohaemagglutinin revealed that the responsive lymphocytes from patients with malignant disease had an abnormal distribution after centrifugation through lymphocyte separation medium. In a small blind series the technique accurately distinguished patients with histologically proven malignancies from those with nonmalignant disease and normal people.",NA
1978,Lancet,Radiotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen. Report of a Medical Research Council Working Party.,"The M.R.C. Working Party has coordinated randomised clinical trials to assess hyperbaric oxygen as a sensitiser in radiotherapy. 1669 patients were registered in these studies between 1963 and 1976. Hyperbaric oxygen significantly improved both survival and local tumour control after radiotherapy for head-and-neck tumours and for advanced carcinoma of the cervix. In carcinoma of the bronchus there seemed to be some improvement in survival but this was not statistically singificant. In carcinoma of the bladder hyperbaric oxygen has shown no benefit. Centres already equipped with hyperbaric chambers should continue to use them for those types of tumour shown to benefit. Since hyperbaric oxygen treatment makes great demands on medical and other staff, extension of its use must await comparison with other methods for improving radiotherapy which are now being evaluated.",NA
1978,Lancet,Cervical cancer in younger women.,"Cervical cancer does not begin in women at some vague mid-procreative term, but is a concomitant of early sexual activity. In Brighton the mean age of patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the cervix has been falling, from 50 in 1967 to 35 by 1977. In one year abnormal cells were found in cervical smears from 24 teenage girls (5 aged 16, 2 aged 17, 8 aged 18 and 9 aged 19), and in 4 of these teenage cases malignancy was subsequently proved histologically. Until the aetiology of the  disease is established no lower age limit should be set for cervical screening; all young women should be entitled and encouraged to have cervical cytology tests.",NA
1978,Lancet,Mortality from carcinoma of cervix uteri in Britain.,"A review of age-specific mortality-rates from cervical cancer in England and Wales and in Scotland in 1968--76 shows a decline, striking at some ages. In England and Wales, however, there has been an increase at ages 25--34 and, possibly, at 15--24. Signs of such an increase are also seen in Scotland for the age-groups 25--34 when figures for two regions with well-established screening programmes are removed. Indeed trends in these regions compared with those for the rest of Scotland support the benefit of cervical screening.",NA
1978,Lancet,Critical assessment of dilatation and curettage in 1029 women.,"Of 1029 dilatation-and-curettage operations carried out in a 12-month period, more than half were in women aged under 40, and 38% were for menstrual disturbances. The yield of intrauterine disease in these groups was low--curettage for post-menopausal bleeding or discharge in 150 women detected 15 endomettrial carcinomas and a similar number of other endometrial lesions. The complication-rate resulting from curettage was 1.7%--i.e., equivalent to the overall rate of detection of endometrial carcinoma. Selection of patients submitted to uterine curettage could be better, but postmenopausal bleeding remains an indication for mandatory uterine curettage.",NA
1978,Lancet,Women with positive cervical smears but without surgical intervention. A follow-up study.,"By a collaborative effort among British cytopathologists, 101 women were identified who had had unsuspected ""positive"" cervical smears but who, after at least 2 years, had still escaped biopsy through refusal, default, or failure to trace. Of these, 31 still could not be traced; 10 were traced but could not be further examined (8 because they refused); 7 had clinically diagnosed carcinoma of the cervix; and the remaining 53 had further smears and/or biopsies after a mean interval of 5.2 years. In 19 of the 53 the smear had become negative or biopsy showed no lesion. Regression was confined to women aged under 40 at the time of the initial positive smear. In 20 cases biopsy showed dysplasia or carcinoma-in-situ, in 3 microinvasive carcinoma, and in 3 occult invasive carcinoma. Of the 7 women who presented clinically with carcinoma of the cervix, this caused death in 5.",NA
1978,Lancet,Sperm basic proteins in cervical carcinogenesis: Correlation with socioeconomic class.,"Two types of basic protein, a histone and a protamine, were separated from single ejaculates of human sperm and a ratio between their contents in a given number of sperm established. The ratio varied widely in different males and correlated with ranking by social class: the lower the social class, the greater the proportion of protamine. Statistically similar correlations link social class with the incidence of venereal disease and the incidence of in-situ carcinoma of the cervix, both of which are epidemiological variables in squamous cervical cancer. The basic proteins of the sperm head, especially the protamines, may thus also have a role in the aetiology of squamous cervical cancer.",NA
1978,Lancet,Uterine cervical cytology and young women.,"9000 women aged 20 years and under who had cervical smears taken in the 10-year period 1967-76 were studied. The number of young women with abnormal smears rose, but this increase was in proportion to the number screened. Abnormal smears were found in 145 (1.6%) cases. Follow-up for periods of up to 10 years showed that in over half the cases subsequent smears had reverted to normal without treatment. 19 of the 145 patients progressed to have smears which were suggestive of malignancy: 16 of these were diagnosed histologically as carcinoma-in-situ, and the other 3 were histological dysplasias. At follow-up no cases of carcinoma-in-situ were found in women under 21. No cases of invasive cancer were found on the initial biopsy. One microinvasive cancer was found in a woman aged 26 on a second biopsy 6 1/2 years after the first atypical smear. The preclinical cases were detected from smears taken during pregnancy, or, in the case of the one possibly nulliparous girl, during a gynaecological consultation. These women did not attend family-planning clinics until after a pregnancy.",NA
1976,Lancet,Rapid decrease in plasma-triiodothyronine during surgery and epidural analgesia independent of afferent neurogenic stimuli and of cortisol.,"Changes in circulating triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), binding of thyroid hormones to plasma proteins (resin-T3 test), cortisol, and glucose were evaluated in sixteen patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. In eight of the patients afferent neurogenic impulses from the surgical area were blocked during and after operation by epidural analgesia. These patients were pain-free, and the normal stress-induced increase in cortisol and glucose was abolished. During epidural analgesia and general anesthesia plasma-T3 fell rapidly and values in the hypothyroid range were found 6 hours after skin incision. Similarly, an increase in the resin-T3 test reflected decreased binding of T3 to plasma proteins. Plasma-T4 decreased slightly during surgery and epidural analgesia (as it does when other anaesthetics are given), but increased during general anaesthesia. These results indicated that the alterations in thyroid hormones and their binding to plasma proteins after surgery are not caused by a stress-induced increase in plasma-cortisol or by neurogenic afferent stimuli from the surgical area, factors which are both known to affect concentrations of other hormones.",NA
1976,Lancet,Trial of new cervical spatula.,"A trial comparing the relative values of the 'Armovical' and Ayre's spatulae showed a significant improvement of the former over the latter in sampling endocervical epithelium. No such difference was found in their ability to detect epithelial atypia. However, it was confirmed that if (at each attendance of a patient) the cervix was sampled twice instead of once the incidence of atypical smears was increased.",NA
1975,Lancet,Treatment of radiation-induced gastrointestinal distress with acetylsalicylate.,"Highly buffered acetylsalicylate was used to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal side-effects of radiotherapy in 28 women who were receiving treatment for uterine cancer. In a double-blind, balanced, and randomised trial, acetylsalicylate significantly reduced the number of bowel motions and relieved abdominal pain and flatulence.",NA
1975,Lancet,Postoperative thrombosis in Thai women.,"The 125-I-labelled fibrinogen infusion test and phlebography were used to detect evidence of the postoperative development of deep-vein thrombosis (D.V.T) in the legs of 117 Thai women who had abdominal hysterectomy for benign conditions and of 52 who had major pelvic surgery for malignant disease of the ovary, uterus, and cervix. D.V.T. was demonstrated in 1.7% and 3.8%, respectively. Comparison of these results with an almost identical study in Oxford showed that D.V.T. was significantly more common in women in England - i.e., 12% and 35% in those with benign or malignant diseases, respectively.",NA
1975,Lancet,"Chronic antigenic stimulation, herpesvirus infection, and cancer in transplant recipients.","An increased incidence of malignancy has been reported in transplant recipients. The pathogenesis of this increase was originally attributed to immunosuppressive therapy. However, not all tumours are increased in proportion to their occurrence in the general population-75% of reported tumours are lymphorproliferative or carcinoma of the skin, lip, or cervix. This cannot be explained by impaired immunosurveillance, and alternative hypotheses must be considered. 90% of transplant recipients develop clinical or serological evidence of herpesvirus infection. Herpesviruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphorproliferative tumours and carcinoma of the skin and cervix. They can remain in latent form and be reactivated by allogeneic stimulation and/or immunosuppression. These viruses localise to skin, cervix, and neural tissue-i.e., exactly those sites where cancer develops in transplant patients. Herpesvirus infections in association with the presence of an allogeneic graft in an immunosuppressed patient may be responsible for the increased incidence of both lymphoproliferative tumours and carcinoma of the skin, lip, and cervix in the transplant recipient.",NA
1975,Lancet,Increased incidence of malignancy during chronic renal failure.,"The incidence of cancer in 646 dialysis/transplant patients before uraemia developed, during the period of progressive uraemia, and post-transplantation was compared. 10 tumours (3 breast, 2 kidney, 1 leukaemia, 1 lung, 1 insulinoma, 1 thyroid, 1 cervix in situ) developed in 9 patients during the period of progressive uraemia, a significant increase over the expected number in the age-matched general population. 6 of these patients have received transplants and have no evidence of recurrent disease 6 months to 4 years post-transplantation. 11 de-novo tumours have developed in 530 transplant recipients (4 cervix in situ, 2 skin, 2 reticulum-cell sarcoma, 1 lip, 1 dysgerminoma, 1 colon)--a significant increase over the age-matched general population. The cancers in the uraemic patients are relatively common types of mesenchymal tumours while the cancers in the transplant recipients are epithelial and lymphoproliferative. This difference may reflect the presence of the graft in the transplant patient or may be due to different patterns of immunosuppression in these two populations.",NA
1975,Lancet,Controlled trial of repeated halothane anaesthetics in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with radium.,"39 patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix who were treated with radium and required repeated general anaesthetics were randomised to halothane and control groups. Their serum-alanine-aminotransferase (S.G.P.T.) levels were measured before each general anaesthetic, and those patients whose S.G.P.T. levels rose above 100 I.U. per litre were freed from the restriction determined by the initial allocation and treated as indicated clinically. None of the 21 patients in the control group had S.G.P.T. levels rising above 100 I.U. per litre. 4 out of 18 patients in the halothane group developed S.G.P.T. levels above 100 i.u. per litre before their third radium treatment. None of these had any symptoms or alteration in other liver-function tests, but liver biopsies in 2 of these patients showed changes characteristic of Hepatitis. Arbitrary selection of 18 out of the 39 patients would only give rise to the degree of abnormality observed in the halothane-treated group with a probability of about 0-02. In the patients studied who required repeated general anaesthetics at short time intervals, the monitoring of S.G.P.T. levels before each operation was useful screen for liver damage and may have reduced postoperative hepatic necrosis by preventing further anaesthetics with halothane when the liver was already damaged.",NA
1975,Lancet,Controlled prospective study of the effect on liver function of multiple exposures to halothane.,"Patients who had received halothane within a periof of one year and who required another anaesthetic were allocated at random to be given halothane or a control anaesthetic, the control being fiben using halothane-free apparatus. There were 76 patients entries in each group. Serum-glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase (S.G.O.T.) levels were measured before the anaesthetics and serially postoperatively for two to three weeks. The S.G.O.T. levels in the halothane group were significantly higher than in the controls. High levels were confined to patients who had had less than four previous halothane anaesthetics, increases above normal in the remainder and in the controls being rate. 1 patient in the halothane group had an S.G.O.T. of 440 I.U. per litre and hepatocellular necrosis on liver biopsy. 2 patients in the halothane group whose S.G.O.T.s rose to more than twice normal showed a similar reaction to re-exposure to halothane, although they had not shown a reaction to an intervening control anaesthetic.",NA
1975,Lancet,Costs of detecting and treating cancer of the uterine cervix in North-East Scotland in 1971.,"In 1971 the Aberdeen cytology service handled 22,291 cervical smears--threequarters from women participating in a screening programme and the rest from women with symptoms who were referred to hospital.  As a result of screening, 56 preclinical cases of cancer of the cervix uteri were treated in hospital; 13 others were classified as less than preclinical.  Of the gynaecological patients 20 had clinical cancer and 29 had less than preclinical lesions.  From estimates of the costs of running the cytology service and of hospital inpatient costs it is possible to derive figures for detecting and treating preclinical cases and investigating and treating clinical cases.  The cost to the Health Service of detecting and treating each preclinical case was slightly less (445 pounds) than that for impatient treatment of each clinical case (487 pounds).  However, if mass screening were abandoned cytology would almost certainly continue for women referred to hospital with symptoms, and, if the costs of taking and examining these smears is taken into account, the cost per clinical case treated nearly doubles to 835 pounds.  Had outpatient and other follow-up costs been included, the difference in service costs would be even greater.  Comparison of these figures assumes the controversial point that preclinical cancer will always progress to invasive carcinoma if left untreated and takes no account of inflation and discounting.",NA
