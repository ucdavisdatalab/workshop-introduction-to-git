# 1. What is Version Control

Version control describes a process of storing and organizing multiple versions/copies of documents that you create.  Approaches to version control range from the simple to the complex and can involve the use of various human workflows and/or software applications to accomplish the overall goal of storing and managing multiple versions of the same document(s).  

Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that looks something like this:

```
url <- "http://www.online-image-editor.com//styles/2014/images/example_image.png"
```
